'''''The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas from 1875, painted by [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (she became better known as Lady Butler after her marriage to [[William Butler (British Army officer)|William Butler]] in 1877). The painting is {{convert|97.2|cm|in|sp=us}} high and {{convert|216.2|cm|in|sp=us}} wide. It is in the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref name=VW-QB&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/misc/thompson1.html ''The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103030519/http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/misc/thompson1.html |date=3 January 2007 }}, Victorian Web&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thompson based the painting on the account of the battle in a book written by Captain [[William Siborne]], the ''History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815'', first published in 1844. The painting portrays the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]], of the [[British Army]], on 16 June 1815, at the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]]. The battle, part of the Waterloo Campaign of the [[Hundred Days]], was just two days prior to the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The regiment held off attacks from French cavalry at [[Quatre Bras]]. Thompson shows the regiment formed in a [[infantry square|square]] in a field of rye, withstanding attacks, at approximately 17:00, from [[lancer]]s and [[cuirassier]]s led by [[Marshal Ney]].&lt;ref name=VW-QB /&gt;

Thompson went to great lengths to create models for her work.  In July 1874, she arranged for 300 soldiers from the [[Royal Engineers]] to pose in a reconstruction of the square formation, and to fire their rifles, to recreate the smoky scene.   Several of the soldiers also modelled in Thompson's studio.   Thompson observed horses at [[Sanger's Circus]] and the [[Household Cavalry|Horse Guards]] riding school, as models for the French cavalry.  She also arrange for a group of children to trample down a field of rye in [[Henley-on-Thames]], to recreate the setting.

She had copies of the historic uniforms made by a government manufacturer in Pimlico.   However, the [[shako]] she depicts the regiment wearing is incorrect. Whilst nearly all [[List of Regiments of Foot|Regiments of Foot]] in the British Army had adopted the false fronted Belgic shako since 1812, so the replica uniforms were correct for a standard line regiment, the 28th Regiment continued to wear the older stovepipe shakos during the Hundred Days campaign.  The older headwear can be seen clearly in [[William Barnes Wollen]]'s painting: ''28th Gloucester Regiment at Waterloo''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The heavy gold frame bears the inscription "Egypt" at the top, and "Quatre-Bras 1815" below.

The work was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1875, the year after Elizabeth Thompson exhibited her acclaimed ''[[The Roll Call]]''.  It was bought by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], Melbourne, Australia, in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/4408 The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras], National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne &lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary and character list==

==="A Deal in Wheat"===

====Plot====

:I.	The first of the five sections of the story, entitled "The Bear- Wheat at Sixty-Two", takes place in rural [[Kansas]]. Sam Lewiston leaves his wife, Emma, home on the ranch while he goes into town one last time to try to sell his wheat to Bridges &amp; Co., Grain Dealers before being forced out of the market. At sixty-two cents a bushel, Lewiston can no longer afford to raise wheat and must take a job with his wife’s brother in Chicago.

:II.	The next section, "The Bull- Wheat at a Dollar-Ten", introduces the two main players of the Chicago-run wheat business, the bear and the bull: Treslow and Hornung. When Treslow had let the price fall to sixty-two cents, Hornung had almost run him out of business. Instead, Mr. Gates makes a deal with Treslow, on behalf of Hornung, to sell him one hundred thousand bushels for export at $1.10 each.

:III. Hornung has grown to dominate wheat sales at $1.50 a bushel. One day in "The Pit", a mysterious man named Kennedy sells one thousand bushels to three of Hornung’s men: Going, Kimbark, and Merriam. They get word that a total of twenty-five thousand bushels are being sold in Chicago by someone other than Hornung. Hornung instructs them to continue buying but, with The Bear supposedly out of the market, they do not know who they are buying from.

:IV. The fourth section, "The Belt Line", takes place in Hornung’s home. His broker, Billy, and a detective named Cyrus Ryder are there to discuss the now eighty thousand bushels he has purchased. Ryder reveals that the bushels are the same ones that Treslow had purchased to export. He had been shuttling them around the city on trains, making it appear as if they had just arrived. Hornung laughs upon finding out he has been cheated, and decides to further raise the price.

:V. The final section of the story, "The Bread Line", describes Sam Lewiston’s life in Chicago. He stands in the [[Bread lines|bread line]] with many other poor, hungry workers who rely on the bakery’s nightly giveaways, but the price of wheat has put too much of a strain on the bakery. Lewiston manages to find work as a street cleaner and climb the rankings to success but, because of his experiences as a farmer and a worker, his resentment towards the operators of the wheat business will not die.

===="The Wife of Chino"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	The story starts off with "Chino’s Wife", in which Lockwood, the superintendent of the Hand-over-fist Gravel Mine in [[Placer County, California]], sits in solitude on his porch smoking tobacco after dinner. He graduated from the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Columbia School of Mines]] and has since spent his life in isolated Western mining communities. He enjoys isolation, and spends every evening admiring the scenery and fantasizing about Felice Zavalla, a beautiful [[Mexican American|Mexican]] woman married to one of his employees.

:II.	"Madness", documents Lockwood’s strong desire to be married to Felice despite his inability to understand her. He has never seen the world or socialized much, having studied for the first part of his life and worked for the latter. His isolation causes him to get carried away with emotions, and he is convinced he should have Felice.

:III.	In "Chino Goes to Town", Lockwood begins finding excused to interact with Felice, such as to give her mail, until he at once realizes that he has crossed the line and begins to avoid her entirely. He, instead, buries himself in his work until an accident in the mine breaks his foot. He usually goes to the Iowa Hill Post Office every couple of weeks with Chino to deliver the brick of gold collected from the mine, but his injury prevents him from going. He is left with nothing but thoughts of Felice to ease the pain.

:IV.	In the section, "A Dispatch from the Express Messenger", Felice confronts Lockwood and asks why he has been avoiding her. She gave him a look that told him she had made a mistake with Chino. Just when Lockwood realizes that he will not keep himself from having an affair with Felice he gets a message from [[Iowa Hill, California|Iowa Hill]] informing him of a criminal named Reno Kid on the trail. The messenger advises him not to leave, but Chino was already on his way. Lockwood realizes he has no other options, and struggles his way onto a horse and takes off.

:V.	"The Trail" documents Lockwood’s pursuit of Chino. He almost reaches Iowa Hill with no sign of him or Reno Kid, so he turns around to search harder. He eventually hears a horse galloping in the darkness and assumes it to be Reno Kid and shoots, but it is Chino.

:VI.	"The Discovery of Felice" begins when Lockwood arrives back at the Zavalla’s house and confesses his actions to Felice. Felice fetches the doctor and, as he examines Chino’s wound, she tells Lockwood that now they can be together. Lockwood, however, suddenly sees Felice in a different light. She appears savage and unfaithful.

===="A Bargain with Peg-Leg"====

=====Plot=====
:This story describes Bunt McBride’s account of Peg-Leg Smith, an infamous one-legged criminal. Bunt retells the story on his break from the night shift at the mine.

:Peg-Leg amputated his own leg and fashioned himself one from a tree stump after he was shot. He was known for his nastiness and spent his life trying to get people to stop using cuss words. Bunt encountered him at a bar in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] when Bunt was just a teenager. He was there watching his friend, Clarense, play a gambling game with some men that involved taking their temperatures. Clarence won, and the guys start accusing him of cheating. Peg-Leg had been sleeping in the back room, but he appeared and tackled Clarence from across the room. Bunt jumped to Clarence’s defense and pulled off Peg-Leg’s leg. Knowing he was in trouble, he chucked the wood out the window, grabbed Peg-Leg’s gun from the back room, and took off across the street. Outside, a kid had gone to retrieve the leg and went to hand it to Peg-Leg, but Bunt grabbed it. Peg-Leg assured Bunt that he would come after him someday. Bunt knew what Peg-Leg is capable of and did not want to live in fear, but he also knew his weakness, so he made a deal with Peg-leg to never swear again in exchange for his safety. Peg-Leg was desperate to have at least one convert, so he gave in.

:Three years later, Bunt says, he came across Peg-Leg again in Sonora, Arizona. The town was full of men seeking gold. He got word that a hotel was on fire and rushed over to see Peg-Leg at the window of the flaming building. People below were yelling for him to jump, promising to catch him on a blanket. Bunt starts chucking before he can finish the story. There hadn’t been a blanket there.

* Bunt McBride
* Peg-Leg Smith
* Clarence

===="The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock"====

=====Plot=====
:This story, like the last, describes Bunt McBride’s account of the life of a Western criminal, Cock-Eye Blacklock. Bunt and the narrator finish dinner by the campfire and ride out into the [[Idaho]] desert because it is Bunt’s night to ride the herd. Bunt has lived in the West for a long time and is wise when it comes to herding.

:Bunt begins his story by recounting a herding experience in a Nevada blizzard. He and Cock-Eye Blacklock rubbed [[Tobacco water|tobacco juice]] in their eyes to stay awake. Blacklock was a bad man and had killed a lot of people. Bunt says that he went bad about two years after that, though, He traveled around gambling, taking all the money from a community before moving on. He got through [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] and was making his way through Nevada when he shot a kid in Reno and headed up to a mining camp in Placer County, California. He immediately got into trouble there, too, and before long was driven out of camp.

:Bunt lived nearby in Iowa Hill at the time, and he used to take weekly fishing trips to the [[American River]] with his boss. On one trip they noticed that all the fish had been shot out of the river. The Fish Commissioners of the State assigned a guard to the area, but the fish kept dying. Blacklock was an obvious suspect, so Bunt, the Boss, and a marshal set up shooting boxes in trees to stand watch and try to catch him in the act. Unsuccessful for weeks, they caught a break one day with the help from a local dog named Sloppy Weather. Blacklock [[Blast fishing|threw dynamite into the water to kill the fish]], but Sloppy Weather jumped in to fetch the dynamite and bring it back. Blacklock ran, but the dog chased him until the dynamite went off and they both got caught in the explosion. On his grave they wrote, "Moral: A hook and line is good enough fish-tackle for any honest man".

:The sun rises over the desert just as Bunt finishes the story. He and the narrator ride back into camp.

===="A Memorandum of Sudden Death"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story the narrator reads a manuscript written by Arthur Staples Karslake just before he died while serving in the [[United States Cavalry]]. The narrator has no personal connection to the author but has received permission from Patterson Karslake, the author’s brother, to publish the manuscript. He gets it form Juan Tejada, a harness-maker in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], who has been keeping it for a bone collector by the name of Bass while he is on a trip in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]]. Parts of the manuscript are in pen and parts are in pencil. The narrator interjects periodically while reading the manuscript to explain that the pieces are in fragments.

:The manuscript begins with Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and Karslake spotting 8 Native Americans following them while they are jogging. They stop to get water, and Karslake writes the first account while they are stopped. In it he refers to them as "bucks". They continue on, and the next day it appears as if there are 9. The "bucks" charge towards them, but veer off at the last minute, then circle around and continue following them. They constantly move in and out of shooting range, but Idaho manages to kill one of them. Shots are fired periodically, but each day the four men continue on and each night they set up camp. On the fifth and final day of the account Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and all of their horses have died. Karsdale describes a feeling of revelation he experiences as he weakens and death grows closer. He explains that, as death is upon him, he begins to understand the secret of life. He identifies himself and the other men he was with, and he leaves his unfinished work to his brother, Patterson Karslake.

===="Two Hearts That Beat as One"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story, Bunt McBride, shocked that Mr. Dixon is not familiar with The Three Black Crows, retells a story of one of their missions on the Pacific arranged, as usual, by Cyrus Ryder. This story is the first of four in the collection about The Three Black Crows.

:Barreto Palachi was a revolutionary trying to get to San Francisco to smuggle arms, but he could not get there without being arrested. Cyrus Ryder sent Bunt, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan to meet with Palachi’s agent, Esperanza Ulivarri. Bunt was not looking forward to the meeting, as he notes that he is not good with females. Esperanza instructed the four men on how to meet Palachi in [[San Diego]], and gave them half of a calling card to match with the other half that she was to give him. They were struck by her beauty, and Hardenberg and Strokher immediately began fighting over who would have her when they left her office. The arguing continued aboard the [[schooner]], and on a calm day they held a boxing match. It was very competitive but ended in a draw.

:When they arrived in the [[San Diego Bay|San Diego Harbor]] Esperanza and another woman appeared in a rowboat. The woman was Palachi in disguise and, while he climbed aboard, Hardenberg and Strokher both get into the [[Rowing|rowboat]] and stay behind with Esperanza.

===="The Dual Personality of Slick Dick Nickerson"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	The first section of this story takes place in Cyrus Ryder’s office in San Francisco. The Three Crows, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan, are ready for their next assignment, and are considering sailing to [[Point Barrow]] in Alaska where some Russians are hunting [[sea otter]]s. Their skins can be sold to China for great profit. Ryder tells them that an agent of his named Dick Nickerson must accompany them. He used to be a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher but he hit his head one day and, when he regained consciousness, he had [[Amnesia|no memory of his past]]. A month after this meeting the team departed on the Bertha Miller.

:II.	The sail to Alaska is a rough journey filled with poor weather and freezing temperatures. They finally arrive and locate the hunters, to whom they pretend to be a rescue boat searching for survivors from a nearby steam whaler wreck. Strokher remains onboard while the others befriend the Russians, get them drunk, and steal the otter skins.

:III.	The Bertha Miller departs, but Dick Nickerson takes a bad fall on the deck and hits his head. His condition improves after a few days, but he does not remember why they are there. The others explain the purpose of their mission and show him the skins to try to probe his memory. They arrive in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] and, immediately upon disembarking, Dick goes to the customs office. He tells an officer that he is a Methodist minister being detained on a pirate ship with stolen goods. The Three Crows frantically leave the port and, thinking they are being pursued by a [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. cutter]], burn the otter skins. The cutter approaches, and two men on board inform them that their crewmember broke into the American consul and resisted arrest.

===="The Ship That Saw a Ghost"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story Mr. Dixon describes a dangerous mission, B. 300, he attempted with The Three Black Crows aboard the ''Glarus''. Everyone thought they were heading back up to San Francisco from [[Callao]] but, in fact, they were traveling further south. Dixon says that the mission gave the ''Glarus'' a bad reputation, and now no one in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is willing to take her out again. They think she is haunted.

:The sailors had seen nothing but ocean for days, and the isolation was getting to them. They were looking for an island that a boat had come across 200 years prior. Dixon does not say what they did there for fear of getting in trouble with the [[Admiralty law|maritime law]], but it was evil. As they were leaving the island something came out of the sea that killed twenty men within a week. After another week there were six men remaining, and they all died on the island. Dixon recalls that each of the men on the ''Glarus'' felt uneasy about the mission. He felt like they were being watched. One night Strokher said he fell asleep while on watch and awoke to find a ship in the distance. It was unusual looking, with three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and no sails, and looked abandoned and frightening. The same night their shaft broke. They decided to continue for the island, but for days the wind would not let them budge. They had no choice but to turn around and saw the old ship in the distance behind them as they left. Upon returning to San Francisco the word spread that the ''Glarus'' had seen a ghost, and she has not seen the sea since.

===="The Ghost in the Crosstrees"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	Cyrus Ryder wants to claim a new island, the Island of Paa, so he calls upon the Three Black Crows. It had previously been discovered by "Old Rosemary", but be had died while his title application was being processed. Ryder knows that great profit lies within the island in the form of [[Nitrate|nitrate beds]]. Another man named Petersen is also after the island, so he stresses the urgency to Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan. They agree to fix up the ''Idaho Loss'' to take on the mission.

:II.	Mr. Dixon, the story’s narrator, goes to visit the three men at the port in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where they are working on the boat. He stays over, and wakes up in the middle of the night to find Hardenberg staring at something in the air behind him.

:III.	Hardenberg tells Dixon of a moving figure in the [[crosstrees]] of the [[Mast (sailing)|foremast]]. They witness the figure raise the sails and then disappear. They decide not to tell the others in the morning, but it comes out when Ally Bazan asks why the sails are raised. Ally Bazan is scared, but the other three stand watch the next night and chase it off. The following night all four of them stand watch, but it does not return for three nights. They stop watching, and wake up to raised sails in the morning.

:IV.	The ghost only appears when Ally Bazan is not standing watch. Ally Bazan does not want to take the haunted boat to sea. Strokher falls ill, so the Three Crows decide to abort the mission. Two years later, Dixon and Ally Bazan are on a [[Waterfowl hunting|duck-hunting]] trip when the same figure appears. As it is hoisting the [[jib]] its face catches the light, and Dixon identifies Ally Bazan as the figure. He asks Ally Bazan if he [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalks]], but never brings up the ghost.

===="The Riding of Felipe"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	In the first section, entitled "Felipe", Felipe Arillaga leaves the home of Rubia Ytuerate, where he has lived for three months having an affair with Rubia. He misses his wife, Buelna Martiarena, but Rubia is furious and vows to curse the woman who Felipe next kisses. Felipe is superstitious and stops to confess at the [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]], but he runs into Buelna and her uncle, Old Martiarena. He kisses Buelna’s hand, but can offer no explanation when Old Martiarena demands to know why he won’t kiss her. Buelna rides away, leaving Felipe heartbroken.

:II.	The next section is called "Unzar". Felipe, after a month of misery from losing Buelna, stops for the night at Lopez Catala’s wine shop on a ride home from Monterey. Unzar Ytuerate arrives looking for Felipe, for he is Rubia’s brother and has been sent to kill him. The two begin fighting with knives.

:III.	In "Rubia", Felipe wakes up in a bed and the inn with bandages on his head and shoulder. Rubia is there, and she explains that a week after sending Unzar for him she realized her mistake. She professes her love for Felipe, but Felipe insists that he loves Buelna. Rubia kisses Felipe, besetting her curse upon herself. Unzar is dying, so Rubia rushes to his bedside. He yells at her for not standing by him after driving him into the fight, then he dies. Rubia repeats the words of her curse, realizing that it has come true.
 
:IV.	The final section, "Buelna", begins when Felipe stops at the Rancho Martiarena and demands to talk to Buelna. Rafael, the superintendent, tells him that she left for Santa Teresa that day and will become a nun at midnight. Felipe rushes away to try to stop her. The journey to Santa Teresa is long and Pepe, Felipe’s horse, struggles quite a bit towards the end. After many obstacles, they arrive just as Buelna is kneeling at the altar. They kiss in the middle of the church, and get married the following day. Two days later a beautiful woman drowns in a river near Lopez Catala’s wine shop.

==Critical reception==
:Critics felt that many of Norris' short stories lacked the substance and purpose that his novels possessed. Though short stories and essays, including this collection, were published after ''The Pit'', they did not affect Norris' reputation as he was viewed primarily as a novelist. Bixler notes, however, "the scattered reviews of these books were not flattering" (Bixler 119). Some stories were described as merely anecdotal, while stories like "The Ship That Saw a Ghost" were enjoyed for their "sensational value" (Dillingham 172). Franklin Walker describes "The Wife of Chino" as an "ineffective melodrama" (Walker 288).

==Other==
:Frank Norris preferred writing novels to short stories, but he understood that, once he had established himself as a successful American novelist, he would be able to sell short stories and articles to periodicals to make additional money. As a result, a number of his short stories were thrown together during times when he needed an additional income. Norries wrote "A Memorandum of Sudden Death", "A Bargain with Peg-Leg", and "The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock" so that he could afford to buy his wife, Jeanette Black, a Christmas present (Walker 286).

:A 1909 film directed by [[D.W. Griffith]], ''[[A Corner in Wheat]]'', was based on Norris' "A Deal in Wheat", along with his 1903 novel ''[[The Pit (Norris novel)|The Pit]]''.

'''''Alstonia boonei''''' is a very large, [[deciduous]], tropical-forest tree belonging to the dogbane family, i.e. [[Apocynaceae]]. It is native to tropical [[West Africa]], with a range extending into [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tanzania]]. Its common name in the English [[timber trade]] is '''cheese wood''', '''pattern wood''' or '''stool wood''' (see [[Ashanti Empire]] [[golden stool]]) while its common  name in the French timber trade is ''emien'' (derived from the vernacular of the [[Ivory Coast]]).

The wood is fine-grained, lending itself to detailed carving; the tree also finds many uses in [[folk medicine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Like many other members of the Apocynaceae (a family rich in toxic and medicinal species), ''A.&amp;nbsp;boonei'' contains [[alkaloid]]s and yields [[latex]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkhill H.M.

== Description ==
''Alstonia boonei'' is a tall forest tree, which can reach {{convert|45|m}} in height and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in girth, the [[Bole (botany)|bole]] being cylindrical and up to {{convert|27|m|abbr=on}} in height with high, narrow, deep-fluted buttresses. The leaves are borne in whorls at the nodes, the [[leaf shape]] is oblanceolate, with the apex rounded to [[acuminate]] and the lateral veins (see [[Leaf#Venation]]) prominent and almost at right angles to the [[midrib]]. The flowers are yellowish-white and borne in lax terminal [[cyme (botany)|cymes]]. The fruits are pendulous, paired, slender [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]] up to {{convert|16|cm}} long, containing seeds bearing a tuft of silky, brown floss at either end to allow [[anemochory|dispersal by the wind]]. The latex is white and abundant.

'''''Artibus Asiae''''' is a biannual [[academic journal]] specialising in the [[art]]s and [[archaeology]] of Asia. Along with the ''[[Ostasiatische Zeitschrift]]'' (founded in 1912) it was one of the most successful journals in its field in the German-speaking part of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See Walravens, Hartmut, ''Ostasiatische Zeitschrift (1912–1943), Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Ostasiatische Kunst (1926-1943): Bibliographie und Register'', Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 2000, XII.&lt;/ref&gt; The first number of ''Artibus Asiae'' appeared in 1925. While earlier issues contained articles in German, French and English, today's contributions are mainly in English. ''Artibus Asiae'' is owned and published by the [[Museum Rietberg]] in [[Zurich]]. ''Artibus Asiae'' also published occasional monographs since 1937.

== History ==
The first volume of the journal was published by the Avalun-Verlag Hellerau-Dresden in 1925 and was edited by Carl Hentze (1883–1975) and Alfred Salmony (1890–1958).&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Salmony see Walravens, Hartmut, "Salmony, Alfred". In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'', Band 22, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin, 2005, 386-387. Salmonys editorial role is also mentioned in Li, Weijia, ''China und China-Erfahrung in Leben und Werk von Anna Seghers'', Lang Verlag, Bern, 2010, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The early volumes appeared in four issues each, up to vol. 59. All subsequent volumes were published in two parts. 

The typographer, publisher and later [[editor-in-chief]] Richard Hadl (1876–1944) had worked for the [[Leipzig]]-based publisher ''Drugulin'' as a director since 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''Artibus Asiae'', 1945 (vol. 8 no. 1), pp. i–iii.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drugulin'' was one of the leading publishing houses and known for their wide array of unusual typesets. Hadl established his own publishing house, "Offizin Richard Hadl", in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The first book in his publishing house was "Schriftproben der Offizin Richard Hadl", Berlin, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and published five volumes of the journal ''Artibus Asiae''.&lt;ref&gt;"Artibus Asiae" vol. 3, no. 2-3 (1928–1929) was still published by the Avalun-Verlag, but already printed by the Offizin Richard Hadl. From vol. 3, no. 4 through vol. 8, no. 1, Hadl acted as editor-in-chief in Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] all publishing activities were moved to [[Switzerland]] and the journal would only appear irregularly.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 7 appeared in 1937, Volume 8 no. 1 was published in 1940 and Volume 8 no. 2-4 only in 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Vol. 8 no. 1 was the first issue to be published in Switzerland, printed by the ''Kommissionsverlag Braus Riggenbach'' in [[Basel]]. All further volumes were published by ''Artibus Asiae'' in Ascona, where Hadl and his co-worker and publisher, Luise C. Tarabori-Flesch from [[Trier]] had settled in 1938/39. After Hadl had died in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;For Hadl's obituary see ''Artibus Asiae'', 1945 (vol. 8 no. 1), pp. i–iii&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Flesch kept the journal afloat on her own until 1946, when Alfred Salmony became editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Waterbury, Florence, "Alfred Salmony: 1890-1958", in: ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', 1958 (vol. 12), 9. Lawton, Thomas, "Artibus Asiae Seventieth Anniversary," in: ''Artibus Asiae'', 1995 (vol. 55, no. 1-2), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Salmony edited the journal until his death in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries include https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/obituaries/alexander-soper-88-historian-of-asian-art.html; [[Gustav Ecke|Ecke, Gustav]], "In Memoriam Alfred Salmony", in: ''Ars Orientalis'' 1961 (vol. 4), 453; "Alfred Salmony (1890–1958)", in: ''College Art Journal'', 1958 (vol. 18, no. 1), 77 and Waterbury, Florence, in: ''Asian Perspectives'', 1958 (vol. 2 no. 1), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Artibus Asiae'''s link to the current owner, the [[Museum Rietberg]], was established through the museums's former director [[Elsy Leuzinger]], who edited an issue (vol. 20 no. 1, 1957) to commemorate the founding donor of the Museum Rietberg, [[Eduard von der Heydt]].&lt;ref&gt;An issue for von der Heydt's 70st{{Clarify|date=October 2013|reason=Should this be '70th', '71st' or something else? Subtraction from his birth date makes '80th' seem most likely.}} birthday was published in 1962 (vol. 25 no. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 (from vol. 46 on), the [[Arthur M. Sackler]] Foundation started to sponsor the journal. The [[Museum Rietberg]] was granted a special publication endowment in 1991 (vol. 51) and it henceforth became the owner of both the journal and the monograph series.

== Artibus Asiae monographs ==
Longer articles submitted to ''Artibus Asiae'' were often split into parts and published in several numbers of the journal. ''Artibus Asiae'' started to publish monographs on selected topics in 1937 to allow more lengthy contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of published monographs, see http://www.artibusasiae.com/monographs/&lt;/ref&gt; They are conceived as a supplemental series to the journal and present a broad range of lavishly illustrated studies.  Early monographs were on topics only remotely related to the arts, such as publications on the Tibetan grammar books Sum cu pa and Rtags kyi ‘ajug&lt;ref&gt;Rol Pai Rdo Rje; Johannes Schubert, ''Tibetische Nationalgrammatik: Das Sum cu pa und Rtags kyi ‘ajug pa'', Artibus Asiae Supplementum vol. 1, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; or on Chinese literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Eberhard, ''Die Chinesische Novelle des 17.-19. Jahrhunderts: Eine Soziologische Untersuchung'', Artibus Asiae Supplementum vol. 9, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

==Definition==
In the context of [[abstract algebra]], a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An '''automorphism''' is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]] of an object with itself. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).

The [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.

The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of "mathematical object" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an "isomorphism" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.

In category theory, an '''automorphism''' is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e., a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

==Automorphism group==
If the automorphisms of an object {{var|X}} form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of {{var|X}}.
;[[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: Composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism.
;[[Associativity]]: It is part of the definition of a category that composition of morphisms is associative.
;[[Identity element|Identity]]: The identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which is an automorphism.
;[[Inverse element|Inverses]]: By definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.

==Examples==
* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set ''X'' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.
* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.
* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.&lt;ref name=Pahl&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&amp;pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=§7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translation |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3-540-67995-2 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').
* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many "wild" automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 |date=May 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Lounesto |first=Pertti |year=2001 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |title=Clifford Algebras and Spinors | edition = 2nd |pages= 22–23|isbn=0-521-00551-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.
* The automorphism group of the [[quaternion]]s ('''H''') as a ring are the inner automorphisms, by the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]]: maps of the form {{nowrap|''a'' ↦ ''bab''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{refn|{{citation|year=2003|title=Handbook of algebra|volume=3|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|page=453}}}}. This group is [[Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation|isomorphic]] to [[SO(3)]], the group of rotations in 3-dimensional space.
* The automorphism group of the [[octonions]] ('''O''') is the exceptional Lie group [[G2_(mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].
* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.
* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:
** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].
** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.
** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').
** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.

==History==
One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[icosian calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;blockquote&gt;so that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by relations of perfect reciprocity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inner and outer automorphisms==
{{main article|Inner automorphism|Outer automorphism group}}
In some categories—notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called "inner" and "outer" automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation {{nowrap|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''G'' → ''G''}} given by {{nowrap|1=''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') = ''aga''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''); this is called [[Goursat's lemma]].

The other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] {{nowrap|Aut(''G'') / Inn(''G'')}} is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the [[cosets]] that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

'''Buried Alive''' is an art and lecture performance series by art-tech group [[monochrom]]. The basic concept is to offer willing participants the opportunity of being buried alive in a real coffin underground for fifteen to twenty minutes. As a framework program, monochrom offers lectures about the history of the science of determining death and the medical cultural history of [[premature burial]].
The series has created controversy&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/02/06/alarm_raised_over_burial_performance.html Toronto Star: "Alarm raised over burial performance"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/wa/ll/bild-de/unangemeldet-42925516.bild.html Bild.de: "Im TV-Duell gegen Klaas: Joko lässt sich lebendig begraben", 5 January 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; in some places it has been staged.

monochrom's founder and conceptualist [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] states that the performance series wants to start a conversation about death, culture, medical and scientific myths and mass media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/experiences/alive.htm monochrom's "Experience the Experience of Being Buried Alive"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grenzfurthner says that one of the inspirations for the performance series was the wish to deal with his claustrophobic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zebrabutter.net/der-film-glossary-of-broken-dreams-oder-im-schlachthaus-zum-goldenen-kalb.html Zebrabutter: "Der Film Glossary of Broken Dreams oder: Im Schlachthaus Zum Goldenen Kalb"; April 25, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Over the years the performance has attracted a lot of mainstream media coverage like the popular German TV show ''[[Joko gegen Klaas – Das Duell um die Welt|Joko gegen Klaas]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosieben.at/tv/joko-gegen-klaas/videos/15-joko-in-oesterreich-jokos-begraebnis-clip Pro7's Joko gegen Klaas – Das Duell um die Welt: "Joko in Österreich: Jokos Begräbnis"]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Pro7]] and the Austrian TV series ''Herr Ostrowski sucht das Glück''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernsehserien.de/herr-ostrowski-sucht-das-glueck/folgen/in-der-einsamkeit-797676 Herr Ostrowski sucht das Glück: "In der Einsamkeit"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freizeit.at/0414/michael-ostrowski-ueber-das-glueck/47.734.967 Freizeit: "Michael Ostroswki über das Glück", April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

==Experience the Experience of Being Buried Alive==

The first public burials were organized in 2005, 2006 and 2007 as part of a performance tour. People in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/downtown_news_6_20_05.jpg Downtown LA: "Goodbye Maestro, and Are You Experienced?", 20 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2005/07/05/monochrom-art-happen.html Boing Boing: "Monochrom art happenings in San Francisco, July 8-23", 5 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/georgiastraight-large.jpg The Georgia Strait: "Austrian artists play in the underworld", 14-21 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/nationalpost-large.jpg National Post: "Vienna's Gift To The City Of Vancouver: An Early Grave", 14 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2007/02/06/how_to_be_buried_alive.html Toronto Star: "How to be buried alive", Erin Kobayashi, 6 Februar 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2007/02/attend_your_own/ Torontoist: "Attend your own funeral", Pandora Syperek, 6 Februar 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; had the opportunity to be buried alive in a real coffin for fifteen minutes. No cell phones, lamps or other devices were allowed inside the coffin. Participants had to sign a damage waiver.
monochrom provided a 45 minute lecture about the history of premature burial and offered a set of different funeral marches and songs about death as "Death Jockeys".

==Six Feet Under Club==
[[File:Preparations for monochrom's "Six Feet Under Club" (2010).jpg|thumb|Preparations for monochrom's "Six Feet Under Club" (2010)]]
In 2010 monochrom updated the original concept and created the "Six Feet Under Club".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php sfist.com: "Want to Be Buried Alive With Your S.O. and Make Out With Them While Others Watch Via Webcam?", 2 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602083002/http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php |date=2 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/sex-love/article/20740921/the-six-feet-under-club-offers-sex-in-a-buried-coffin#.UfjcaG0deSo Daily Loaf, CL Tampa Bay: "The Six Feet Under Club offers sex in a buried coffin", 28 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/10/07/couples-have-sex-in-coffin-buried-in-dumpster-video SF Weekly: "Couples Have Sex In Coffin Buried In Dumpster ", 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is "extremely private and intimate". The coffin "is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding 'till death do us part'." However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. monochrom's performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/6fuc/RueMorgue--January2011-Page34_SixFeetUnderClub.pdf 'Dirty Deeds Done Six Feet Deep', in Rue Morgue, January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths "Six Feet Under Club takes Sex To New Depths", in 'Carnal Nation', 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213234425/http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance was repeated at the Viennese club ''Schwelle 7'' in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/heute-sarg-3.jpg Heute: "Sex im Sarg: Alle sind schon sehr erregt", 29 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/six-feet-club-art-project-burying-kinky-couples-alive/ Huck Magazine: "The Six Feet Under Club: an art project burying kinky couples alive", 31 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buried Alive (installation)==

Since 2011 monochrom offers a constant burial site at ''VSL Lindabrunn'' in Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meinbezirk.at/baden/lokales/guenther-friesinger-johannes-grenzfurthner-nora-zoglauer-im-sargdetails-die-kunstinstallation-buried-alive-ist-am-symposion-lindabrunn-auf-und-ausgestellt-beim-erntefestival-koennen-mutige-ausprobieren-wie-es-sich-anfuehlt-lebendig-begraben-zu-sein-m4779653,649540.html Mein Bezirk: "Kunstinstallation Buried Alive"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20150325_OTS0164/das-nahtod-erfahrungs-doppelfeature OTS: "Das Nahtod-Erfahrungs-Doppelfeature"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://esel.at/termin/77001 eSeL.at: "monochrom: Buried Alive Probeliegen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Saint Augustine''' is a [[Catholic]] church located in  [[Alcamo]], in the  [[province of Trapani]].

== History ==
In 1506 the Fathers of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] had already a [[friary]] in Alcamo opposite Porta Saccari (a town gate) near the present via San Nicolò. As they bore hard being subject to the [[Bishop]]’s authority, in 1589 they built another friary, together with the Church of Saint Augustine, in the same place where the Church is located now.&lt;ref name="catcon"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.236, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1650 the premises were still being constructed because the monks lived in great poverty of alms in kind  and finally, in 1660,  for the same reasons they left both the Church and the friary to the vescovile Curia;  since 1713 they  were administrated by the parish of [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]].
During the years 1849-1850 it was rebuilt in the rectangular shape, with chapels having [[pilasters]] and [[Corinthian (architecture)|corinthian]] capitals; then it was  restored several times, while the area where there was the friary was used for private residences. 

At present the [[parson]] of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]] is the Rector of this Church.&lt;ref name="catcon"/&gt;

In 1876 they founded the ''Pia Unione Femminile Gesù, Maria and Giuseppe'': its founder, the priest  Antonio Barbuscia Santoro,  was told by  his mother, when a boy, that during his birth (with death danger for both of them), he had been consecrated to the [[Holy Family]].
The parson of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]] gave this priest an altar with the image of the Holy Family.  As “good and evil inside families and society originated from woman’s good and bad behaviour”,  the scopes of this Congregation were:

*to put a stop to all the evils filling the town
*to honour [[Jesus]], Mary and [[saint Joseph]]
*give to its members every means more profitable for their [[sanctification]] and the moral and religious edification of their families.

== Works ==
The Church has 5 altars and one [[nave]] with a [[barrel vault]]; there are 24 built-in [[pillars]] with [[Corinthian capital]]s.

*High altar: [[Saint Augustine]], a painting made by an unknown author; until 1835 it was dedicated to Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]], with a painting on canvas made 1610 by [[Giuseppe Carrera]], now hosted in the  anti sacristy of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]].
*[[Brass]] [[Tabernacle]] in [[Gothic style]] and [[inlaying]]s (in the high altar &lt;ref name="catgui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p. 76-78-79, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the sides of the high altar there are a painting with saint Augustine and one with [[saint Monica]] on the right, and a painting with [[saint Rosalia]] and Our Lady of Dying People (Madonna degli Agonizzanti)&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt;
*First right chapel: [[Saint Nicholas]], [[wooden]] statue made by L. Santifaller 
*Second right chapel: a painting with the [[Holy Family]], dating back to the second half of the 19th century.

{{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'''''|鳥獣人物戯画||literally "Animal-person Caricatures"}}, commonly shortened to {{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-giga'''''|鳥獣戯画||literally "Animal Caricatures"}}, is a famous set of four [[Emakimono|picture scroll]]s, or ''emakimono'', belonging to [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. The ''Chōjū-giga'' scrolls are also referred to as '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals''''' and '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans''''' in English. Some think that [[Toba Sōjō]] created the scrolls; however, it seems clear from the style that more than one artist is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-to-left reading direction of ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is  traditional in East Asia, and is still common in Japan. ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is also credited as the oldest work of [[manga]]. The scrolls are now entrusted to the [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Tokyo National Museum]].

The scrolls are the earliest in a linear monochrome drawing style that was to continue in use in [[Japanese painting]] (as they are all done with the usual writing and painting brush, they count as painting).&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  

As opened, the first scroll illustrates [[anthropomorphic]] rabbits and monkeys bathing and getting ready for a ceremony, a monkey thief runs from animals with sticks and knocks over a frog from the lively ceremony. Further on, the rabbits and monkeys are playing and wrestling while another group of animals participate in a funeral and frog prays to Buddha as the scroll closes.

The scrolls were also adapted into several novels published by Geijutsuhiroba, the first book simply compiled the scrolls into one publication, now out of print. One of the books participated as part of the company's ''Fine Arts Log'' series as well as some were exclusive to certain exhibitions. Other companies like Misuzu Shobo and Shibundō also published books based on the ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' emakimono.

Although ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' is sometimes credited as the first manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ivanov| first=Boris| title=Vvedenie v iaponskuiu animatsiiu| publisher=Фонд развития кинематографии; РОФ «Эйзенштейновский центр исследований кинокультуры» |edition=2| location=Moscow| year=2001 |pages=11| isbn=5-901631-01-3|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some disputes with the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper. Seiki Hosokibara pointed to the ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' scrolls as the first manga, and [[Kanta Ishida]] explained that the scrolls should be treated as masterpieces in their own right.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

{{quote|The work belongs to the decline of the Fujiwara period, but it expresses in one of its best aspects the artistic spirit of their age. The artist is a delightful draughtsman. His pictures of animals disporting [themselves] in the garb of monks are alive with satirical fun. They are a true fruit of the native wit; they owe nothing to China beyond a vague debt to her older artistic tradition; and they bear witness to that reaction against the solemnities of Buddhist art which we have noticed.|[[George Bailey Sansom]]|quoted from ''Japan, A Short Cultural History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George Bailey |authorlink=George Bailey Sansom |title=Japan, A Short Cultural History  |edition=1st |year=1931 |publisher=C.E.

== Disputes ==
The ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper with Kanta Ishida discussed different theories of what really is the "first manga". [[Mangaka|Manga artist]], Seiki Hosokibara pointed to ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' as the first manga in history. Ishida said that the scrolls be treated as masterpieces in their own right, and not be cubby-holed as just the origin of manga and they have no connection with contemporary manga and the domestic works we are familiar with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Yomiuri'' Newspaper Discusses History's First Manga |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-01-03 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-01-03/yomiuri-first-manga |accessdate=2009-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Film|Cinema]] in Estonia''' is the [[film industry]] of the [[Republic of Estonia]]. The motion pictures have won international awards and each year new Estonian films are seen at film festivals around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/culture-a-science/estonian-film.html Estonian Film 100] Estonia.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==1896—1911==
The first "moving pictures" were screened in [[Tallinn]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiIpe99dL5MC&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Tom Masters; p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie theater was opened in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mY1pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;dq=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;ei=262zSMyPF5XIigH32_kj&amp;pgis=1 The Baltic States By Marje Jõeste, Küllo Arjakas] {{ISBN|978-5-89960-026-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; First local documentary was made in 1908 with the production of a [[newsreel]] about [[Sweden|Swedish]] King [[Gustav V of Sweden|Gustav V]]’s visit to [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einst.ee/publications/kultuur/cinema.html estonian culture - cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1912—1918==
The first Estonian documentary was created by [[Johannes Pääsuke]] in 1912 that was followed by a short film ''Karujaht Pärnumaal'' (Bear Hunt in Pärnumaa) in 1914. The first [[movie studio]] in Estonia, ''Estonia Film Tartus'' (The Tartu Studio of Estonia Film), was established by Johannes Pääsuke (1892–1918). Pääsuke produced documentaries, short films and pictures of Estonian nature for the [[Estonian National Museum]]. ''[[Karujaht Pärnumaal]]'' (Bear-Hunt in Pärnu County, 1914) was the first fictional short film made in Estonia. In total, eight films made by J. Pääsuke have survived and are stored at the [[Estonian Film Archives]].&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;[http://filmi.arhiiv.ee The Estonian Film Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1918—1940==
[[File:Konstatin Marska.jpg|thumb|[[Konstantin Märska]] at the [[Estonian Culture Film]] in 1936]]
The first full-length feature film was made in 1924 ''Shadow of the Past'' directed by [[Konstantin Märska]] and produced by his ''Konstantin Märska Filmiproduktsioon'' (Konstantin Märska Film Production). Two feature films by Märska have survived: ''Vigased pruudid'' (1929) and ''Jüri Rumm'' (1929). ''Theodor Lutsu Filmiproduktsioon'' (the Film Production of Theodor Luts Studio) was established by [[Theodor Luts]] and his wife [[Aksella Luts]], who produced documentaries and feature films. His ''[[Noored kotkad]]'' (Young Eagles) (1927) is generally regarded as the cornerstone of Estonian cinema. &lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;pg Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; Luts was also responsible for directing the only Estonian sound feature made before Soviet era, an Estonian-Finnish co-production ''Päikese lapsed'' (1932). Luts moved to Finland to work as a cinematographer immediately after finishing the film, and never returned to Estonia. Smaller film production studios in Estonia included ''Siirius Film'' and ''K.Kalamees Tartu''.

The major film production company after the [[Great Depression]] hit Estonia during the 1930s was state subsidized the [[Estonian Culture Film]] ({{lang-et|Eesti Kultuurfilm}}) that produced mostly documentaries.&lt;br/&gt;
In late 1930s, Academy Award nominated [[Miliza Korjus]] best known for a role in [[The Great Waltz (film)|''The Great Waltz'' (1938)]], daughter of an [[Estonia]]n [[lieutenant colonel]] in the Imperial Russian Army and later Chief of Staff to the War Minister of Estonia, had a successful career in Hollywood film industry&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Richard C. Frucht; p.95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Estonian animated short film ''[[Kutsu-Juku seiklusi]]'' was made in 1931.&lt;ref name="KJS"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212290/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940—1953==
During the first year of [[occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] (1940–1941) ''Eesti Kultuurfilm'' was taken over by the Communist Party and renamed ''Kinokroonika Eesti Stuudio'' (the Estonian Newsreel Studio). During the first decades of Soviet rule as Estonia became a part of USSR in 1944 after the end of World War II, filmmakers in Estonia were mostly coming from inner Soviet Union whose job was to create propaganda films that depicted the victory of socialism in a form of newsreels and documentaries.&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"/&gt;

Former Eesti Kultuurfilm was called ''Kinokroonika Tallinna Stuudio'' (The Tallinn Newsreel Studio) in 1942 during the [[Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] in World War II and ''Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (The Tallinn Film Studio) in 1947 again by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

During the era two feature films on Soviet themes were produced in Estonia directed by [[Gerbert Rappaport]], an [[Austrians|Austrian]] émigré in Soviet Union:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kontakt.erstebankgroup.net/events/2008-04_Filmmuseum+Wien_Rappaport/en Rappaport @ Filmmuseum in Wien]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elu tsitadellis (Life in the Citadel)'' in 1947, ''Valgus Koordis (Light in Koordi)'' in 1951 that was the first [[color motion picture film]] made in Estonia.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

==1953—1991==
After the death of Stalin in 1953 a more liberal period in Soviet Union's cultural policies followed. Filmmakers started to enjoy greater artistic control at the same time the Soviet State Committee for Cinematography ([[Goskino]]) in Moscow provided the money, state censorship body [[Glavlit]] and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Department of Culture had the control over releasing the movies.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

The Tallinn Film Studio was renamed ''Kunstiliste ja Kroonikafilmide Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (Tallinn Feature- and Newsreel Film Studio) in 1954 and in 1963 was renamed again [[Tallinnfilm]] &lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

Some of the first films produced during the era that were co directed by an Estonian [[Kaljo Kiisk]] were ''Juunikuu päevad'' (1957) and ''Vallatud kurvid'' also known as ''[[Opasniye Povoroty]]'', the first dramatic film shot in [[Kinopanorama]] (1959).

In the 1960s a story of [[Furst Gabriel or Last Days of the Pirita Monastery|Prince Gabriel]] by Estonian writer [[Eduard Bornhöhe]] was turned into a movie script by [[Arvo Valton]]. [[Grigori Kromanov]] was named to be the director of ''[[Viimne reliikvia]]'' (The Last Relic), released in 1969 by Tallinnfilm. The movie set the absolute box office record for the entire Soviet Union at the time by selling 44,9 million tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=loCDXm_Ar58C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Last+Relic+absolute+box+office&amp;sig=ACfU3U1PuHZmoYs8zDYWR1Yn5J2MuyIdTw Bridging the Cultural Divide By Sigrid Rieuwerts; p. 325]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065180/business Box office for Viimne reliikvia @ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; It was successfully distributed by the Soviet film export internationally in more than 60 countries. The film also influenced Estonian literature: 2 short stories listed for the [[Friedebert Tuglas]] award in 1970-75 included references to the Last Relic.

Another milestone in Estonian Cinema released in 1969 was [[Arvo Kruusement]]'s ''[[Spring (1969 film)|''Kevade'']]'' (Spring) based on [[Oskar Luts]] popular novel.&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt;

Successful films in the 1980s were ''[["Hukkunud Alpinisti" hotell]]'' (Dead Mountaineer's Hotel) by Kromanov and movies made by [[Kaljo Kiisk]] such as ''Nipernaadi'' (1983).

The most prominent female director [[Leida Laius]] who emerged during the era is best known for her ''Kõrboja peremees'' (1979) and ''Naerata ometi'' (1985) receiving at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] UNICEF Award in 1985. [[Peeter Simm]]'s best known Soviet era film is ''Ideaalmaastik'' (The Ideal Landscape) released in 1980. [[Peeter Urbla]]'s ''Ma pole turist, ma elan siin'' (I'm Not a Tourist, I'm Living Here) (1988).  [[Jaan Kolgerg]] emerged by the end of Soviet era with films ''See kadunud tee'' (1990) (The Lost Way) and ''Võlausaldajad'' (Creditors) (1992)

Among the leading Estonian film actors during the Soviet era were [[Rein Aren]] with about 30 roles, [[Jüri Järvet]] and [[Leonhard Merzin]].&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

==Since 1991==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union Estonia regained its independence, the cost of filmmaking skyrocketed and the 1990s showed decline in filmmaking that reached its bottom in 1996, the year when no [[fictional films]] and only 2 documentaries ''Lipule... güüsile... valvel!'' and ''Turvalisuse illusioon'' were made in Estonia.

In 1997, the [[Estonian Film Foundation]] was founded by the Estonian Ministry of Culture. Production of  ''Minu Leninid'' (All My Lenins) (1997) a parody of Soviet Revolution by [[Hardi Volmer]] marked a turnaround for Estonian feature films. In 1998, there were two feature films produced.  ''[[Georgica (film)|Georgica]]'' directed by Sulev Keedus won the ''FIPRESCI Prize'' at the [[Stockholm Film Festival]] in 1998 and the ''Prix Europa Special'' at [[Prix Europa]] in 1999.

Since then, the trend has also been towards joint film productions such as Peeter Simm's ''Head käed'' (Good Hands) (2001) a joint Estonian-Latvian coproduction that in 2002 won the ''Manfred Salzgeber Award'' at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and the ''Golden Olive Tree''
[[Lecce Festival of European Cinema]] in Italy. ''Kõrini'' (Fed Up) (2005) an Estonian-German coproduction. [[Arvo Iho]]' s  ''Karu süda'' (Hart of the Bear) (2001) nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the Moscow International Film Festival and for the ''European Film Award'' at [[European Film Awards]], was a coproduction between Estonia, Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic.

The most commercially successful Estonian film in 2002 was ''[[Names in Marble (film)|Nimed marmortahvlil]]''  (2002) (Names in Marble) by [[Elmo Nüganen]] and in 2003 a comedy by [[Rando Pettai]] ''Vanad ja kobedad saavad jalad alla'' (Made in Estonia) that in Estonia topped the international blockbuster ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' with its box office results.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

In 2004, two young directors emerged Jaak Kilmi and [[René Reinumägi]] with their ''[[Revolution of Pigs|Sigade revolutsioon]]''
(Revolution of Pigs) that won the ''Special Jury Prize'' and was nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the [[Moscow International Film Festival]], and for ''Grand Prix Asturias'' at the [[Gijón International Film Festival]].

In 2007, about 10 feature films were made in Estonia. Most notable perhaps ''Sügisball'' (2007) by Veiko Õunpuu receiving among other awards ''Best Director'' at the [[Thessaloniki Film Festival]], [[International Film Festival Bratislava]] and ''Venice Horizons Award'' at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Georg'' (2007) by Peeter Simm is a movie about the life of legendary Estonian singer [[Georg Ots]].

Most recent awarded film is Veiko Õunpuu's ''[[The Temptation of St. Tony]]'' (2009). In 2011, Estonia made eight full-length films, which included one animated film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-908215-01-7 |page= 111 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cinq-Mars' Farewell to Marie d'Entraigues''''' (French - ''Les Adieux de Cinq-Mars à Marie d'Entraigues'') or '''''The Kiss Goodbye''''' (''le Baiser du départ'') is a painting by [[Claude Jacquand]] in 1836, which is kept at the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]].

== History ==
[[Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars|Henri Coiffier de Ruzé d'Effiat]], Marquis of [[Cinq-Mars-la-Pile|Cinq-Mars]] (1620 - 1642), was a "[[favourite]]" of King [[Louis XIII]]. After plotting against [[Cardinal Richelieu]] he was tried and decapitated with his comrade [[François Auguste de Thou|de Thou]] in the [[Place des Terreaux]], [[Lyon]].

In 1826, [[Alfred de Vigny]] published a historical novel inspired by this event, entitled ''[[s:Cinq-Mars|Cinq-Mars ou Une conjuration sous Louis XIII]]'' (French: ''Cinq-Mars or A Spell on Louis XIII''), which piqued the interest of historical painters. In 1829, [[Paul Delaroche]] produced ''Richelieu et Cinq-Mars remontant le Rhône'' (''Richelieu and Cinq-Mars embark on the Rhône'') and in 1835 Claude Jacquand displayed a first work, ''Cinq-Mars et de Thou'', depicting the two men being led to their execution, in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. In 1836, Jacquand presented a new work to the Salon, initially entitled ''Le baiser du départ'', after the first chapter of de Vigny's novel.&lt;ref name=catMBA&gt;Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, ''L'Invention du Passé. Histoires de coeur et d'épée en Europe 1802-1850'' (Exhibition Catalogue), Paris: Hazan, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The composition is inspired by the famous balcony scene from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name=catMBA/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Jacquand continued his series of paintings on this theme with ''[[Cinq-Mars rendant son épée à Louis XIII]]'' (''Cinq-Mars Presents his Sword to Louis XIII'') and with two further works ''Cinq-Mars à Perpignan'' (''Cinq-Mars at Perpignan'') and ''Cinq-Mars allant au supplice'' (''Cinq-Mars Going to his Execution''), which were displayed in the Salon in 1837.&lt;ref name=catMBA/&gt;

The scene in ''Les Adieux de Cinq-Mars à Marie d'Entraigues'' was reproduced in a more serious form by [[Charles Vogt]] in 1853.&lt;ref name=catMBA/&gt;

In 2014, it was displayed at the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]] as part of the exhibition ''[[L'invention du Passé. Histoires de cœur et d'épée 1802-1850]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8092">'''COSMOS''' stands for "'''COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard'''", which sets certification requirements for [[Organic product|organic]] and [[Natural product|natural]] [[cosmetics]] products in the [[Europe]]. The standard is recognized globally by the [[cosmetic industry]]. By adhering to specific guidelines, cosmetics marketers can use COSMOS signatures, which are registered [[trademark]]s, on packaging to confirm the products meet minimum industry requirements to be considered organic or natural.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2002 five European organisations responsible for setting organic and natural cosmetics [[International standard|standard]]s met at a trade show to share ideas for broader standards to be used globally. These five COSMOS members are:

* BDIH (Germany)
* Cosmebio (France)
* [[Ecocert]] Greenlife SAS (France)
* ICEA (Italy)
* [[Soil Association]] (Great Britain)
Over 1,600 [[manufacturer]]s who sell over 25,000 products across over 45 countries follow the standard, according to Cosmos-standard.org. About 85% of the certified cosmetics industry uses COSMOS signatures on its products.

Although the five members differed on certain standards separately, they were able to smooth out differences to create a harmonised international standard that was first published in 2010. At this time the five members formed a non-profit international association overseeing the standard. In June 2010 the COSMOS-standard AISBL was awarded [[Royal Assent]] from [[Belgium#Politics|Belgian authorities]]. The documents published with the standard include:

* The Control Manual: describes how the control systems works
* The Labeling Rules: explains how to use COSMOS labels
* The Technical Guide: additional information&lt;ref name="The COSMOS-standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=The COSMOS-standard|url=https://cosmos-standard.org/the-cosmos-standard/|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS" /&gt;

==Certification and Labeling Process==

There are four main [[certification]] signatures that comprise the COSMOS-standard, which are for ORGANIC, NATURAL, COSMOS CERTIFIED and COSMOS APPROVED products. Here are six steps to gaining approval of product labeling within the certification process:

# The authorized COSMOS-standard certification body must first approve of the product specification. 
# 
# The applicant must submit their proposed product labeling to the certification body and await approval. Generic label designs for certain single-ingredient product are acceptable if the design is consistent for all products.
# 
# In the event the product specification is not approved first, the labeling can only get provisional approval.
# 
# Only after full approval of the labeling is granted by the certification body can the manufacturer print the labelling. The certification process must be completed before the labels can be used commercially. 
# 
# If the manufacturer needs to make changes to the product or labeling after gaining certification, they must notify the certification body and wait for written approval or a certificate update. Further approval from the certification body will be needed if the manufacturer makes changes to the organic percentage of the ingredients. The vendor will also have to make an amendment to the ingredients. 
# 
# Before the product can be launched, the labeling must be approved by the certification body and the product must be listed on the COSMOS-standard certificate. Printing labels without first getting approval can lead to certification withdrawal if the certification body determines the products and labels are non-compliant.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Cosmetics organic and natural standard Version 2.0 – 21st October 2013|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cosmos-standard-v2-21102013.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Technical"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Technical Guide Version 2.11 09/05/2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cosmos20technical20guide20v2-1120090517202.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Labeling Requirements==

Manufacturers and marketers are only allowed to use COSMOS terms and signatures for products authorized by the certification body. The certification body must be identified on product labels if it is not clearly mentioned anywhere else on the product. In cases in which the label size restricts product labeling, the certification body may allow flexibility as long as the product maintains the general principles of the Labeling Guide. The firm must at least mention the nature of the certification (such as organic or natural) and the identity of the certification body.&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Labelling Guide Version 2.4 – 28 June 2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/cosmos-standard20labelling20guide20v2-420280617.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Identification==

Marketers are allowed to use the COSMOS terms and signatures on company letterhead and websites under certain conditions. All the products of a brand must be certified organic in order for the company to make the claim they are "COSMOS ORGANIC certified." Otherwise, the firm must be clear that only specific products have been certified organic. In other words, the use of the terms and signatures must not be misleading to the consumer.

Essentially, the labelling must clearly and accurately describe the product, which must comply with the standard. The marketer must avoid listing ingredients or naming the product in a way that implies it contains certain ingredients that are not present. Any use or branding of the term "organic," for example, must comply with the organic standard and not be confusing to the consumer.

The [[labeling]] must not confuse the terms "organic" and "natural," which have separate definitions and certifications based on the way the products and ingredients are processed. If a brand sells several organic products and a few natural products, they must make it clear in their labeling and marketing the differences. The firm must also be clear if some of its products have no certification at all. In other words, in order for a company to promote itself as "COSMOS ORGANIC certified," its entire range of products must meet the organic standard and be certified.

Companies are not allowed to use [[logo]]s or seals that may mislead customers into believing the products are COSMOS certified.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling" /&gt;

'''''Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Above the Augustus Bridge''''' is an oil on canvas by the Italian urban landscape painter [[Bernardo Bellotto]]. Painted in 1747, it depicts the view of [[Dresden]] from the right bank of the [[River Elbe]], including the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], the [[Dresden Cathedral]], and the [[Augustus Bridge]]. One year later, he painted another piece titled ''[[Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Below the Augustus Bridge]]'', looking in the other direction from below the Augustus Bridge. Both of the paintings are in the permanent collection of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dresden vom rechten Elbufer oberhalb der Augustusbrücke|url=http://skd-online-collection.skd.museum/en/contents/showArtist?id=187372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dresden vom rechten Elbufer unterhalb der Augustusbrücke|url=http://skd-online-collection.skd.museum/de/contents/showArtist?id=135387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings have proved invaluable in rebuilding parts of the city that were destroyed during [[World War II]].

==Lists of replicas==

Between 1751 and 1753, Bellotto also executed smaller replicas of the two paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weber |first=Gregor |editor-last=Bowron |editor-first=Edgar |title=Bernardo Bellotto and the Capitals of Europe |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001 |pages=180 |chapter=Dresden, Pirna and Königstein |isbn=978-0300091816}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some other replicas from his own hand.

'''Experience architecture''' ('''XA''') is the art of articulating a clear [[user story]]/[[user journey|journey]] through an [[information architecture]], [[interaction design]] and [[experience design]] that an end user navigates across products and services offered by the client or as intended by the designer. This visual representation is intended not only to highlight the systems that the end user will touch and interact with, but also the key interactions that the user will have with interacting the internal systems or back end structure of an application. It provides a holistic view of the experience, vertical knowledge of industry, the systems, documenting, analysing and the points that should be focused on when developing a series of interactions that are intended to enhance end user’s emotions. The Experience architecture provides an overall direction for user experience actions across the projects.

==Experience architect==
An experience architect (also known as an XA) is a designer authoring, planning and designing the experience architecture deliverables.  An XA will encompass variety of interaction and digital design skills of human behaviour, [[user-centered design]] (UCD) and [[interaction design]]. This person is also responsible for connecting human emotions with the end product thus creating co-relations by ensuring that the experience meets or exceeds needs and objectives of the intended or wide users. The XA integrates the results into an actionable requirements. They are responsible for conceptualising and delivering the design deliverables that meets business and usability objectives by identifying the modules, templates, structure and evaluating the end product integration.

==Experience architect deliverables==
Experience architects are responsible for documenting and delivering a series of project manuals, guidelines and specifications. These include all or some of the below practices.
* [[Persona]]
* [[Scenario]]
* [[User story]]
* [[User journey]]
* [[Process flow diagram]]
* [[Information Architecture]]
* [[Website wireframe|Wireframe]]
** Ranging from High-Fidelity to Low-Fidelity
* [[Content strategy]]
* [[Prototype]]
* [[Functional specification]]

==Inclusive experience==
A great design experience must be self-explanatory and emphasizes on a user journey from step to step in minimalistic manner. In a broader term, it is a branch of [[inclusive design]] and [[universal design]]. The purpose of inclusion in the context of experience architecture is to create technology and user interfaces accessible for wider audiences inclusive of full range of human diversity with respect to ability, gender, age and other forms of human difference.

This methodology is to achieve independent experience and accessibility for users who are aging, abled or disabled or impaired either by birth, natural or incurred through natural events. It requires exercising and creating interfaces or prototyping a [[lower level design]] for physical world that makes actions and steps more self-explanatory thereby removing layers of prerequisite requirements to access any digital system. Inclusive Experience is an emerging and developing skill sets and standard elements in applications that are mass-produced for consumers, government and in other public domains.

== Education ==
The first Experience Architecture program began at Michigan State University. Developed by Liza Potts, Rebecca Tegtmeyer, Bill Hart-Davidson, this program launched in 2014.

The '''Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.''' (GVU, Society for the Prosecution of Copyright Infringement) is a registered association under German law. According to its own description it works for the [[Video game industry|game]] and [[film industry]] and helps to protect [[intellectual property]] and to counter the illegal distribution of [[Copyright infringement|copied materials]]. For this purpose, the association cooperates with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mpaa.org/about/around-the-world | title = Around the World | publisher = Motion Picture Association of America | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU was founded in the spring of 1984 and entered the register of associations in February 1985 for the first time. The headquarters were located first in [[Hamburg]], since 2008 they have been in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]]. The GVU became known to a wider public by participating in campaigns such as "pirates are criminals“ and investigations in the Kino.to case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = European Police Shut Down Internet Pirate Kino.to | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-police-shut-down-internet-196223 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-08-06 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ZentraleGVU.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Headquarters in Berlin (Quarter Mitte)]]

=== Early Years ===
Against the backdrop of a rapidly increasing demand for movies on [[VHS]] and an increase in [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] at the same time, film industry representatives agreed in early 1984 to set up a separate company to combat illegal distribution of [[copyright]]ed material. The decision was primarily driven by the motivation of the industry, to detach from the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The longtime chairman of the Bundesverband Audiovisuelle Medien (BVV, Federal Association of Audiovisual Media) and Managing Director of the German subsidiary of [[Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment]], Bodo Schwartz, was key in the establishment of GVU.

The establishment of the GVU as a [[Business entity|legally registered association]] was formally announced in the autumn of 1984 at the [[High fidelity|HiFi]] trade fair in Düsseldorf. The first constitution was adopted on December 17, 1984. It first entered the register of the city of Hamburg on February 27, 1985, finalising the establishment of the association on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.do?language=en | title = Common register portal of the German federal states | publisher = Amtsgericht Hagen | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to Bodo Schwartz, Paul Miller of the [[Cinema International Corporation]] (CIC) and Manfred Goller of the Verband der Filmverleiher (VDF, Association of Film Distributors) were members of the founding board.

=== Software Era ===

After exclusive funding of the GVU by the movie industry in its initial years, the organisations range of tasks expanded in 1997 to include [[PC game|computer games]]. On the one hand this was due to the parallels between illegal copies of films and games - both in the production and distribution - and on the other hand, the simpler distribution of unauthorized material over the emerging [[Internet]]. [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]’s membership of the GVU in 1997 initiated the membership of the entire Entertainment Software Association in the GVU in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807142341/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-07 |title=Milestones of our Work |publisher=GVU |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Microsoft]] entered the GVU as the first member of the [[software industry]], which represented a significant milestone for the work of the GVU and directed the attention of the general public to the association. Simultaneously, this resulted in an expansion of the range of GVU’s tasks. As early as in 2001, the GVU took over the [[Management|administration]] of the organization SAFE, which is responsible for the fight against [[copyright infringement]] in [[Switzerland]]. At the same time, cooperation intensified with the [[Austria]]n Verein für Anti-Piraterie (VAP, Association for Anti-Piracy) in the film and video industry, so the entire [[German language|German-speaking]] area was fully covered.

=== Management ===

The statutes of the GVU provides that the [[Vorstand|board]] consists of a chairman and at least three others. The GVU is represented jointly by at least two board members. Currently (as of November 2012) the committee includes Vincent de La Tour (Chairman), Dr. Holger Ensslin, Violetta Psofiou, Ralph Tübben, Alexander Skipis and Dr. Bernd Fakesch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130211040202/http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-11 |title=Imprint on the Official Website |publisher=GVU |language=German |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[List of company registers|Commercial Register]] there are committees for finance, legal and technology. Next to the executive board the association has a full-time [[general manager|executive director]] who is responsible for the daily operations and reports to the Board. Dr. Matthias Leonardy currently holds this position, who previously worked as a [[Syndic|general counsel]] for the German [[eBay]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225201307/http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-25 |title=Professional Profile of Matthias Leonardy |publisher=LinkedIn |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work and structure of the GVU was mainly characterized by Bodo Schwartz, who was on the executive board for over 20 years and led it as Chairman for a long time. He also represented the GVU to media and shaped the image of the association in the public, including through various interviews. Schwartz retired from his position of CEO of [[Twentieth Century Fox]] in 2002, and retired from the GVU in October 2006. His retirement speech in late January 2007 was held by [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech at the New Year Reception of the GVU | date = 2009-08-25 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German | publisher = FDP Bayern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

In 2011, a total of about 50 companies and organizations were represented as a member of the GVU. In the field of film this includes virtually all major [[Hollywood]] studios, such as [[Sony Pictures]], [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|Walt Disney Studios]]. Members from the gaming industry include [[Ubisoft]], Microsoft, [[Activision]], [[Konami]] and [[Koch Media]] as well as respective affiliates of the major film studios. In addition, in its Annual Report 2011, the service providers [[arvato]], [[Cinram]], [[OpSec]] and [[Rovi]] got quoted as members.&lt;ref name="report2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907051457/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Annual Report 2011 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special role is played by the membership of numerous [[Trade association|professional organizations]], in which the interests and positions of certain industries are bundled. So for example currently the [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] (BVMI, Federal Association of Music Industry), the [[Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien]] (BITKOM, German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media) and the [[Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware]] (BIU, Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) belong to the GVU. The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), one of the foremost organizations against [[copyright infringement]] in the [[English language|English speaking world]], is a full member too.

Overall, in 2011, nine organizations, 21 films- and 15 games providers and five other companies supported the GVU. Over the last five years the number of members has remained largely constant. However, as a result of the economic and [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]], the association lost some companies from the movie industry. The most prominent example in this case is the production and distribution company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which in 2007 was still listed as a member of the GVU, but no longer in the following year. MGM went into administration in 2010 and withdrew from other industry associations.

Since 2007, the GVU has published annually a list of its members.&lt;ref name="report2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812185131/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-12 |title=Annual Report 2007 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |language=German |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and [[business|companies]] indirectly involved in the GVU through third-party associations are not explicitly listed in it.

== Activities ==

The activities of the Association focuses on preventing economic losses of its members, resulting from unauthorized copying and its dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |title=Digital IP Theft: What it is, its Economics and Effects – and then, what? |author=Matthias Leonardy |publisher=5th Transatlantic Market Conference |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090428/http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU estimated the loss at several hundred million euros annually. In addition to those defined in the constitution, the association based its efforts primarily on copyright law.

=== Investigations ===

The association applies a large part of its resources to the actual detection of copyright infringements. The action is driven by the view that government agencies alone cannot monitor the entire [[Market (economics)|market]] for unlicensed content, which is why the GVU tries to fill this gap. The employees of the GVU, including former [[police officers]] and [[commissioners]], systematically scour the relevant sources of illegal copies, especially on the Internet. Unlike other organizations, by its own admission the GVU does not primarily aim at end-consumers, rather, it targets mainly the "big fishes". Besides those people who for example record a movie at the cinema or make copies from a computer game, these increasingly include the operators of so-called [[BitTorrent|Trackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German |url=http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531164334/http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-31 |title=Mission and Activities - Disseminating Illegal Copies |publisher=GVU |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU mainly focuses on large, internationally active [[Warez group|release groups]] where copyrighted products are reproduced and distributed systematically, especially for profit. In its work, the association - if possible - accesses to public registers, for example, to reveal the real people behind a [[Shell corporation|shell company]]. Due of their private-sector activity, the GVU may not identify IP addresses directly. Instead the association directs this as evidence to the relevant authorities. This is usually done as part of criminal procedure, which then leads to public prosecutorial investigations. Unless a criminal procedure is actually opened, an employee of the association often act as an [[expert witness]]. Not every [[complaint]] will automatically lead to a successful prosecution, for example the GVU had to make a total of three applications in the case of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87476-interview-gvu-war-bereits-dritte-strafantrag-gegen-kino-to.html | title = This was the third complaint against kino.to | publisher = Netzwelt | author = Markus Franz | date = 2011-07-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as it is known to date, the GVU does not claim [[damages]] from [[warez]] users according to civil law. Instead the association allows its members the freedom to make possible claims for losses incurred. However, the association engages in strongly communicating its legal opinion in individual cases. Particularly in cases related to so-called illegal [[streaming media|streaming]] of copied content, many legal assessments and opinions remain debatable.

=== Public Relations ===

In addition to its investigative activities the GVU does intensive public relations, which aims to raise awareness of copyright infringement. In the years 2009 to 2011 members of the association participated in nearly 100 events and reached about 2.000 participants through their [[Presentation|speeches]]. In addition, since the late 80s the GVU has offered seminars for police officers and prosecutors, where they can learn about the consequences of [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] as well as the activities of the association.

In 1990, the GVU launched a prevention program on the topic of [[holography]], a technology making it easier for [[retail]]ers and [[consumer]]s to identify unauthorized copied media. In addition, the association was known to a wider audience through the campaign "Pirates are criminals". This was produced by a subsidiary of the Central Association of German Film Theatres, where the GVU sits on the advisory board. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] an action of the umbrella organization MPAA was supported by [[Pelé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2006/06/10/mpaa_enlists_football_legend_pel_in_piracy_fight | title = MPAA enlists football legend Pelé in piracy fight | author = James Delahunty | publisher = AfterDawn | date = 2006-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the GVU has performed annually the so-called ROOF-industry forum together with VAP and SAFE, which recently took place in the Kalkscheune venue in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://irights.info/blog/arbeit2.0/2011/11/22/5-dach-branchenforum-gvu-verkundet-neue-strategie-vielleicht/ | title = GVU announces new strategy - perhaps? | publisher = iRights | date = 2011-11-22 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, [[Jurist|lawyers]], representatives of the games and movie industries are brought together with trade associations and [[Advocacy group|other stakeholders]] under the slogan "prevention and education". In 2011, the study of digital content usage (short DCN study) received large attention, since it was the first to cover the specific uses of legal and illegal online content. The study was prepared by the GVU and the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (Federal Association of Music Industry) as well as the [[Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels]] (Association of German Book Trade).

=== Political Influence ===
Beside the main activities, GVU also gives advice to politicians and represents its interests there.&lt;ref name="report2011" /&gt; For example, the association - as well as others around the globe - requested a [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] warning. This should be presented to an Internet user as soon as it first wants to call a pirated copy, but this remains controversial in [[Germany]]. In the course of this particular position, the GVU criticized the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Justice]]. Furthermore, the association has complained for years that in case of copyright infringement there is a right of access to Internet service providers, but this would fail due to the lack of storage of communication data ("web problem").

The GVU also calls to execute the missing third basket of the reform of copyright law at last. Likewise, the trend towards trivialisation of copyright infringement by individual politicians criticized repeatedly, most recently in an article by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and [[Paul van Dyk]] in TIME.

== Proceedings ==

The investigations conducted by the association were influenced by [[Technological change|technological progress]] over the years: After the beginning of the 80s the fight against pirated VHS tapes were in the spotlight, many prosecutions in the 90s and the following years related to the distribution of movies and games via [[Peer-to-Peer|P2P networks]]. Since 2010 streaming has taken an increasingly larger space.&lt;ref name="report2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128005349/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-11-28 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of cases opened in the years 2007 to 2011 fell from 576 to 204. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that since 2008 many [[State's attorney|prosecutors]] have focused on those investigations in which more than 200 [[Reproduction|copies]] of a work were produced. The GVU in its own words has adopted this trend and focuses its investigative activities increasingly on major cases.

In addition to the operations that stern directly from GVU investigations, the association supports those proceedings initiated by the relevant legal authorities. In addition, each year several proceedings are officially reported, which were initiated jointly by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] and the GVU. About a quarter of all cases result in a [[Sentence (law)|verdict]] or penalty order.

=== Significant Cases ===

In recent years, the GVU has uncovered many release groups and other networks, some of which stand out because of their size or importance.  Especially if in the course of the investigation a [[Search and seizure|house search]] takes place, the respective cases and the activities of the association experienced increased media attention. Mentioned in the annual reports of the GVU important procedures include the following:

* In September 2007, 50 properties were searched simultaneously in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. The aim of the objective, which was launched by the GVU project "autumn storms", was primarily to obtain evidence. According to media reports, a total of 60 [[Personal computer|computers]] and 15 [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] were seized. The GVU itself evaluates the action a success, for example by "[[Keinohrhasen]]" was no unauthorized copy in circulation until 2007.&lt;ref name="report2007" /&gt;
* Also in the same year a person could be found who was responsible for the spread of so-called First seeding the first illegal version of "[[Spider-Man 3|Spiderman 3]]". The person was also senior member of a release group that was responsible for numerous other software [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]].
* In March 2008, a request by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] umbrella organization caused that the GVU has started investigations against the operator of an internet portal, that offered primarily latest films like "[[Rush Hour 3]]". In the course of the proceedings it became clear that behind the offer stood a broad network, which had connections to the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]]. Following a criminal complaint of the GVU the [[Frankfurt]] [[Kriminalpolizei|Criminal Police]] confiscated ten servers of the group, which were hosted there in one [[data center|datacenter]].&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230033113/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-30 |title=Annual Report 2008 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earlier this year, the GVU acted against a Payserver-ring that gave users access to pirated copies for a fee. In this case 13 [[Byte|terabytes]] of data were provided for a total of more than 10,000 registered users. In addition the association led a criminal conduct against operators of so-called trackers in [[BitTorrent]] network.
* In the spring of 2009 this led to another spectacular lawsuit: After raids in [[Lüneburg]], [[Wolfenbüttel]] and [[Braunschweig]] three men were [[Detention (imprisonment)|arrested]], who ran a tracker with 24.500 copied movies, TV shows, games, audiobooks, [[eBook]]s, music and software. This was characterized particularly by the fact that every user had to pay a fee to access the tracker. In addition, extensive [[User guide|instructions]] were provided to make the access to pirate copies simply as possible for less experienced people too.&lt;ref name="report2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124112337/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-24 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual report also points to another important event: In 2005, the Swiss organization SAFE had received a notice of information about a large Payserver ring. Since the physical location was in [[Germany]], the persecution was handed over to the local association. The GVU set a criminal complaint against the head of the server in 2009.
* In March 2010, the GVU presented a criminal complaint, which was directed against a [[projectionist]] from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The projectionist was one of the most active Cinegroups and procured high-quality pirated audio material for the production of pirated copies. The investigations of the association revealed that they were identical to the original material even to the audio [[watermark]]ing. The group ended their activities completely after the arrest of the projectionist.&lt;ref name="report2010" /&gt;
* Another complaint in the same year was directed against the streaming hosting clickandload on which more than 20 terabytes of pirated copies were provided. According to the GVU-investigation the platform was organized as far-flung release group and, in particular, those who provided an illegally copy, shared revenue from [[advertising]] on the [[Website|site]]. During the police investigation the portal was completely shut down. Against the relevant uploader clickandload also proceedings were initiated.

In the following years, the association wants especially to tackle the financing of "piracy". The aim of the operation is to prevent professional service of ad-funded websites with pirated works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130206185156/http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-06 |title=In 2013, the GVU focuses on Financing of Piracy |publisher=GVU |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2012-12-06 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Kino.to ===
[[File:KinoToScreenshot.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Message from the Criminal Police]]

The most important proceeding of the GVU in the last decade was against Kino.to. In June 2011 Kino.to was one of the 50 most visited sites in Germany and was thus well known to the general public. According to the film industry over 96 per cent of visitors were located in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. At Kino.to it was possible to view tens of thousands of videos via so-called Streams, including numerous high-quality [[Movie theater|movies]] and [[Television program|TV series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/229865/article.html | title = Police Shut Down German Movie-streaming Portal | author = Jeremy Kirk | publisher = PCWorld | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Kino.to has become available in March 2008, the GVU was determined to go against its backers. According to the GVU, the process was difficult, as those behind Kino.to had specifically concealed their [[Identity (social science)|identities]]. For example, the [[top-level domain]] [[.to]] was chosen, as the responsible authority in [[Tonga]] does not releases any information about the respective owners of domains. Only when the third formal complaint by the Association was reported to the authorities in Dresden on April 28, 2011, the desired outcome was achieved: In early June, in [[Police raid|raids]] across several [[Europe]]an countries, several persons were arrested who were directly involved in Kino.to - including the owner Dirk B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Police take down Kino.to in massive anti-piracy operation | url = http://www.techspot.com/news/44187-police-take-down-kinoto-in-massive-anti-piracy-operation.html | publisher = TechSpot | author = Emil Protalinski | date = 2011-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly responsible for the success was the Integrierte Ermittlungseinheit Sachsen (INES, Integrated Detection Unit Saxony). During the course of process Kino.to was shut down on the suspicion of the backers forming a criminal organization and copyright infringement on an industrial scale. A message relating to the criminal investigation is now found at Kino.to. What is seen in the film industry as a major success fuelled huge criticisms by the majority of Kino.to users.

As a direct result of the closure of Kino.to, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] started an attack on the [[Web server]] of the GVU, which finally led to an overload and failure of the website. In addition under the name KinoX.to a portal got created which is a direct descendant of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/german-piracy-site-kinoto-relaunches-210099 | title = German Piracy Site Kino.to Relaunches as KinoX.to | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU has now also initiated an investigation into this portal. In addition, the association and authorities are investigating the [[Online advertising|advertising]] and marketing of Kino.to and KinoX.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |title=Anonymous retaliates against Kino.to takedown |publisher=GigaOM |author=Janko Roettgers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203205442/http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malware ==

A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]], which had been discovered for the first time on 20 March 2012, used the [[logo]] of GVU without permission of the Association. It targets and infects PCs running Microsoft [[Windows XP]] or later versions and claims to have [[Ransomware|locked the PC]] on behalf of the GVU, as pirated content had been detected on it. In fact not a single file on the hard disk is checked; however the user is prompted to pay a fee in order to regain access to the computer. Usually, the requested amount is between 50 and 100 euros and is to be paid via [[paysafecard]] or (now defunct) [[Ukash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.2-spyware.com/remove-gvu-virus.html | title = Remove GVU Virus - Removal Instructions | publisher = 2Spyware | author = Ugnius Kiguolis | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous variants of the GVU Trojan are circulating purporting to be a program of the [[Federal Office for Information Security|Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik]] (BSI, Federal Office for Information Security) or the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte]] (GEMA, Society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights). Due to the widespread use of the Trojan, in August 2012 the GVU released its first statement regarding the [[malware]], aimed in particular at the malware authors. It was speculated that the Trojan was written by operators of illegal streaming portals in order to open up new financial sources. The page KinoX.to which strongly resembles Kino.to was used for the mass dissemination of new variants of the malware according to GVU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |title=What Kinox has to do with the GVU Trojans? |publisher=GVU Blog |author=Christine Ehlers |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817122054/http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In January 2006 the GVU was itself under investigation. The state prosecution of [[Ellwangen]] accused the association of having promoted the illegal distribution of copyrighted material. As the accusation details the association had allegedly had financial dealings with an administrator of the so-called IOH server, over which numerous release groups had collected and distributed copied content. In addition, the association got accused of directly providing hardware for the operation of the server.

During the course of the investigation the business premises of the GVU in Hamburg, as well as the [[apartment|home]] of a senior employee, were searched. The GVU has officially confirmed the raid and, according to the authorities, made available all of the information. Due to the particular urgency of the case, the action gained widespread media attention. However, suspicions against the association have not been confirmed. The investigation has since halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onlinekosten.de/news/artikel/19848/0/Razzia-Ermittlungen-gegen-die-GVU | title = Roundup: Investigation of the GVU | language = German | publisher = Onlinekosten | author = Volker Briegleb | date = 2006-01-24 | accessdate = 2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, during another investigation, the role of the GVU was criticised: The [[Kiel]] District Court said that during the course of proceedings against a suspected software pirates, it is essential to ensure the independence of police investigative work. Specifically, there were complaints that an employee of the GVU had worked as an expert in the process and at the same time had a free hand in the analysis of seized computers. The requirement of impartiality, not only for [[judge]]s but also for prosecutors and the [[police]] had, in their opinion, not been fully safeguarded. Investigating authorities were prohibited to privatize their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |title=Official Website of the Kiel District Court |publisher=Schleswig-Holstein |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201081913/http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the strategy of the GVU in luring software pirates through a so-called [[Honeypot (computing)|honey pot]] trap has remained a subject of criticism. For example, during the course a raid in autumn 2007 suspicions were raised that the GVU and other organizations had installed open [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP servers]] on network, intended for the use by release groups, thus enabling the determination release group members based on their [[IP address]]. According to the unanimous opinion of experts, this approach is, at least legally, unobjectionable.

Individual media outlets have criticised the GVU’s close proximity to [[lawyer]]s, prosecutors, police and internet [[service provider]]s, although naturally these kind of co-operations are part of the work of any interest group. The Association’s close cooperation with various other organizations is repeatedly criticized, especially during its annual Industry Forum.

In August 2010, the GVU was suspected of having caused the unjustified removal of several posts on the video platform [[Vimeo]], which had been published under a [[Creative Commons]] license and are therefore available to all. Among other contents, "You are a terrorist" and "Electric Reporter" were affected. During the course of the investigation into the case it was revealed that the removal of the content was not initiated by the association, but by the company OpSec Security, based in [[Munich]]. The authors Alexander Lehmann and Mario Sixtus were able to obtain an injunction against the company and the GVU has since explicitly distanced itself from the company. According to the GVU, OpSec Security had at no point been contracted to clear videos from Vimeo in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-failure-takes-down-creative-commons-video-100812/ | title = Anti-Piracy Failure Takes Down Creative Commons Videos | publisher = TorrentFreak | date = 2010-08-12 | accessdate = 2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Helen of Troy''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] depicting [[Helen of Troy]]; it was commissioned by [[William Imrie]] of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cherry, ''Painting Women: Victorian Women Artists'' (1993) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositionally, the painting is similar to De Morgan's ''Flora'' and ''Cassandra'':&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2002, pp. 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Helena is standing upright and tall, in a peaceful posture that reminds to Boticcelli's representations of Greek and Roman goddesses (such as [[Pallas and the Centaur|Athena]] or [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Venus]]) that are, at the same time, an evocation of classical art, a usual characteristic between Renaissance artists. Helena has been removed from the common artistic elements of the [[Trojan War]]: despite dealing with a typically bellic topic, De Morgan decides to paint, instead of weapons and battles, the wonderful pink clothes and the fascinated look that Helena puts on the mirror that is reflecting her beautiful face, elements that can be read as symbols of her inconscient vanity, which eventually brought a long and terrible war and destruction to the city of [[Troy]], which we can see in the last term of the composition, on top of a hill. The presence of the moon-sun in the sky is also related to her feminine and voluble nature.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Innovation''' can be simply defined as a "new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation |title= Innovation  |publisher= Merriam-Webster |website= Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better [[problem solving | solutions]] that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing[[market (economics) | market]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maranville, S.|title=Entrepreneurship in the Business Curriculum|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=68|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/08832323.1992.10117582|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective [[product (business)|product]]s, [[Procedure (term)|processes]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, [[technologies]], or [[business model]]s that are made available to [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[government]]s and [[society]]. The term "innovation" can be defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.hitech.2009.02.002|title=Questioning two myths in innovation literature|journal=The Journal of High Technology Management Research|volume=20|pages=40–51|year=2009|last1=Frankelius|first1=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, [[invention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation-2012-4 | title = This Is The Difference Between 'Invention' And 'Innovation' | first = Kim | last = Bhasin | date = 2012-04-02 | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/09/10/whats-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation/ | title=What's the Difference Between Invention and Innovation?|publisher=Forbes|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often{{quantify|date=April 2018}} manifests itself via the [[engineering]] process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is [[exnovation]].

Pronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. 

While a novel device is often described{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as an innovation, in economics, [[management science]], and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In [[industrial economics]], innovations are created and found{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} empirically from services to meet growing [[consumer]] [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/general/34749412.pdf Growth in Services].

==Definition==
A 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the [[software industry]] defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which  builds on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] manual's definition:&lt;ref name="Henry2014"&gt;Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R. (2014). [http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf Towards innovation measurement in the software industry]. ''Journal of Systems and Software'' 86(5), 1390–407.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Innovation is production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and the establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.}}

According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation in American Government: Challenges, Opportunities, and Dilemmas|last=|first=|publisher=Brookings Inst Pr|isbn=9780815703587|location=|pages=|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of [[novelty (patent)]] (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor [[product-service system]] innovation).&lt;ref name="Henry2014" /&gt; In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:{{quote|Workplace creativity concerns the cognitive and behavioral processes applied when attempting to generate novel ideas. Workplace innovation concerns the processes applied when attempting to implement new ideas. Specifically, innovation involves some combination of problem/opportunity identification, the introduction, adoption or modification of new ideas germane to organizational needs, the promotion of these ideas, and the practical implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.

==Inter-disciplinary views==

===Business and economics===
{{main|innovation economics}}
In [[commerce|business]] and in [[economics]], innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in [[transportation]] and [[communications]] over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of [[factor endowment]]s and [[comparative advantage]] which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's [[globalization|global economy]]. Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of [[innovation economics]], argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that "[[creative destruction]] is the essential fact about [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=capsocdem&gt;{{cite book | author = Schumpeter, J. A. | authorlink = Joseph Schumpeter | year = 1943 | title = Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy | publisher = Routledge | edition = 6 | pages = 81–84 | isbn = 978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entrepreneur]]s continuously look for better ways to satisfy their [[consumer demand|consumer base]] with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, P., Boettke, P. J., and Prychitko, D. L. (2010). ''The Economic Way of Thinking''. Prentice Hall, 12th ed. pp. 163, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of [[Silicon Valley]] startups out of the [[Stanford Industrial Park]]. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of [[Shockley Semiconductor]], the company of [[Nobel laureate]] and co-inventor of the [[transistor]] [[William Shockley]], left to form an independent firm, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous [[startup company|startup-company]] explosion of [[information technology|information-technology]] firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.netvalley.com/svhistory.html |title= Silicon Valley History &amp; Future |website= Netvalley.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar [[metonym]]s, including [[Silicon Alley]] encompassing [[New York City]].

Another example involves [[business incubator]]s – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other [[Government Excellence Centre]]s – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in [[efficiency]], [[productivity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], and [[market share]]. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02529.x|title=Benefiting from Public Sector Innovation: The Moderating Role of Customer and Learning Orientation|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=550–559|year=2012|last1=Salge|first1=Torsten Oliver|last2=Vera|first2=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00951|title=Sparkling Fountains or Stagnant Ponds: An Integrative Model of Creativity and Innovation Implementation in Work Groups|journal=Applied Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=355–387|year=2002|last1=West|first1=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Drucker]] wrote:
{{quote|Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship, whether in an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen. It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth. –Drucker&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Discipline of Innovation |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |url= http://hbr.org/2002/08/the-discipline-of-innovation/ar/1 |date=August 2002 |access-date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Clayton Christensen, [[disruptive innovation]] is the key to future success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christensen, Clayton &amp; Overdorf, Michael|year=2000|title=Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change|url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''MIT Sloan Management Review'' Spring 2002. "How to identify and build New Businesses"&lt;/ref&gt; The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Scott D.; Johnson, Mark W.; Sinfield, Joseph V.; Altman, Elizabeth J. (2008). ''Innovator's Guide to Growth''. "Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work". Harvard Business School Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59139-846-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While disruptive innovation will typically "attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,"&lt;ref name=hbr201701/&gt; foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business [[operating model]]s as entirely new business models [[emergence|emerge]] over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of [[technological change|technological]] and [[institution]]al change that gain momentum more slowly.&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;

All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19104264|year=2009|last1=Salge|first1=T. O.|title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance: Evidence from English public acute care|journal=Health Care Management Review|volume=34|issue=1|pages=54–67|last2=Vera|first2=A.|doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, former Mayor [[Martin O’Malley]] pushed the [[City of Baltimore]] to use [[CitiStat]], a [[Performance measurement|performance-measurement]] data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of [[pothole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, T. and Rushing R. (2007). [https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/reports/2007/04/23/2911/the-citistat-model-how-data-driven-government-can-increase-efficiency-and-effectiveness/ "The CitiStat Model: How Data-Driven Government Can Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness"]. ''Center for American Progress Report''. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[mass transit]] systems have innovated with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus fleets to [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of [[mobile data terminal]]s in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2007). "Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis 70: Mobile Data Terminals". pp. 1–5. [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_70.pdf TCRP (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other innovative strategies include [[hospital]]s digitizing medical information in [[electronic medical records]]. For example, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[HOPE VI]] initiatives turned severely distressed [[public housing]] in urban areas into [[Urban renewal|revitalized]], mixed-income environments; the [[Harlem Children’s Zone]] used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Brownfield regulation and development|brownfield grants]] facilitates turning over [[brownfield]]s for [[environmental protection]], [[Open space reserve|green spaces]], [[Community development|community]] and [[Commerce|commercial development]].

===Sources ===
There are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.

According to [[Peter F. Drucker]], the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.&lt;ref name=Drucker/&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|thumb|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]
In the simplest [[linear model of innovation]] the traditionally recognized source is ''manufacturer innovation''. This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&amp;D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&amp;D invested by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H. Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2015|title=The Achilles heel of a strong private knowledge sector: evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=80–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is ''end-user innovation''. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] economist [[Eric von Hippel]] has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, ''The Sources of Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |title=The Sources of Innovation |last=Von Hippel |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric von Hippel |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1988 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012160410/http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotics engineer [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] asserts that innovations require only three things:
# A recognized need,
# Competent people with relevant technology, and
# Financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Engelberger, J. F. (1982). "Robotics in practice: Future capabilities". ''Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.

The Kline [[chain-linked model]] of innovation&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). ''Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1'', March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) for "breakthrough innovations". R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and Warren, D. (2008) [https://www.brookings.edu/research/metropolicy-shaping-a-new-federal-partnership-for-a-metropolitan-nation/ ''MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation'']. Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report. pp. 4–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286542154 |title=Perspectives on Innovation and Technology Transfer |last=Dubickis, M. |first=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |publisher=[[ScienceDirect]] |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

[[Information technology]] and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq |publisher=Forbes India Magazine |title= New Trends in Innovation Management |website=Forbesindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the software tool company [[Atlassian]] conducts quarterly "ShipIt Days" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit |title=ShipIt Days |publisher=Atlassian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as [[Innovation Time Off]]). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in [[focus group]]s (user centred approach), work closely with so called [[lead users]] (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate [[Europe]]’s surface [[transportation]] system, employs such workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |title=U-STIR |publisher=U-stir.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918055455/http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this [[user innovation]], a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become [[entrepreneur]]s, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like [[open source]]. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I. (2002). ''Networks of Innovation''.

(2010). [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/innovativity-cooperative-learning-business-life-teaching-siltala ''Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching'']. PhD thesis. University of Turku.&lt;/ref&gt;

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523 Forget The 10,000-Hour Rule; Edison, Bezos, &amp; Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule]. Medium.com (2017-10-26). Retrieved on 2018-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the [[incandescent light bulb]] economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible [[electrical filament|filament]] designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]]. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to [[high-throughput screening]] to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of [[A/B testing]] is often used to help optimize the design of [[web site]]s and [[mobile app]]s.  This is used by major sites such as [[amazon.com]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;[https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed Why These Tech Companies Keep Running Thousands Of Failed Experiments].

===Goals and failures===
Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the [[business plan]], and to [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Competition (companies)|competitive positioning]]. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"&gt;Davila, T., Epstein, M. J., and Shelton, R. (2006). "Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It." Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved [[quality (business)|quality]], creation of new [[Market (economics)|market]]s, extension of the [[product (business)|product]] range, reduced [[labor cost]]s, improved [[production process]]es, reduced materials, reduced [[environmental damage]], replacement of [[product (business)|product]]s/[[Service (economics)|services]], reduced [[energy]] consumption, conformance to [[regulation]]s.&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"/&gt;

These goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.35.5.597|title=Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics|journal=Management Science|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–606|year=1989|last1=Khan|first1=Arshad M.|last2=Manopichetwattana|first2=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Sullivan, David |year=2002|title=Framework for Managing Development in the Networked Organisations|journal=Journal of Computers in Industry|volume= 47|issue=1|pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
[[File:InnovationLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{main|Diffusion of innovations}}

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher [[Gabriel Tarde]], who first plotted the S-shaped [[diffusion curve]]. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G.  (1903). ''The laws of imitation'' (E. Clews Parsons, Trans.). New York: H. Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
# First knowledge
# Forming an attitude
# A decision to adopt or reject
# Implementation and use
# Confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the '[[Sigmoid function|s-curve]]' or [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion curve]]. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have "product life" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an [[emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovation''. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of innovation|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fagerberg, Jan., Mowery, David C., Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=9780199264551|location=Oxford|oclc=56655392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Edison et al.&lt;ref name="Henry2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R.|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.013|url=http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf |title=Towards innovation measurement in the software industry|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1390–1407|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their review of literature on [[innovation management]] found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.&lt;ref name="Henry2013" /&gt;

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

===Organizational level===
The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around [[balanced scorecard]]s which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Davila, Tony; Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton (2006). ''Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It''. Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political level===
For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region [[competitive advantage]] through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The [[OECD]] Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the [[Oslo Manual]] complementary to the [[Frascati Manual]] from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European [[Community Innovation Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;OECD The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities. Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data. Oslo Manual. 2nd edition, DSTI, OECD / European Commission Eurostat, Paris 31 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU [[Lisbon Strategy]] has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |title=Industrial innovation – Enterprise and Industry |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125633/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level Down of Innovation in Silicon Valley ===
Innovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley|title=Why startups are leaving Silicon Valley|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the "science and technology mode" (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the "learning by doing, using and interacting mode" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative [[cost-effectiveness]] research is a form of [[price controls|price control]] which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19523121|pmc=2881450|year=2009|last1=Chalkidou|first1=K.|title=Comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based health policy: Experience from four countries|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=339–67|last2=Tunis|first2=S.|last3=Lopert|first3=R.|last4=Rochaix|first4=L.|last5=Sawicki|first5=P. T.|last6=Nasser|first6=M.|last7=Xerri|first7=B.|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords "truly significant" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roughead |first=E. |last2=Lopert |first2=R. |last3=Sansom |first3=L. |title=Prices for innovative pharmaceutical products that provide health gain: a comparison between Australia and the United States Value |journal=[[Health (journal)|Health]] |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=514–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00206.x |pmid=17970935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[value-based pricing]] has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=Payers Growing Influence on R&amp;D Decision Making |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue= 11|pages=876–78 |doi=10.1038/nrd2749 |pmid=18974741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Australian]] academic developed the case that national comparative [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] systems should be viewed as measuring "health innovation" as an [[evidence-based policy]] concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong [[anti-trust]] laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing [[pharmaceutical innovations]] are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the [[AUSFTA|Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T. |last2=Bai |first2=J. |last3=Nguyen |first3=D. |title=Impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement on Australian medicines regulation and prices |journal=[[Journal of Generic Medicines]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1057/jgm.2009.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faunce TA|title=Global intellectual property protection of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals: Challenges for bioethics and health law in B Bennett and G Tomossy|publisher=Globalization and Health Springer|date=2006|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|format=PDF|website=Law.anu.edu.au|accessdate=18 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414040804/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T.

===Rankings===
Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: [[high-tech]] companies, [[manufacturing]], [[patent]]s, [[post secondary education]], [[research and development]],  and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 [[Bloomberg Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/these-are-the-world-s-most-innovative-economies|title=These Are the World's Most Innovative Economies|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies may vary widely; for example the [[Global Innovation Index]] 2016 ranks [[Switzerland]] as number one wherein countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] do not even make the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/5509/die-10-innovativsten-laender-weltweit-nach-dem-global-innovation-index/|title=Infografik: Schweiz bleibt globaler Innovationsführer|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista Infografiken|publisher=Statista (In German)|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 2005 [[Jonathan Huebner]], a [[physicist]] working at the [[Pentagon Building|Pentagon]]'s [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Air Warfare Center]], argued on the basis of both U.S. [[patent]]s and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since.&lt;ref name=Huebner&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = J. | title = A possible declining trend for worldwide innovation | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.01.003 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 980–986 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050707/7inventor.htm|title=Science: Wanna be an inventor? Don't bother| last=Hayden|first=Thomas|date=7 July 2005|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, he asked "Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?"&lt;ref name=Huebner/&gt; In later comments to ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Robert|title=Entering a dark age of innovation|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7616-entering-a-dark-age-of-innovation.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=2 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smart]] criticized the claim and asserted that [[technological singularity]] researcher [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others showed a "clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration" when it came to innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smart | first1 = J. | title = Discussion of Huebner article | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.07.001 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 988–995 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing [[Second Life]] and [[eHarmony]] as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Jonathan|title=Response by the Authors|journal=[[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]]|volume=72|issue=8|pages=995–1000|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.008|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, Huebner's findings were confirmed in 2010 with [[U.S. Patent Office]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strumsky | first1 = D. | last2 = Lobo | first2 = J. | last3 = Tainter | first3 = J.

===Innovation and Development===
The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major [[international development]] actors such as [[DFID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/author/jonathan-wong-head-of-dfids-innovation-hub/ |title=Jonathan Wong, Head of DFID's Innovation Hub &amp;#124; DFID bloggers |website=Dfid.blog.gov.uk |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gates Foundation]]'s use of the [[Grand Challenge]] funding model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/10/Gates-Foundation-Grand-Challenges-Breakthrough-Science |title=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Grand Challenge Partners Commit to Innovation with New Investments in Breakthrough Science – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |website=Gatesfoundation.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USAID]]'s Global Development Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab |title=Global Development Lab &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/idin |title=International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) &amp;#124; D-Lab |website=D-lab.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in [[developing countries]], such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/global-innovation-fund |title=Global Innovation Fund International development funding |website=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Development Innovation Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdif-tz.org |title=Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) |website=Hdif-tz.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-dfid-announce-global-development-innovation-ventures |title=USAID and DFID Announce Global Development Innovation Ventures to Invest in Breakthrough Solutions to World Poverty &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Given the noticeable effects on [[efficiency]], [[quality of life]], and [[productivity|productive growth]], innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding [[Research and Development]] to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation [[performance measurement|performance metrics]], strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation [[economic development]] initiatives, especially to strengthen [[business cluster|regional clusters]]. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision [[manufacturing]], [[information technology]], and [[clean energy]], other areas of national concern would be tackled including [[government debt]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[oil dependence]].&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt; The U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDA_FY_2010_Annual_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Economic Development Administration : Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report |website=Eda.gov |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, federal grants in R&amp;D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[South Korea]], and [[Switzerland]] in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan areas]], the essential engines of the American economy.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt;

Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |title=Science and Technology |publisher=MEXT |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905171421/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/Ministry.php |title=BMBF " Ministry |publisher=Bmbf.de |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the [[Medvedev modernisation programme]] which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the [[Government of Western Australia]] has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. [[Landgate]] was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/innovation |title=Home  |publisher=Landgate Innovation Program |website=Landgate.wa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regions]] have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up [[regional innovation agency]] to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 [[Ruta N]] to transform the city into a knowledge city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ironclad''''' is a 2011 British action adventure [[war film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ironclad-v533401|work=Allmovie|title=Ironclad|accessdate=10 November 2012|author=Buchanan, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Jonathan English]]. Written by English and Erick Kastel, based on a screenplay by Stephen McDool, the cast includes [[James Purefoy]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Vladimir Kulich]], [[Mackenzie Crook]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Charles Dance]].&lt;ref name="SouthWalesEcho"/&gt; The film chronicles the [[First Barons' War|siege]] of [[Rochester Castle]] by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1215.&lt;ref name="SouthWalesEcho"/&gt; The film was shot entirely in [[Wales]] in 2009 and produced on a budget of $25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

==Plot==
A prologue describes how the barons of [[Kingdom of England|England]], aided by the [[Knights Templar]], fought against tyrannical [[John, King of England|King John]] in a [[First Barons' War|war]] that lasted more than three years. It ended with the King signing the [[Magna Carta]], a document granting rights to all English [[franklin (class)|freemen]].

King John regrets succumbing to the pressure of the barons to sign the Magna Carta.  Soon after, he hires an army of pagan [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] mercenaries under the leadership of a warlord, Captain Tiberius, to restore John's absolute authority over the kingdom, under the presumption that the [[Pope]] has agreed to keep Christian missionaries out of their lands in [[Denmark]].

The Abbot Marcus leads three Templar knights (who have taken vows of silence) on a pilgrimage to [[Canterbury]] and they take shelter from the rain at Darnay Castle. One of the knights, Thomas Marshall, is assured by the [[abbot]] that Marshall's release from the Templar Order will be sought at Canterbury. By morning, King John arrives at the castle with his army and mercenaries. Baron Darnay signed the Magna Carta and in retribution John orders him hanged. The Abbot attempts to intervene and the King orders that the abbot's tongue be cut off. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall escapes the castle on horseback carrying the abbot; the two knights left behind are slain. The abbot dies before night of his wound, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain.

Once he has reached [[Canterbury]], Marshall meets with [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop Langton]], the author of the Magna Carta, and Baron [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]], a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for writing the Magna Carta. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do so is [[Rochester Castle]], the seat of Baron Cornhill and a strategic stronghold that controls southern England and allows access to [[London]] and the rest of the country.

[[File:Rochester Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582414.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Rochester Castle]]]]
Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire, Guy, and a petty criminal named Jedediah, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] where, on arriving, they discover several Danish mercenaries have already claimed the [[Rochester Castle|castle]]; the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danes, and then claim Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Cornhill. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men leave if they wish; none accept.

A second assault sees the Danes' siege tower destroyed by a [[trebuchet]] crafted by the defenders from within the castle. John's forces then attempt to starve out the defenders. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off in haste to expedite affairs. As the season turns to winter, the hunger of the castle's occupants continue; Marshall leaves the castle under cover of night and then returns ahead of his pursuers with food stolen from the Danish camp. The castle morale is bolstered by Marshall's act and he gives in to the advances of Cornhill's young wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows.

The Danish leader, Tiberius, threatened by John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next attack and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos, d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armour and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep.

Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then hurled by the castle trebuchet into a [[keep]] wall. Cornhill tries to surrender but is stopped; he goes instead upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself. John's engineers have been preparing a mine under the keep's foundation, and they have a herd of pigs brought and put in the mine which is then stoked, set afire and the animal fat used to damage the keep's foundation, causing it to collapse; as the keep's walls come down, the final assault begins.

The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, the latter knocked unconscious by falling rubble. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed, until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after a long and savage duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and [[Kingdom of France|French]] army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England's new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that "We held".

The epilogue describes King John's death during his retreat and the reconstruction of [[Rochester Castle]], and how it, like the [[Magna Carta]], still stands.

==Production==
Actress [[Megan Fox]] was attached to the film when the film's production company, Mythic, began promoting it to investors at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]. Fox left the film and was later replaced by [[Kate Mara]]. Due to the decreased amount of credit and financing available in 2009, the budget of the film was reduced and the entire supporting cast was changed, with the exception of actors [[James Purefoy]] and [[Paul Giamatti]]. Producer Andrew Curtis described the financing of the film as "more complex than a [[Tube map|London Underground map]]" to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine; the film ended up crediting 18 executive producers.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dawtrey | first = Adam | date = 7 May 2010 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018859.html | title = 'Ironclad' overcomes finance obstacles | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Principal photography]] for the film began at [[Dragon International Film Studios]] near the village [[Llanharan]] in Wales on 9 October 2009. A replica of [[Rochester Castle]] was built on the studio complex.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Peter (13 October 2009).

==Fictional elements==
The film is only loosely based on reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/03/ironclad-review |title=Ironclad – review |first=Cath |last=Clarke |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]] commanded the garrison but contemporary chroniclers do not agree on how many men it consisted of. Estimates range from 95 to 140 knights supported by [[Crossbowman|crossbowmen]], sergeants, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Reginald Allen |title=Rochester Castle |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |year=1969 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; John did take the castle, most of the higher nobles being imprisoned or banished; and the French did not arrive in England until some six months after the siege had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of England|year=1826|publisher=Talboys and Wheeler, and William Pickering (orig. James S. Virtue)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63wBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|first=David |last=Hume|authorlink=David Hume|accessdate=22 August 2011|page=83|chapter=11|quote=he was content to sacrifice, in this barbarous manner, the inferior prisoners only. The captivity of William de Albiney, the best officer among the confederated barons, was an irreparable loss to their cause}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters departing significantly from the historical record include William d'Aubigny, who was not an ennobled wool merchant (nor was he tortured and killed in the siege).

[[File:Mapofrocheseterenglandfromfreemanswilliamrufus1882e.jpg|thumb|19th Century map of Medieval Rochester showing the proximity of the Castle, Cathedral and City]]
The closing narration explains that this was one of the first victories that the [[Kingdom of France|French]] had that would eventually lead to total victory. However, not mentioned in the narriation was that after John's death in 1216, many of the English rebels preferred a weak English King in the person of nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] over an experienced [[Louis VIII of France|French monarch]] and thus rallied around Henry. The rebellion was defeated by Royalist supporters in 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/king-john-and-french-invasion-england |title=King John and the French Invasion |first=Sean |last=McGlynn |publisher=BBC History |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the castle itself is depicted realistically, the nearby [[Rochester Cathedral|Norman Cathedral]] and the City of Rochester itself are completely missing from the location shots.  In reality the Cathedral is only a few hundred yards from the castle walls and Rochester has been a substantial settlement since [[Roman Britain|Roman times]].

The film's [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] are depicted as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-speaking]] [[Vikings|Viking]]-like pagans when [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Denmark had been Christianized]] by that time. Also, King John's mercenaries were mostly [[Flemish]], [[Provence|Provençal]]s and [[Aquitaine|Aquitainian]]s, not Danes.

Thomas Marshal, the main character played by [[James Purefoy]], is based loosely upon medieval knight and statesman [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]].

The movie has the Knights Templar as amongst the ringleaders in the battle against John Lackland. In reality the Templars and King John had a cordial relation and they were one of the few powerful groups in England which John did not offend or alienate during his reign, and the Order was amongst his financial backers providing him with the necessary funds to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Jones (writer)|Jones, Dan]], ''The Templars.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
''Ironclad'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many calling it a guilty pleasure. It currently holds 43% critical score on Rotten Tomatoes, alongside a 41% audience score.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ironclad/?search=ironclad IRONCLAD]&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis, writing from The New York Times criticized the film for its emphasis on violent action scenes above a cohesive plot, stating that " “Ironclad” alternately feels, plays and sounds like an abridged television mini-series and a feature-length video game," and that "the action is cluttered and the story overly compressed," but conceded that the film was enthusiastic in its pursuit of violence to entertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Grant a Few Rights, See What Happens?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/movies/ironclad-with-paul-giamatti-and-derek-jacobi-review.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
A sequel called, ''[[Ironclad: Battle for Blood]]'', was announced as in development shortly after the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/a-sequel-to-ironclad-is-in-the-works-for-some-reason-20120515&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by [[Jonathan English]] and set five years after the end of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filminserbia.com/Film-In-Serbia/313/Ironclad-Battle-for-Blood-2013.shtml Ironclad: Battle for Blood (2013)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205133953/http://www.filminserbia.com/Film-In-Serbia/313/Ironclad-Battle-for-Blood-2013.shtml |date=5 December 2013 }} at FilminSerbia.com&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013 a trailer was released,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYF0ObzRws IRONCLAD 2 Battle for Blood OFFICIAL TRAILER 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the film was released in March 2014. The sequel went on to receive deeply negative reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 17% and many critics condemning the film for intensifying the faults from its predecessor. Leslie Felperin from The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film for its decreased budget, less famous ensemble, and "sloppier" retelling of medieval history, but complimented the film on its musical score, stating that "Andreas Weidinger's orchestral score, featuring choral elements and plenty of brass, represents a redeeming feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felperin|first1=Leslie|title='Ironclad: Battle for Blood': Film Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ironclad-battle-blood-film-review-717930|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">'''John William Grout''' (July 25, 1843 – October 21, 1861) was an [[American Civil War]] soldier from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], whose death inspired the poem "The Vacant Chair".  

==Life and death==  
The son of Jonathan and Mary Jane Grout, John William Grout was born July 25, 1843, at Worcester, Massachusetts.  He was a graduate of [[Phillips Academy, Andover]] in 1859. 

He served as a 2nd lieutenant of Company D, [[15th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|15th Massachusetts Infantry]] and was killed at age eighteen at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff|Battle of Ball’s Bluff]]. Lt. Grout's body was recovered on November 5, 1861, after being washed 35 miles back to [[Washington, D.C.]] His remains were identified by the name written on his clothing.

==Poem==
His death inspired a famous poem that was later turned into a Civil War song. The poem ("The Vacant Chair") is an allegory that describes the pain suffered by the family of those killed in war when sitting at the [[Thanksgiving]] table. The poem was written by [[Henry S. Washburn]] and was turned into song by [[George F. Root]]. Root wrote "[[The Battle Cry of Freedom]]", "[[Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!]]" and other songs of the Civil War. "The Vacant Chair" was a hit in both the North and the South.

'''''La Revue musicale''''' was a music magazine founded by [[Henry Prunières]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=Duchesneau&gt;{{cite book|last=Duchesneau|first=Michel|title=La Revue musicale (1920–40) and the founding of a modern music|publisher=Université de Montréal|page=743|url=http://www.rilm.org/historiography/Duchesneau.pdf|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Revue musicale'' of Prunières was undoubtedly the first music publishing magazine giving as much attention to the quality of editing, iconography, and illustration. In each issue (11 per year), there was plenty of information on the musical and choreographic life in many countries.  

In addition to the magazine, there were over 160 musical pieces by various composers, most of whom were French, irregularly produced as 81 supplements between 1920 and 1939.  Many of these were composed specifically for the magazine.  Several compositions have been over-looked in listings of the complete works of the composer.  &lt;ref name=supplements&gt;{{cite book|last=Borucki|first=William|title=A Guide to the Musical Supplements of La Revue Musicale|publisher=Recital Publications|page=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's aim was to support the profound changes taking place in the music of the period while simultaneously showing affection for the music of the past. Avoiding intransigent nationalism that marked [[French classical music]] before the [[World War I]], the magazine became a reference point for a segment of [[European music]] through the interwar period.&lt;ref name=Lavoie&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavoie|first=Marie-Noëlle|title=Dance in Henry Prunières's La Revue musicale (1920–40): Between the early and the modern|publisher=Université de Montréal|page=761|url=http://www.rilm.org/historiography/lavoie.pdf|language=fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After 20 years of methodically building a new music firmly based on its adherence to [[Classicism]], the events of [[World War II]] made shut down the magazine in 1940.

The '''MacDowell Colony''' is an [[artists' colony]] in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], United States, founded in 1907 by [[Marian MacDowell]], pianist and wife of composer [[Edward MacDowell]]. She established the institution and its endowment chiefly with donated funds. She led the colony for almost 25 years, against a background of two world wars, the [[Great Depression]], and other challenges.

The mission of The MacDowell Colony is to nurture the arts by offering creative individuals of the highest talent an inspiring environment in which they can produce enduring works of the imagination.

Over the years, an estimated 7,700 artists have been supported in residence, including the winners of at least 79 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, 781 Guggenheim Fellowships, 100 Rome Prizes, 30 National Book Awards, 26 Tony Awards, 24 MacArthur Fellowships, 9 Grammys, 8 Oscars, and 8 National Medals for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macdowellcolony.org/about/faqs MacDowell Colony FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The colony has accepted visual and interdisciplinary artists, architects, filmmakers, composers, playwrights, poets, and writers, both well-known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7686354|title= Artists Retreat into Solitude at MacDowell Colony|author=Silverman, Art |work=All Things Considered|date= March 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The composer Edward MacDowell was one of the first seven members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He believed that interdisciplinary associations among artists were valuable.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1896, Marian MacDowell bought Hillcrest Farm in Peterborough, New Hampshire, as a summer residence for herself and her husband. She had always been careful to give him a quiet room for his work. Edward MacDowell found that the New Hampshire landscape enhanced his work of composing music.

The couple formulated a plan to provide an interdisciplinary experience in a nurturing landscape, by creating an institutionalized residential [[art colony]] in the area. In 1904, Edward MacDowell began to show signs of an illness that ended his composing and teaching career. He would die in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library Of Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200035715/default.html|website=Library Of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Marian MacDowell deeded their farm to the Edward MacDowell Association and founded the MacDowell Colony. The first guests arrived that year: sisters [[Helen Farnsworth Mears]], a sculptor, and Mary Mears, a writer. MacDowell began by inviting applicants personally, but by the 1920s had consigned the admission process to a committee.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Marian and friends raised funds among a wide variety of people for the colony, which was supported by industrialist and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], former [[U.S. President]] [[Grover Cleveland]], financier [[J. P. Morgan]], other prominent people, as well as many others across the country. MacDowell said the most consistent support came from women's clubs and professional music sororities (see, for example, the [[MacDowell Club]] of New York). At the age of 50, MacDowell began lecturing to women's groups to raise funds, resumed her performing career, and became a noted interpreter of her husband's work.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

By 1918, 31 of [[Isabelle Sprague Smith]]'s students funded the creation of the Isabelle D. Sprague Smith studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Musical Monitor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnpFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA357|year=1918|publisher=Mrs. David Allen Campbell, Publisher|page=357|chapter=Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years more separate studios were built. The program continues in 32 studios scattered over {{convert|450|acre|sqkm}} of land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Medal Day ==
{{main article |Edward MacDowell Medal}}
Every year, the colony presents the [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] to an artist who has made a significant cultural contribution. Residency at the colony is not a requirement. Medal Day is one of the rare occasions when the colony is open to the public. The ceremony includes a keynote speech, after which the artists open their studios to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.macdowellcolony.org/md.html| title=Medal Day| publisher=The MacDowell Colony| accessdate=2008-03-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407060154/http://www.macdowellcolony.org/md.html| archivedate=2008-04-07| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property-tax exemption dispute==
The colony, a [[non-profit organization]], enjoys the status of a [[charitable organization|charity]], entitling it to exemption from local [[property tax]]es, among other things. However, in 2005, the town of Peterborough's [[board of selectmen|selectmen]] (local-government executives) decided to challenge MacDowell's charitable status and billed the colony for a "payment in lieu of taxes". A lawyer for the town argued that "the colony certainly benefits its artists-in-residence, but that doesn't strike us as being the general public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Winkleman, E. |date=November 1, 2005|url=http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2005_11_01_archive.html| title= Local Government: McDowell Not Advancing Spiritual or Intellectual Well-Being of General Public| website=EdwardWinkleman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony's board of directors paid the bill, then successfully challenged the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Town Demands Taxes from Long-Exempt Artists' Colony| date=October 13, 2005| author=Brooks, Anthony (Author) &amp; Inskeep, Steve (Host)| work=All Things Considered| publisher=NPR| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4956854}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] opinion found that the MacDowell Colony, by promoting the arts, was a charitable institution, a ruling that was upheld by the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] in a subsequent appeal.&lt;ref name=supcourt&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2008/macdo024.pdf| title=Town of Peterborough v. The MacDowell Colony, Inc.| date=2008-03-14|format=PDF| publisher=The Supreme Court of New Hampshire| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p13}} The appeal court found that "Contrary to the Town's assertions, MacDowell's articles of incorporation oblige it to use its property for its stated charitable purpose."&lt;ref name=supcourt/&gt;{{rp|p11}}

[[File:Madonna della strada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original painting of ''Madonna Della Strada'', hanging in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome]]

'''''Madonna Della Strada''''' or '''''Santa Maria Della Strada''''' &amp;mdash; the [[Italian language|Italian]] for '''''Our Lady of the Wayside''''', or '''''Our Lady of the Good Road''''' &amp;mdash; is the name of an image of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], enshrined at the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome, [[mother church]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] [[religious order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and is a variation on the Eastern ''basilissa'' (imperial) type of icon.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

The ''Madonna Della Strada'' is the [[patron saint|patroness]] of the Society of Jesus. Its founder, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], was said to have been protected by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary during battle in his service as a  soldier.&lt;ref&gt; John W. O'Malley, et all 1999 ''The Jesuits'' University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|978-0-8020-4287-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name goes back to a shrine established in Rome in the 5th century by the Astalli family, originally known as the ''Madonna degli Astalli'', at a crossroads along the ceremonial route of the popes.&lt;ref name=Waldrop&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/issue/720/art/object-devotion Waldrop S.J., Gregory. "Object of Devotion", ''America'', December 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13th-14th century fresco (a wall painting done on damp plaster) was originally painted on the wall of Saint Mary of the Way in Rome, the church of  the  Society of Jesus (Jesuits), given to Saint Ignatius by Pope Paul III in 1540.&lt;ref name=Pauca&gt;[http://paucaverba.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-madonna-della-strada.html Morris, Stephen P., "The Madonna della Strada", ''Pauca Verba'', May 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1568, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese erected the [[Church of the Gesù|Gesù Church of Rome]], the mother church of the Jesuits, in place of the former church of Santa Maria della Strada. The fresco was moved there in 1575 to a side chapel where Jesuits pronounced their vows. Sometime in the 19th century, the image was transferred to canvas and affixed to a slate panel.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

[[File:Il Gesù 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Altar of ''Madonna Della Strada'']]
The icon is  located between two altars, the first dedicated to [[Ignatius of Loyola]], the second, the main altar of the Church, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Louis A. Bonacci, "[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/s/santa-maria-della-strada.php Santa Maria della Strada]," ''All About Mary''. International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton&lt;/ref&gt;

The icon was restored in 2006, revealing at least two layers of previous paint, the original art being a fresco which had been detached from a wall and affixed to canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contemplatioadamorem.blogspot.com/2006/12/restored-image-of-madonna-della-strada.html "Restored image of the Madonna della Strada", Contemplatio ad amorem, December 04, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Jesuits celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Way on May 24. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjweb.info/resources/Calender_Liturgy/2012-18_Proper%20Calendar%20SI_ENG.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapel dedicated to ''[[Madonna Della Strada Chapel|Madonna Della Strada]]'' at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/mdsweddings/ "Madonna Della Strada weddings", Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scranton.edu/about/community-relations/religious-services.shtml "Campus Religious Services", University of Scranton, Scranton, Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; and at Zilber Hall, [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/magazine/recent.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1349125200 Bazan, Jessie.

'''Multiven Group BV''' is a Netherlands-based provider of independent and decentralised software integrity maintenance and cyber-defence services for multivendor [[Internet Protocol]] [[Computer network|network]] hardware and [[blockchain]] nodes. Its customers include [[Fortune 500|large enterprises]], [[Internet service provider]]s, [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small, medium businesses]], [[Telecommunication companies|Telecommunications companies]], [[Fortune 500]], [[Academia]] and [[government]] agencies.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Multiven was founded in 2005 in [[Palo Alto]] [[California]] by British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/multiven-takes-on-giants-with-crowdsourced-network-support-2135848/|title=Multiven takes on giants with crowdsourced network support|last=Reeves|first=Ed|date=December 4, 2012|publisher=Information Age|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to build a company able to maintain the integrity of the world's Internet infrastructure without a hardware, software or political agenda. 

Headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Multiven is today the world's first and only independent provider of software management, maintenance and cyber-defence services for Internet networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Multiven,%20Inc.%20v.%20Cisco%20Systems,%20Inc.-dec2008.pdf|title=Multiven v. Cisco - December 1, 2008|date={{date|2008-12-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiven has regional sales offices in Paris, France, London, UK, Dubai, UAE.

=== History of Market ===
[[Internet|The Internet]], a short form of the word Internetwork, is an international ubiquitous network of networks. Given the amount of data traversing it, its criticality to personal, corporate and national security cannot be over-emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet Users Statistics and 2018 World Population Stats|website=www.internetworldstats.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet infrastructure comprises software-driven networked [[Network switch|switches]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Server (computing)|servers]] and storage hardware that switch, route, protect and store all  voice, video and text data intelligently across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm|title=How Does the Internet Work?|last=Shuler|first=Rus|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet equipment manufacturers like [[Cisco Systems Incorporated|Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Brocade Communications Systems|etc.]]. have a quasi monopoly on the multi-Billion dollar software maintenance services market for networking equipment through their own maintenance contracts and authorized third party maintenance. Multiven is the only provider offering a one-stop alternative for businesses of all sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Multiven,%20Inc.%20v.%20Cisco%20Systems,%20Inc.-dec2008.pdf|title=Multiven v. Cisco - December 1, 2008|date={{date|2008-12-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Multiven Open Marketplace ===
In March 2018, Multiven launched the development of the Multiven Open Marketplace, a [[blockchain]] project aiming to transition its existing business into a decentralized organisation. Multiven is developing a blockchain-based open Marketplace to allow customers to buy and sell new and pre-owned [[Information Technology]] hardware, software and services, on a peer-to-peer basis, without intermediaries, solely powered by smart contracts and one global [[Cryptocurrency]], the Multicoin. Multiven's maintenance and cybersecurity services will be accessible on the platform and can be bound to any hardware device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=220567|title=Multiven Announces its Initial Coin Offering (“ICO“) to Build the World’s First Blockchain-Based Marketplace for IT, Telecoms and Network Products and Services|date={{date|2018-02-21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems===
On December 1, 2008, Multiven filed a United States Federal [[antitrust]] lawsuit&lt;sup&gt;[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]&lt;/sup&gt; against [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]] in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven’s complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]] [[Software bug|bug]] fixes/[[Patch (software)|patches]] and updates for its [[operating system]] [[software]] to its maintenance services (“SMARTnet”) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and [[anticompetitive]] acts designed to maintain Cisco’s alleged [[monopoly]] in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; In April 2009 during a Cisco-initiated mediation, Cisco offered Multiven a few million dollars as settlement and limited software updates for its customers but insisted that Multiven couldn’t advertise its access to Cisco software updates. Multiven declined this offer as it still limited free and fair competition. The following month in May 2009, Cisco filed a set of false counterclaims against Multiven and alleged that in 2006 ''“Multiven’s CEO or someone under his control”'' viewed Cisco’s ‘protected’ public website 99 times and downloaded Cisco IOS five times with a total value of $14,000, using a Cisco-employee provided credentials.

=== Cisco Fabricated Criminal Charges against Multiven CEO ===
Cisco went on to communicate the exact same false allegations in its civil counterclaims to a local US prosecutor in San Jose and after several months in which US authorities prevented Peter Alfred-Adekeye’s re-entry into the country for participation in Multiven v. Cisco, a special hearing in the case took place at a Canadian hotel from 18 - 20 May 2010, involving a US [[special master]] and four Cisco lawyers. On 20 May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the [[antitrust]] suit of hacking and orchestrated his arrest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042011-former-engineer-who-sued-cisco.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_daily_am_2011-04-20 |title=Former engineer who sued Cisco now faces criminal charges |author=Robert Mcmillan &amp; Stephen Lawson |date=20 April 2011 |work=Network World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015005925/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042011-former-engineer-who-sued-cisco.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_daily_am_2011-04-20 |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the court session by Canadian police based on a misleading US arrest warrant while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in Multiven's antitrust hearing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9XZeHcClFg|title=Video: Cisco orchestrated arrest of Multiven CEO on false charges during Multiven v. Cisco Deposition in Canada|date={{date|2010-05-20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alfred-Adekeye was released after 28 days in custody but was forced to remain in Canada for another year before he was allowed to return to his home in Zurich, Switzerland. On May 31, 2011, Mr Justice Ronald McKinnon of the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed the extradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Justice%20McKinnon%20Verdict%20on%20Adekeye%20v%20Canada%20on%20Behalf%20of%20the%20USA.pdf|title=The Ruling of Mr Justice Ronald McKinnon of the British Columbia Supreme Court - USA v.

False material in the US attorney's letter had misled the judge who signed the Canadian arrest warrant. "Grotesquely inflated" charges and the unjustified portrayal of Alfred-Adekeye as a Nigerian-born scam artist and flight risk had misled the Canadian judicial system further. The underlying civil case by Multiven against Cisco had been withheld from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHpkp2N1HgA|title=Video: Multiven v.

=== Cisco Settles Multiven v. Cisco ===
On July 19, 2010, Cisco settled Multiven's antitrust lawsuit by making its operating system and application software updates, bug fixes and patches available to all Multiven customers worldwide. This settlement agreement transformed Multiven into Cisco's first and only independent competitor in the multi-Billion dollars per year software maintenance services business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://multiven.com/#/advocacy/07192010|title=After weeks of deliberation, Cisco settles Multiven v.

=== Libel Lawsuit Against Cisco ===
On July 20, 2015, Multiven CEO, Peter Alfred-Adekeye initiated a libel lawsuit against Cisco for (1) falsely claiming that ''‘he or someone under his control at Multiven’'' downloaded and ‘stole’ Cisco software five times in 2006 from cisco.com (2) used this lie (a) to orchestrate his illegal arrest in Vancouver, Canada in 2010 during Multiven v. Cisco and (b) to fabricate an ‘indictment’ in August 2011 after the Canadian Supreme Court threw out Cisco/US Government’s extradition request and (3) continuing to knowingly propagate this falsehood till today, with the core purpose of defaming Mr Alfred-Adekeye’s character and that of Multiven’s - Cisco’s only competitor in the global multi-Billion dollar per year services business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.multiven.com/advocacy/2015/07/20/|title=Multiven CEO Peter Alfred-Adekeye Files Libel Lawsuit Against Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of '''night in paintings''' is common in [[Western art history|Western art]]. Paintings that feature a night scene as the [[theme (arts)|theme]] may be [[religious art|religious]] or [[history painting]]s, [[genre art|genre]] scenes, [[portrait]]s, [[landscape]]s, or other subject types. Some artworks involve religious or [[fantasy]] topics using the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. The source of illumination in a night scene—whether it is the moon or an [[artificial light]] source—may be depicted directly, or it may be implied by the character and coloration of the light that reflects from the subjects depicted.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Historical overview==
Beginning in the early [[Renaissance]], artists such as [[Giotto]], [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Uccello]] and others told stories with their painted works, sometimes evoking religious themes and sometimes depicting battles, myths, stories and scenes from history, using night-time as the setting. By the 16th and 17th centuries, painters of the late Renaissance, [[Mannerist]]s, and painters from the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] era including [[El Greco]], [[Titian]], [[Giorgione]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]] often portrayed people and scenes in night-time settings, illustrating stories and depictions of real life.

Eighteenth-century [[Rococo]] painters [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]], and others used the night-time theme to illustrate scenes of the imagination, often with dramatic literary connotations, including scenes of secret liaisons and romantic relationships reminiscent of the popular 1782 book ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], used the themes of nighttime to depict illustrations of ordinary life. Poet and painter [[William Blake]] and painter [[Henry Fuseli]] used the night-time in their work as the setting for many of their most imaginative visions. The most dramatic use of the night-time can be seen in the 1793 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]], called ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', portraying the French revolutionary leader [[Jean-Paul Marat]] after his murder by [[Charlotte Corday]].

The night in paintings of the 19th century was used to convey a complex of diverse meanings. A mystical, religious, and sublime reverence for nature is seen in [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church|Frederick Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and others, while the powerful and dramatic [[romanticism]] of [[Francisco Goya]], [[Théodore Géricault]], and [[Eugène Delacroix]] served as visual reportage of current events, and in the case of Géricault revealed a scandal. [[Gustave Courbet]], who with [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Jules Breton]], [[Jean-François Millet]], and others created the [[Realism (art)|Realist school]], portrayed ordinary people hard at work, traveling, or engrossed in their everyday lives, at night and during the day. The [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] of the late 19th century used the night-time theme to express a multitude of emotional and aesthetic insights seen most dramatically in the paintings of [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and others.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Natten, Bertel Thorvaldsen, A901.tif|thumb|''Night'', relief by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] depicting the personified night.]]
Black and grey shades often symbolize [[gloom]], [[fear]], mystery, [[superstitions]], [[evil]], death, [[secret]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The light source in most religious paintings symbolize [[hope]], guidance or [[divinity]].

In fantasy paintings light could symbolize magic, like the following lines of a poem entitled ''The Magic'': "There's magic in this night, enshrouded in this night, hidden, like a lamp in an old man's robe, there's MAGIC."&lt;ref name=Favorite&gt;Favorite, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Gaddi, ''The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds''====
One of the first attempts in depicting night in paintings was by [[Taddeo Gaddi]], an Italian painter and architect.&lt;ref name=Farquhar&gt;Farquhar, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Gaddi, fascinated by nocturnal lighting, depicted the effect of the light in ''The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds'' night scene. The [[fresco]] at [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] in Florence, Italy features an incandescent [[angel]] as it hovers over a [[shepherd]].&lt;ref name="Paoletti and Radke"/&gt;{{rp|91}} Against the night sky the brilliance of the angel's bright glow, likely intended as "verification of the presence of God and as a metaphor for [[spiritual enlightenment]]", appears to startle the shepherd. Gaddi's use of [[monochrome|monochromatic]] colors in and around the shepherd reveals how the colors are made pale due to the remarkable illumination.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177, 179}}{{#tag:ref|A student and godson of [[Giotto di Bondone]], Gaddi was influenced by Giotti's exploration away from traditional [[Medieval art]]istic works towards development of solid three-dimensional characters using contrasting dark and light shades to suggest depth and shape.

[[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]{{#tag:ref|Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum has in its collection Taddeo Gaddi's ''Nativity'' which was made about 1325.|group=upper-alpha}} notes that: "This ensemble [''The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds''] is noted for its dynamism, pronounced foreshortening, dramatic effects of light and interest in narrative."&lt;ref name=museothyssen&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/219 ''Taddeo Gaddi, Biography''.] Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza.

====Giotto, ''Crucifixion''====
[[Giotto di Bondone]] (1266/7–1337), Taddeo Gaddi's teacher and godfather,&lt;ref name=Farquhar&gt;Farquhar, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}}{{#tag:ref|Giotto was an Italian painter in the [[late Middle Ages]] and generally considered a key contributor to the [[Italian Renaissance]].

ISSN 0024-3019.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} created the fresco of ''Crucifixion'', one of the multiple frescoes that told the story of Christ's life, for the Arena Chapel. He depicts Christ on a cross, while the [[Virgin Mary]] is comforted by [[John the Apostle|John]]. Kneeling at his feet is [[Mary Magdalene]], and swirling in the sky above Jesus and the watching crowd's heads are a number of angels. Giotto depicts night and heaven through the use of a deep blue background in the fresco panel and use of stars in the otherwise blue ceiling.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|383}}&lt;ref name="Life-Giotto"/&gt; He was able to create depth and dimension through the use of incremental degrees of light and dark shades, the precursor to [[chiaroscuro]]. He also used light in a way to represent the divinity of people and angels from the Bible, as he did in other frescoes at Arena Chapel.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|383}}

The Western tradition began properly in the 15th century, especially with depictions in [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the biblical night-time scenes of the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] in the Nativity story, and the [[Arrest of Christ]] and [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Passion of Christ]].

====Très Riches Heures, ''Christ in Gethsemane''====
In the book of miniatures, Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the scene of ''Christ in Gethsemane'' is an apcolyptic one which foretells the death of Christ, through the presence of three comets in the evening sky.&lt;ref&gt;Scheckner, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano'' is one of a three painting series that captures the Battle of San Romano. The passage of time, from dawn to evening, is illustrated in the three paintings with the initial use of pale, pastel shades and increasingly darker tones as the battle progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84,90}}

====Geertgen, ''Nativity at Night''====
Influenced by a vision of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]'s ''[[Nativity at Night (Geertgen tot Sint Jans)|Nativity at Night]]'' depicts the infant Jesus who "radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle."&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, including quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Strengthening the message about the baby Jesus being the light source, Geertgen depicts the child as the only source of illumination for the main scene inside the stable. Aglow are the faces of the angels, St Joseph and Virgin Mary. Although the shepherds' fire on the hill behind and the angel outside the window create a light source, it's dim in comparison to that provided by the infant child. The sharp contrast of the divine light against dark is a tool used to make the scene appear more profound for its viewers.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}}&lt;ref name=LNG-Geertgen&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night ''The Nativity at Night''.] The National Gallery, London.

====''Annunciation to the Shepherds''====
In the still of the night, the only source of light radiates in ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' comes from an angel who has come to tell the shepherds of the birth of the infant Christ. The light is so brilliant that the Bethlehem shepherds must shield their eyes. Aside from the startling angel, the nocturnal painting is a pleasant, still pastoral scene with a group of angels in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=112303 ''The Annunciation to the Shepherds.''] J.

====Adam Elsheimer====
Early [[Baroque]] artist [[Adam Elsheimer]] created night scenes that were highly original. His works departed slightly {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} from other works of the Baroque period were dramatic and abundantly detailed.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque paintings featured "exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, release from restraint, and even a kind of artistic sensationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Martin, Rosenwein, and Smith (2010). ''The Making of the West'' (third ed.). Boston: Bedford/ St. Martin's. pp. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Elsheimer's lighting effects in general were very subtle, and very different from those of [[Caravaggio]]. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it. &lt;!--- any more info about his use of light / depiction of night? ---&gt;

====Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio====
[[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] was an Italian artist active between 1593 and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the [[Baroque]] [[Baroque painting|school of painting]].&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|298–299}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name.]&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio's novelty was a radical [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of [[chiaroscuro]]. This came to be known as [[Tenebrism]], the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|299}}&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gilles Lambert, "Caravaggio", p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---- any more info about the specifically cited paintings? ---&gt;

====Georges de La Tour====
[[Georges de La Tour]] was a French Baroque painter who painted mostly religious [[chiaroscuro]] scenes lit by candlelight, which were more developed than his artistic predecessors, yet lacked dramatic effects of Caravaggio. He created some of the most arresting works in this genre, portraying a wide range of scenes by candlelight from card games to New Testament narratives.&lt;ref name=Blunt&gt;Blunt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- focus more specifically on cited works ---&gt;

====Aert van der Neer====
The [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Aert van der Neer]] was a [[landscape painter]], specializing in small night scenes lit only by moonlight and fires, and snowy winter landscapes, both often looking down a canal or river.

====Anthony van Dyck====
[[Anthony van Dyck]] (22 March 1599&amp;nbsp;– 9 December 1641) was a [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque artist]] and leading [[court painter]] in England.

[[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (23 April 1775&amp;nbsp;– 19 December 1851) was an English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape painter]],&lt;ref&gt;Lacayo, Richard, ''The Sunshine Boy'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1670528,00.html TIME Magazine], 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who is commonly known as "the painter of light".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/server.php?show=ConConstituent.539 Turner, Joseph Mallord William] National Gallery, London&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Vernet====
[[Joseph Vernet|Claude-Joseph Vernet]] (14 August 1714&amp;nbsp;– 3 December 1789) was a French painter whose landscapes, including those of moonlights were popular with English aristocrats. His ''The Port of Rochefort'' (1763, Musée national de la Marine) is particularly notable; in the piece Vernet is able to achieve, according to art historian [[Michael Levey]], one of his most 'crystalline and atmospherically sensitive skies'.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Wright====
[[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (3 September 1734&amp;nbsp;– 29 August 1797) was an English landscape and portrait painter who is notable for his use of [[Chiaroscuro]] effect, which emphasises the contrast of light and dark, and for his paintings of candle-lit subjects. Wright is seen at his best in his candlelit subjects. The ''[[Borghese Gladiator|Three Gentlemen observing the 'Gladiator']]'' (1765). ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the sun. ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) shows people gathered round observing an early experiment into the nature of air and its ability to support life.

These factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the air pump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.&lt;ref name=Baird&gt;{{cite web | last = Baird | first = Olga | author2 = Malcolm Dick | title = Joseph Wright of Derby: Art, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution | url = http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf | accessdate = 2007-11-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070316172422/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf | archivedate = 16 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Géricault]] (26 September 1791&amp;nbsp;– 26 January 1824) was an influential French artist and one of the pioneers of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].

====Atkinson Grimshaw====
[[File:Grimshaw-NightfallThames.jpg|thumb|[[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], ''Nightfall on the Thames'', 1880]]

[[Atkinson Grimshaw]] (6 September 1836&amp;nbsp;– 13 October 1893) was a Victorian-era artist&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Wood, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|173}} known for his city night-scenes and landscapes.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;Robertson, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyos&gt;[[H. J. Dyos]], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; His careful painting and skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His "paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene."&lt;ref&gt;Waller, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

''On Hampstead Hill'' is considered one of Grimshaw's finest works, exemplifying his skill with a variety of light sources, in capturing the mood of the passing of twilight into night. In his later career his urban scenes under twilight or yellow streetlighting were popular with his middle-class patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Steer.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}}

In the 1880s, Grimshaw maintained a London studio in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], not far from the studio of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. After visiting Grimshaw, Whistler remarked that "I considered myself the inventor of Nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures."&lt;ref name=Lambourne&gt;Lambourne, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}} Unlike Whistler's [[Impressionism|Impressionistic]] night scenes Grimshaw worked in a realistic vein: "sharply focused, almost photographic," his pictures innovated in applying the tradition of rural moonlight images to the Victorian city, recording "the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry."&lt;ref name=Lambourne/&gt;{{rp|112–113}}&lt;!--- probably still needs more editing, but leaving for the moment.---&gt;

====Petrus van Schendel====
[[Petrus van Schendel]] (1806–1870) was a Dutch Romantic painter,&lt;ref&gt;WG Flippo. (1981). Lexicon of the Belgian Romantic Painters, Antwerp.&lt;/ref&gt; etcher and draughtsman. Van Schendel specialised in nocturnal Dutch market scenes, exploring the effects the soft light had upon his subjects, as a result he was named '''Monsieur Chandelle''' by the French. Van Schendel was inspired by these famous forebears, but brought a unique nineteenth century mood to his night scenes. He eloquently captured the mysterious world of city markets illuminated by lamps and moonlight before the dawn.

====James Abbott McNeill Whistler====

[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] (11 July 1834&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1903) was an American-born, British-based artist.&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"&gt;Anderson and Koval, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}}
&lt;!---- commented out for now, some of this may be relevant later
In Paris Whistler met [[Charles Baudelaire]] whose ideas and theories of "modern" art influenced Whistler. Baudelaire challenged artists to scrutinize the brutality of life and nature and to portray it faithfully, avoiding the old themes of mythology and allegory.&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|48}} [[Théophile Gautier]], one of the first to explore translational qualities among art and music, may have inspired Whistler to view art in musical terms.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;Peters, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}----&gt;

Whistler's ill-advised journey in 1866 to [[Valparaíso, Chile]],&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|141}} resulted in Whistler's first three nocturnal paintings—which he termed "moonlights" and later re-titled as "nocturnes"—night scenes of the harbor painted with a blue or light green palette. Later in London, he painted several more nocturnes over the next ten years, many of the [[River Thames]] and of [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]], a pleasure park famous for its frequent [[fireworks]] displays, which presented a novel challenge to paint. In his maritime nocturnes, Whistler used highly thinned paint as a ground with lightly flicked color to suggest ships, lights, and shore line.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|368}}&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;Peters, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} Some of the Thames paintings also show compositional and thematic similarities with the Japanese prints of [[Hiroshige]].&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;!--- likely more ce opportunities, but will wait and see--&gt;

In 1877 Whistler sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "asking two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler won the suit, but was awarded one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] for damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/whistler/ Whistler, James Abbott McNeill]. WebMuseumn, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the case bankrupted him. It has been suggested [[John Ruskin]] suffered from [[CADASIL]] and the visual disturbances this condition caused him might have been a factor in his irritation at this particular painting.&lt;ref name="Kempster"&gt;Kempster PA, Alty JE. (2008). [http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/9/2520.full.pdf John Ruskin's relapsing encephalopathy]. Brain. Sep;131(Pt 9):2520-5. {{doi|10.1093/brain/awn019}} {{PMID|18287121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler published his account of the trial in the pamphlet Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics, included in his later ''[[The Gentle Art of Making Enemies]]'' (1890).

===''The Night Watch'', Rembrandt van Rijn===
''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq'' by Dutch painter [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] is one of the most famous paintings in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} One of its key elements is the effective use of light and shadow ([[chiaroscuro]]).&lt;ref name=Boka&gt;Boka and Courteau, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61,65}} Made in 1642, it depicts the eponymous [[Schutterij|company]] moving out, led by Captain [[Frans Banning Cocq]] (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, [[Willem van Ruytenburch]] (dressed in yellow, with a white sash).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd, the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the small girl in the centre left background.&lt;ref name=Boka/&gt;{{rp|65}}

For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. The heavy varnish was only discovered in the 1940s and restoration began after 1975.&lt;ref name="Hagen and Hagen"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

===''The Third of May 1808'', Francisco Goya===

''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' by Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]] commemorates Spanish resistance to [[Napoleon]]'s armies during the occupation of 1808 in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|109}} The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, ''The Third of May 1808'' marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"&gt;Licht, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116–127}} According to the art historian [[Kenneth Clark]], ''The Third of May 1808'' is "the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130.}}

It is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprising&lt;ref name="Hagen and Hagen"/&gt;{{rp|363}} and centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]], the other a disorganized group of captives held at gun point. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, "by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target."&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{rp|127}}&lt;!--ref name was "rubens"--&gt; A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer.&lt;!----&lt;ref&gt;This is consistent with Murat's desire to choose as victims members of the lower classes and the clergy who organized them.&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boime, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|297}} The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of [[martyrdom]] in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of [[chiaroscuro]], and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|121}} However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by [[Jusepe de Ribera]], feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the "crown of martyrdom" for the victim.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|118}}

The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by [[Baroque]] artists, and perfected by [[Caravaggio]].&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|119}} Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in ''The Third of May'' the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the spiritual has been subverted.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|119}}

===''The Starry Night'', Vincent van Gogh===
''[[The Starry Night]]'', made by Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], depicts his memory of the view outside his sanitorium room window at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]] (located in southern France) at night.&lt;ref name=Zara-2012&gt;Zara, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}} Although Van Gogh was not very happy with the painting,&lt;ref name=letter607&gt;Van Gogh, Vincent. (author). Harrison, Robert. (ed.) (19 September 1889) [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/607.htm ''Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written in Saint-Rémy. Translated by Mrs. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, number 607.''] Webexhibits.org Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; art historian Joachim Pissarro cites ''The Starry Night'' as an exemplar of the artist's fascination with the [[nocturnal]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol.

Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Van Gogh's most popular pieces, the painting is widely hailed as his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref name=Zara-2012/&gt;{{rp|225}}

===''Nighthawks'', Edward Hopper===
[[Edward Hopper]] had a lifelong interest in capturing the effect of light on the objects it touched, including the nighttime effect of artificial, man-made light spilling out of windows, doorways and porches. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' was probably Hopper's most ambitious essay in capturing the night-time effects of man-made light. For one thing, the diner's plate-glass windows cause significant light to spill out onto the sidewalk and the brownstones on the far side of the street. As well, interior light comes from more than a single lightbulb, with the result that multiple shadows are cast, and some spots are brighter than others as a consequence of being lit from more than one angle. Across the street, the line of shadow caused by the upper edge of the diner window is clearly visible towards the top of the painting.  These windows, and the ones below them as well, are partly lit by an unseen streetlight, which projects its own mix of light and shadow. As a final note, the bright interior light causes some of the surfaces within the diner to be reflective. This is clearest in the case of the right-hand edge of the rear window, which reflects a vertical yellow band of interior wall, but fainter reflections can also be made out, in the counter-top, of three of the diner's occupants. None of these reflections would be visible in daylight.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== ''The Empire of Light'', René Magritte ===
In his 1950 painting ''[[The Empire of Light]],'' [[René Magritte]] (1898–1967),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3692&amp;page_number=6&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMA collection]&lt;/ref&gt; explores the illusion of night and day, and the [[paradox]] of time and light. On the top half of his canvas Magritte paints a clear blue sky and white clouds that radiate bright daytime; while on the bottom half of his canvas below the sky, he paints a street, sidewalk, trees and houses all steeped in the darkness of night. The darkened trees and darkened houses appear to be in nighttime shadows, in the middle of the night; and the sidewalk streetlight is on to guide the way. Some of the questions implied by these pictures include is it night-time? is it daytime? or is it just a painting? ''The Empire of Light'' is one of a series of paintings that René Magritte painted between 1950 and 1954 that explores his surrealist insight into illusion and reality, using night and day as his subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Empire%20of%20Light&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=76.2553.102 Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3692&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1&amp;section_id=T053160#skipToContent MoMA biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nise-e''' (似絵), or "likeness pictures," were a style of [[portrait painting|portraiture]] popular in the [[Court (royal)|court]] circles of Japan's [[Kamakura period]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/nise-e|title=nise-e {{!}} Japanese art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 12th century [[Japanese art]] was purely religious in character, but nise-e introduced the realistic depiction of [[Laity|lay]] figures such as [[Courtier|courtiers]] and [[samurai]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Evgeny|date=2013|title=Zen Portraits Chinzō: Why do They Look as They do?|url=https://terebess.hu/zen/szoto/Chinzo.docx|journal=Terebess Asia Online|volume=|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of nise-e even helped to end the [[taboo]] against artistic depictions of the emperor, with one of earliest nise-e to depict a living [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] being a portrait of [[Emperor Hanazono]] by [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor_Hanazono_large.jpg Gōshin].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirayama|first=Mikiko|title=The Emperor's New Clothes: Japanese Visuality and Imperial Portrait Photography|journal=History of Photography|volume=33|issue=2|pages=165–184|doi=10.1080/03087290902768099|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a nise-e portrait was to capture a man's character with a few simple lines; and the work served as a veneration of his accomplishments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

[[Fujiwara Takanobu]] is generally considered to have originated the nise-e style and technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Takanobu|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00179192|journal=Benezit Dictionary of Artists|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; He innovated the use of jutting, angular outlines and dense swaths of color which came to characterize nise-e portraiture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fujiwara-Takanobu|title=Fujiwara Takanobu {{!}} Japanese painter|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takanobu's influence is seen in the works of his son [[Fujiwara Nobuzane]], and descendants Tametsugu, Korenobu, Tamenobu, and Gōshin, who continued to develop the nise-e school alongside others such as Shinkai and Tametaga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fujiwara-Nobuzane|title=Fujiwara Nobuzane {{!}} Japanese painter|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Nobuzane|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00131087|journal=Benezit Dictionary of Artists|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nise-e portraiture also greatly influenced the 18th century portrait style ''nigao-e'' (likeness head), pioneered by [[Katsukawa Shunshō]]  in response to a desire for [[Kabuki|actor]] portraits with realistic and expressive facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Shunsho|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00168949|journal=Benezit Dictionary of Artists|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Noureddin, Son of Iran''''' ({{lang-fa|نورالدین پسر ایران}}) is the memoirs of [[Sayyid]] Noureddin Afi from the 80 months of his participation in the [[Iran–Iraq war]]. ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' led to Afi's reputation in Iran after it was published by Sureye Mehr Publication in 2011. In 1994, Mousa Ghayour recorded the memoirs of Noureddin Afi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and it was presented as a written book by Masoume Sepehri years later. َThis book consisted of 18 chapters along with photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibna.ir/vdcauwn6y49nia1.tgk4.html Iran Book News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator mentions a dream as the reason of producing this war memoir.&lt;ref name="Mashregh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/117519/%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D9%83%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA |title= "Noureddin, Son of Iran" The memoir of a man who believed he had done nothing|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Mashreghnews.com |publisher= |accessdate= 4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' received an honorable menion in the "Memoir" category of the [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad Literary Awards]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |title=No winner selected for Iran’s most lucrative literary awards this year |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210083837/http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |archivedate=10 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
[[Sayyid]] Noureddin wants to participate the Iran–Iraq war, but he is not allowed at first because he is still young. He tries repeatedly and finally they let him go to war. He attends a military training course in the fall of 1980, and heads toward the western zones of Iran to serve in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Sepah]] of the [[Mehabad]]. He moves to the southern war zones along with his brother, Sadegh. Nourreddin loses his brother in an Iraqi [[airstrike]]. With shrapnel in his body they make him go under surgery in the hospitals of [[Mashhad]] and [[Kermanshah]] many times. But he does not recover well because he is severely damaged in the face, eyes and stomach. Due to the severe injuries on his face, his countenance changes when he is only 18. In 1984, he marries a 16-year-old girl named Masoume and their child is born 4 years later. The war finishes but he is still suffering the injuries and he misses his lovely friends, especially Amir Maralbash who was killed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manvaketab.ir/145079-نورالدین-پسر-ایران/bz=fs Book introduction, Nourreddin, Son of Iran (Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it was written==
In the last page of his memoir, Afi expresses his motivation for recounting his war memories as such:
{{quote|I never thought that, telling the memories is important nowadays. However, war memories and interviews were not discussed and I was involved with the side effects my injuries. In 1994, I dreamed that Mr [[Khamenei]] was reading some papers and crying. I was there, Some one said that these papers were the memories of a %70 [[veteran]] who had participated in war for 80 months and still said he had nothing for the war...My mind was busy with this dream and I felt my duty would finish by telling these memories. So, I  recounted the eight years of living in the war context to make those unique times survive for ever. (P632)&lt;ref name="Mashregh"/&gt;}}

==Animated movie==

''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' is a [[Computer animation|computer animated]] movie directed by Meisam Hosseini. The movie consists of 30 parts of 15 minutes each. Famous Iranian artists such as Atila Pesyani, [[Pejman Bazeghi]], Ali Saleh Ala and Masoud Forutan worked on the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mehrnews.com/detail/News/2136101 |title= "Noureddin, Son of Iran" with the voice of Iranian famous artists/from Saleh Ala and Pesyani to Bazeghi and Forutan|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= mehrnews.com/  Mehr News |publisher= |accessdate= 4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Directive 2012/28/EU''' is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] of the [[European Parliament]] and [[European Council]] enacted on 25 October 2012 that pertains to certain uses of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive sets out common rules on the digitisation and online display of orphan works.&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a diligent search has been completed a work can be registered at the orphan works register of the European Union Intellectual Property Office. Registering a work at that database allows for certain permitted uses of that work by cultural heritage institutions.

==Basis==

Orphan works are works like books, newspaper articles, or films, which may be protected under [[copyright]] but for which the copyright holder cannot be found. A substantial portion of the collections of Europe's cultural institutions are orphan works (e.g. the British Library estimates that 40 per cent of its copyrighted collections, 150 million works in total, are orphan works).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo – Orphan works – FAQ|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-743_en.htm?locale=en|work=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Public libraries, educational institutions and museums, that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public,&lt;ref name= Netanel&gt;{{Cite book| last= Netanel| first= Neil| title= Copyright's paradox| publisher= Oxford University Press US| year= 2008| page= 200| url= https://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-19-513762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear that a re-appearing rights-holder may sue them for damages.&lt;ref name= Borgman&gt;{{Cite book| last= Borgman| first= Christine L.| title= Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the internet| publisher= MIT Press| year= 2007| page= 108| url= http://Google.com/books?id=ZDDu3CuzDdMC&amp;dq=orphan+works+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn= 978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has set out large-scale digitisation programs (such as [[Europeana]]) and in order for these programs to be successful, common rules on how to deal with orphan works need to be established.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

==Works Covered by the Directive==

This directive applies to the following orphan works that were created in the EU:

* printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers)
* [[cinematographic]] and audio-visual works
* [[Sound recording|phonogram]]s
* works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book)

Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;
If orphaned software and video games ("[[Abandonware]]") fall under the ''audiovisual works'' definition is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf|title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=18 January 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

The directive provides regulations on how to identify orphan works. An organisation that wishes to digitise a work in question has to conduct a scrupulous search to find its copyright holder. In this search, it should rely on sources such as databases and registries like ARROW&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrow-net.eu&lt;/ref&gt; for text and image-based works. A registry for [[orphan film]] is currently developed by ACE – [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]] in the FORWARD project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.project-forward.eu&lt;/ref&gt; A diligent search guideline and tool has also been developed by the EnDOW project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritageportal.eu/News-Events/Latest-News/EnDOW-Heritage-Plus-Project-Profile.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Its [http://diligentsearch.eu/ tool] for diligent searches is available for 20 European Union Member states. It is hoped that other sectors will develop similar information databases.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

The directive also establishes that if a search does not find the identity or location of the copyright holder, the work shall be officially recognised as an orphan work. This status shall be valid for the whole of the [[European Union]], which means the organisation will be able to make it available online in all Member States. The directive also foresees the establishment of a single European registry of all recognised orphan works that will be set up and run by [[European Union Intellectual Property Office|EUIPO]], the European Union Intellectual Property Office based in [[Alicante]].&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Works identified as orphan works can be used by beneficiary organisations to achieve aims related to their public interest mission. They will be allowed to conclude public-private partnerships with commercial operators and to generate revenues from the use of orphan works to cover digitisation costs.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Under this directive, a reappearing copyright-holder can assert his/her copyright and thereby end the orphan work status.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

[[Image:Zeitschriften.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Consumer]] [[magazine]] sponsored [[advertisement]]s and covers rely heavily on professional page layout skills to compete for visual attention.]]
'''Page layout''' is the part of [[graphic design]] that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a [[Page (paper)|page]]. It generally involves organizational principles of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] to achieve specific communication objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Z|title=Elements and principles of design: Tools for digital imagery, art and design|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium.  It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize.  Low-level [[pagination]] and [[typesetting]] are more mechanical processes.  Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way.  Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always [[automation|automated]].  The result might be published as-is (as for a residential [[telephone directory|phone book]] interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a [[Magazine]].

Beginning from early [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] pages in hand-copied books of the [[Middle Ages]] and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

== History and layout technologies ==

==={{anchor|Direct physical layout|Page setting}}Direct physical page setting===

With [[manuscript]]s, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.

With ancient [[woodblock printing]], all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.

With the Renaissance invention of [[letterpress printing]] and cold-metal [[moveable type]], [[typesetting]] was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a [[composing stick]] into a galley—a long tray.  Any images would be created by [[engraving]].

The original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, [[markup language|markup]] would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called "manuscripts" and the markup process was the same.)

After the first round of typesetting, a [[galley proof]] might be printed in order for [[proofreading]] to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup.  The final layout would be constructed in a "form" or "forme" using pieces of wood or metal ("[[Furniture (typesetting)|furniture]]") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a [[Chase (typesetting)|chase]], and objects which lock down the frame known as [[quoins]].  This process is called [[imposition]], and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed.  An "imposition proof" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.

The invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce [[Slug (typesetting)|slugs]]—entire lines of text—using a keyboard.  The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine.  The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.

===Paste-up era===
[[File:Editorial_office_of_Bild_newspaper,_West_Berlin,_1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Editor#Print media|Editors]] work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]],'' 1977 in [[West Berlin]]. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. ]]
[[Offset lithography]] allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press.  This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed.  Type could be set with a [[typewriter]], or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine.  The [[IBM Selectric Composer]], for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including [[proportional font]]s), and with [[text justification]].  With [[photoengraving]] and [[halftone]], physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.

The layout process then became the task of creating the [[paste up]], so named because [[rubber cement]] or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper.  Completed pages become known as [[camera-ready]], "mechanical" or "mechanical art".

[[Phototypesetting]] was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up.  These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.

=== Computer-aided publishing ===

As the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set.  In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, [[cathode ray tube]]s were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of "flat screen" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flat panel display]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

[[Printer (computing)|Printers]] attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a [[ditto machine]] or [[photocopier]]. [[WYSIWYG]] [[word processor]]s made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters.  Early [[dot matrix printing]] was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. [[Inkjet printing]] and [[laser printing]] did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.

With modern [[desktop publishing]] software such as flagship software [[Adobe Indesign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html|title=Buy Adobe InDesign CC - Desktop publishing software and online publisher|author=|date=|website=www.adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cloud-based [[Lucidpress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/tour/free-page-layout-software|title=Free Page Layout Software|author=|date=26 May 2015|website=lucidpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the layout process can occur entirely on-screen.  (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, "word processing" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.)  A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer).  Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas.  Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use [[computer to plate]] technology to skip the physical original entirely. [[PostScript]] and [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.

===Digital media (non-paper)===

Since the advent of [[personal computing]], page layout skills have expanded to [[electronic media]] as well as print media. [[E-book]]s, PDF documents, and static [[web page]]s mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add [[multimedia]] animation, and interactivity.  Page layout for [[interactive media]] overlaps with [[interface design]] and [[user experience]] design; an interactive "page" is better known as a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).

Modern web pages are typically produced using [[HTML]] for content and general structure, [[cascading style sheet]]s to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity.  Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a [[text editor]], or a special [[HTML editor]] which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids.  Additional technologies such as [[Macromedia Flash]] may be used for multimedia content. [[Web developer]]s are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate [[web designer]] may be responsible for establishing the layout.  A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.

===Projected pages===

Projected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.

The [[magic lantern]] and [[opaque projector]] were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of [[photographic film]] (one negative and one positive) or one [[reversal film]] can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. [[Intertitle]]s were used extensively in the earliest [[motion picture]]s when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous [[vanity card]]s and [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]].

It became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using [[overhead projector]]s in the 1940s, and [[slide projector]]s in the 1950s. [[Transparency (projection)|Transparencies]] for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers.  Computer [[presentation program]]s became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally.  Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using [[LCD]] overhead projectors.  Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a [[video projector]], [[computer monitor]], or [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]].

Laying out a [[presentation]] presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages.  Consideration might be given to:
* Sizing text and graphics so they can be seen from the back of the room, which limits the amount of information that can be presented on a single slide
* Using headers, footers, or repeated elements to make all pages similar so they feel cohesive, or indicate progress
* Using titles to introduce new topics or segments
* Pacing, so slides are changed at comfortable intervals, fit the length of the talk, and content order matches the speaker's expectation
* Providing a way for the speaker to refer to specific items on the page, such as with color, verbal labels, or a [[laser pointer]]
* Editing the information presented so it either repeats what the speaker is saying (so the audience can pay attention to either) or only presents information that cannot be conveyed verbally (to avoid dividing audience attention or simply reading slides directly)
* Use of animation to add emphasis, introduce information slowly, or be entertaining
* Making the slides useful for later reference if printed as handouts or posted online

== Grids versus templates ==
[[Grid (page layout)|Grid]]s and templates are page layout design patterns used in [[advertising campaign]]s and multiple-page publications, including [[website]]s.

A '''grid''' is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.

In contrast, a '''template''' is more rigid.  A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.

Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with [[Desktop publishing#Terminology|master page]] features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.

==Static versus dynamic layouts==
Static layouts allow for more control over the [[aesthetics]], and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In [[web design]], this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All [[Image file formats#Raster formats|raster image formats]] are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.

In contrast, electronic pages allow for [[dynamic publishing|dynamic layouts]] with swapping content, [[personalization]] of styles, text scaling, [[image scaling]], or [[reflowable document|reflowable]] content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to [[separation of presentation and content|separate presentation from content]], which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.

Static layout design may involve more graphic design and [[visual art]] skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more [[interactive design]] and [[content management]] skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.

[[Motion graphics]] don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants [[motion graphic design]] more than static graphic design or interactive design.

Electronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a [[web banner]] may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]] and flow content around contours.

==Front-end versus back-end==
With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between [[visual communication]]s ('''front-end''') and [[information technology]] ('''back-end'''). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require [[meta data]] for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data ([[meta tags]]) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.

More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the [[front and back ends|front-end]], and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as [[image editing software]] or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.

==Design elements and choices==

Page layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a [[Style guide|house style]] which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template.  There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).

Typical page layout decisions include:
* Size of page [[Margin (typography)|margins]]
* Size and position of images and figures
* Deciding on the number and size of [[Column (typography)|columns]] and gutters (gaps between columns)
* Placement of intentional [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]
* Use of special effects like overlaying text on an image, [[Runaround (typography)|runaround]] and intrusions, or [[Bleed (printing)|bleeding]] an image over the page margin
* Use of [[color printing]] or [[spot color]] for emphasis

Specific elements to be laid out might include:
* Chapter or section titles, or [[headline]]s and [[subhead]]s
* [[Photo caption|Image captions]]
* [[Pull quote]]s and [[nut graph]]s which might be added out of course or to make a short story fit the layout
* [[Boxout]]s and [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebars]], which present information as asides from the main text flow
* [[Page header]]s and [[page footer]]s, the contents of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software.  The [[page number]] is usually included in the header or footer, and software automatically increments it for each page.
* [[Table of contents]]
* [[Note (typography)|Notes]] like footnotes and end notes; [[bibliography]], for example in academic journals or textbooks

In newspaper production, final selection and [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor.  Likewise, [[headline]]s might be written by the layout editor, a [[copy editor]], or the original author.

To make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to [[typography]] elements like [[font size]] or [[leading]].

===Floating block===
A floating block in [[writing]] and [[publishing]] is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and [[table (information)|table]]s is a typical feature of [[academic writing]] and [[technical writing]], including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled ''figure'' (for pictures, diagrams, [[Plot (graphics)|plots]], etc.) and ''table''.  An alternative name for figure is '''image''' or '''graphic'''.

Floating blocks are said to be ''floating'' because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page.  By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA2 ''New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX, Comprehensive'']. p. VS-B2.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, [[typesetting]] is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.

For example, an article on [[geography]] might have "Figure 1: Map of the world", "Figure 2: Map of Europe", "Table 1: Population of continents", "Table 2: Population of European countries", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures—in addition to the [[table of contents]]—that lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.

Other kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:

: Sidebar:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-I0_7Utu58C&amp;pg=PT406 ''Sams Teach Yourself Dreamweaver CS5 in 24 Hours'']. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an ''intermezzo''. See [[sidebar (publishing)]].
: Program: Articles and books on [[computer programming]] often place code and [[algorithms]] in a figure.
: Equation: Writing on [[mathematics]] may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart from the main text.

==Presenting layouts under development==

A [[mockup]] of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready.  Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch.  A [[comprehensive layout]] for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue.  A [[website wireframe]] is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.

[[Lorem ipsum]] text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published.  Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled "[[for position only]]".

'''Pithora''' is a highly ritualistic painting done on the walls by several tribes such as the [[Rathwa]]s and [[Bhilala]]s who live in the central [[Gujarat]], , in a village called [[Tejgadh]]. In several other villages around Tejgadh (even in [[Madhya Pradesh]]) and [[Chhota Udaipur district]] , lives a large population of these tribes where we find Pithora paintings on three inner walls of the house. These paintings have significance in their lives and executing the Pithora paintings in their homes brings peace, prosperity and happiness. What is even more interesting is that there is never an attempt to imitate nature. A horse or a bull, which might be a vision of a God, impresses him with only one central quality. This central quality is worked upon and given a form. It might be crude but it is this crudity that adds to the beauty of this painting.

[[File:Pithora wall painting.JPG|thumbnail|right|A Pithora painting at the [[National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, New Delhi|Crafts Museum]] in New Delhi]]
Pithora paintings are more of a ritual than an art form. These rituals are performed either to thank God or for a wish or a boon to be granted. The Bhadwa or the head priest of the tribe is summoned and the problems are narrated. These problems can vary from dying cattle, to unwell children in the family. The concerned person is given a solution and is asked, by the Bhadwa, to perform the ritual and the painting. The presence of Pithora Baba is considered as a solution to all the problems. A Pithora is always located at the threshold, or the Osari, outside the first front wall or inside on the walls of the first room as one enters a house. The painting usually floods the entire wall with figures. Three walls are prepared for the painting, the front wall and the two on either side of it. The front or central wall is very large, twice the size of each of the sidewalls. These walls are treated with two layers of cow dung paste and one layer of white chalk powder. Unmarried girls bring in these materials. This procedure is called Lipna. The main wall of the verandah that divides it from the kitchen is considered sacred to the Pithoro. The wall paintings related to the legends of creation and Pithoro, are done on this wall. The two sidewalls of the veranda are also painted with figures of minor deities, ghosts and ancestors.

The so-called '''portrait of Paquius Proculus''' is a [[fresco]] currently preserved at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] that was found in [[Pompeii]].

The fresco depicts a pair of middle-class Pompeians, almost certainly husband and wife.  They are commonly referred to as "Paquius Proculus and his wife", due to an inscription found on the outside of the house,{{citation needed|reason=reference inscription|date=November 2018}} although a graffito inside the house later revealed the man to be Terentius Neo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/pompeii/regio-i/reg-i-ins-7/house-of-paquius-proculus | title=House of Paquius Proculus | publisher=AD79 | accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The external inscription turned out to be an election advertisement for Paquius Proculus, who had been elected [[duumviri|duovir]] some time prior to the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD|eruption]].&lt;ref name="pompeisepolta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pompeisepolta.com/paquio.htm|title=Casa di Paquio Proculo|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Pompei Sepolta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305143007/http://pompeisepolta.com/paquio.htm|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man in the fresco wears a toga, the mark of a Roman citizen, and holds a [[rotulus]], suggesting he is involved in local public and/or cultural events.  The woman holds a [[stylus]] and [[wax tablet]], emphasizing that she is educated and literate, and is managing the bakery.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA106?set_language=en|title=Paquius Proculus an wife|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222104832/http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA106?set_language=en|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is suspected, based on the physical features of the couple, that they are [[Samnites]], which may explain the desire to show off the status they have reached in Roman society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''José Rafael Moneo Vallés''' (born 9 May 1937) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[architect]]. He won the [[Pritzker Prize]] for architecture in 1996 and the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 2003. 

==Life and career==
Born in [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Spain]], Moneo studied at the [[ETSAM]], [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM) from which he received his architectural degree in 1961. From the [[Davis Museum and Cultural Center|Davis Art Museum]] at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] and the [[Audrey Jones Beck]] [[Audrey Jones Beck Building|Building]] (an expansion of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]). Moneo also designed the [[Chace Center]], a new building for the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm ''Campus Initiatives: The Chace Center''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525140112/http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the Northwest Corner Building (formerly the Interdepartmental Science Building) at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] first opened. Moneo's most recent work is [[Peretsman-Scully Hall]] and the [[Princeton Neuroscience Institute]], which houses the psychology and neuroscience departments at [[Princeton University]] and opened in December 2013.

In 2012, he was awarded with 2012 [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for the Arts. According to the jury, Moneo is ''a Spanish architect of universal scope whose work enriches urban spaces with an architecture that is serene and meticulous. An acknowledged master in both the academic and professional field, Moneo leaves his own mark on each of his creations, at the same time as combining aesthetics with functionality, especially in the airy interiors that act as impeccable settings for great works of culture and the spirit.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/awards/2012/rafael-moneo-1/jury/ ''Minutes of the Jury for the 2012 Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts. ''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], and [[economics]], '''scale invariance''' is a feature of objects or laws that do not change if scales of length, energy, or other variables, are multiplied by a common factor, thus represent a universality.

The technical term for this [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] is a '''dilatation''' (also known as '''dilation'''), and the dilatations can also form part of a larger [[conformal symmetry]].

*In mathematics, scale invariance usually refers to an invariance of individual [[function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[curve]]s. A closely related concept is [[self-similarity]], where a function or curve is invariant under a discrete subset of the dilatations. It is also possible for the [[probability distribution]]s of [[random process]]es to display this kind of scale invariance or self-similarity.
*In [[classical field theory]], scale invariance most commonly applies to the invariance of a whole theory under dilatations. Such theories typically describe classical physical processes with no characteristic length scale.
*In [[quantum field theory]], scale invariance has an interpretation in terms of [[particle physics]]. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.
*In [[statistical mechanics]], scale invariance is a feature of [[phase transition]]s. The key observation is that near a phase transition or [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for an explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena. Such theories are scale-invariant [[statistical field theory|statistical field theories]], and are formally very similar to scale-invariant quantum field theories.
*[[universality (dynamical systems)|Universality]] is the observation that widely different microscopic systems can display the same behaviour at a phase transition. Thus phase transitions in many different systems may be described by the same underlying scale-invariant theory.
*In general, [[dimensionless quantities]] are scale invariant. The analogous concept in [[statistics]] are [[standardized moment]]s, which are scale invariant statistics of a variable, while the unstandardized moments are not.

==Scale-invariant curves and self-similarity==
In mathematics, one can consider the scaling properties of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[curve]] {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} under rescalings of the variable {{mvar|x}}.  That is, one is interested in the shape of {{math|''f'' (''λx'')}} for some scale factor {{mvar|λ}}, which can be taken to be a length or size rescaling. The requirement for  {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} to be invariant under all rescalings is usually taken to be
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x)=\lambda^{\Delta}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some choice of exponent {{mvar|Δ}}, and for all dilations {{mvar|λ}}. This is equivalent to {{mvar|f}} &amp;nbsp;  being a [[homogeneous function]] of degree {{mvar|Δ}}.

Examples of scale-invariant functions are the [[monomial]]s &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^n&lt;/math&gt;, for which {{math|Δ {{=}} ''n''}}, in that clearly

:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x) = (\lambda x)^n = \lambda^n f(x)~.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of a scale-invariant curve is the [[logarithmic spiral]], a kind of curve that often appears in nature. In [[polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'')}}, the spiral can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{b} \ln(r/a)~.&lt;/math&gt;

Allowing for rotations of the curve, it is invariant under all rescalings {{mvar|λ}}; that is, {{math|''θ''(''λr'')}} is identical to a rotated version of {{math|''θ''(''r'')}}.

===Projective geometry===
The idea of scale invariance of a monomial generalizes in higher dimensions to the idea of a [[homogeneous polynomial]], and more generally to a [[homogeneous function]]. Homogeneous functions are the natural denizens of [[projective space]], and homogeneous polynomials are studied as [[projective varieties]] in [[projective geometry]].  Projective geometry is a particularly rich field of mathematics; in its most abstract forms, the geometry of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], it has connections to various topics in [[string theory]].

===Fractals===
[[File:Kochsim.gif|thumb|right|250px|A [[Koch curve]] is [[self-similar]].]]
It is sometimes said that [[fractal]]s are scale-invariant, although more precisely, one should say that they are [[self-similar]]. A fractal is equal to itself typically for only a discrete set of values {{mvar|λ}}, and even then a translation and rotation may have to be applied to match the fractal up to itself.

Thus, for example, the [[Koch curve]] scales with {{math|∆ {{=}} 1}}, but the scaling holds only for values of {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 1/3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for integer {{mvar|n}}. In addition, the Koch curve scales not only at the origin, but, in a certain sense, "everywhere": miniature copies of itself can be found all along the curve.

Some fractals may have multiple scaling factors at play at once; such scaling is studied with [[multi-fractal analysis]].

Periodic [[External ray|external and internal rays]] are invariant curves .

==Scale invariance in stochastic processes==
If {{math|''P''(''f'' )}} is the [[expectation value|average, expected]] power at frequency {{mvar|f }}, then noise scales as
:&lt;math&gt;P(f) = \lambda^{-\Delta} P(\lambda f)&lt;/math&gt;
with {{mvar|Δ}} = 0  for [[white noise]],  {{mvar|Δ}} = −1  for [[pink noise]], and  {{mvar|Δ}} = −2  for [[Brownian noise]] (and more generally, [[Brownian motion]]).

More precisely, scaling in stochastic systems concerns itself with the likelihood of choosing a particular configuration out of the set of all possible random configurations. This likelihood is given by the [[probability distribution]].

Examples of scale-invariant distributions are the [[Pareto distribution]] and the [[Zipfian distribution]].

===Scale invariant Tweedie distributions===
'''[[Tweedie distributions]]''' are a special case of '''[[exponential dispersion model]]s''', a class of statistical models used to describe error distributions for the [[generalized linear model]] and characterized by [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jørgensen |first=B. |year=1997 |title=The Theory of Dispersion Models |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |isbn=0412997118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include a number of common distributions: the [[normal distribution]], [[Poisson distribution]] and [[gamma distribution]], as well as more unusual distributions like the compound Poisson-gamma distribution, positive [[stable distribution]]s, and extreme stable distributions.
Consequent to their inherent scale invariance Tweedie [[random variable]]s ''Y'' demonstrate a [[variance]] var(''Y'') to [[mean]] E(''Y'')  power law:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a[\text{E}\,(Y)]^p&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''a'' and ''p'' are positive constants. This variance to mean power law is known in the physics literature as '''fluctuation scaling''',&lt;ref name="Eisler2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisler |first=Z. |last2=Bartos |first2=I. |last3=Kertész |first3=J. |year=2008 |title=Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor's law and beyond |journal=[[Advances in Physics|Adv Phys]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=89–142 |doi=10.1080/00018730801893043 |arxiv = 0708.2053 |bibcode = 2008AdPhy..57...89E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ecology literature as [[Taylor's law]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kendal |first=W. S. |last2=Jørgensen |first2=B. |year=2011 |title=Taylor's power law and fluctuation scaling explained by a central-limit-like convergence |journal=Phys. Rev.

Random sequences, governed by the Tweedie distributions and evaluated by the [[Tweedie distributions|method of expanding bins]] exhibit a [[Logical biconditional|biconditional]] relationship between the variance to mean power law and power law [[autocorrelation]]s.  The [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] further implies that for any sequence that exhibits a variance to mean power law under these conditions will also manifest [[pink noise|''1/f'' noise]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kendal |first=W. S. |last2=Jørgensen |first2=B. |year=2011 |title=Tweedie convergence: A mathematical basis for Taylor's power law, 1/''f'' noise, and multifractality |journal=Phys. Rev.

The [[Tweedie distributions|'''Tweedie convergence theorem''']] provides a hypothetical explanation for the wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and ''1/f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jørgensen |first=B. |last2=Martinez |first2=J. R. |last3=Tsao |first3=M. |year=1994 |title=Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Statistics|Scand J Statist]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=223–243 |jstor=4616314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires, in essence, that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance to mean power law will be required express a [[natural exponential family|variance function]] that comes within the [[Attractor|domain of attraction]] of a Tweedie model.  Almost all distribution functions with finite [[cumulant|cumulant generating functions]] qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form.  Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this [[Asymptotic expansion|asymptotic behavior]], and  the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011" /&gt;

Much as the [[central limit theorem]] requires certain kinds of random variables to have as a focus of convergence the [[normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] and express [[white noise]], the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian random variables to express ''1/f'' noise and fluctuation scaling.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011" /&gt;

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;
In [[physical cosmology]], the power spectrum of the spatial distribution of the [[cosmic microwave background]] is near to being a scale-invariant function. Although in mathematics this means that the spectrum is a power-law, in cosmology the term "scale-invariant" indicates that the amplitude, {{math|''P''(''k'')}}, of [[primordial fluctuations]] as a function of [[wave number]], {{mvar|k}}, is approximately constant, i.e. a flat spectrum. This pattern is consistent with the proposal of [[cosmic inflation]].

==Scale invariance in classical field theory==
[[Classical field theory]] is generically described by a field, or set of fields,  ''φ'', that depend on coordinates, ''x''. Valid field configurations are then determined by solving [[differential equations]] for ''φ'', and these equations are known as [[field equation]]s.

For a theory to be scale-invariant, its field equations should be invariant under a rescaling of the coordinates, combined with some specified rescaling of the fields,
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\rightarrow\lambda^{-\Delta}\varphi~.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''Δ'' is known as the [[scaling dimension]] of the field, and its value depends on the theory under consideration.  Scale invariance will typically hold provided that no fixed length scale appears in the theory. Conversely, the presence of a fixed length scale indicates that a theory is '''not''' scale-invariant.

A consequence of scale invariance is that given a solution of a scale-invariant field equation, we can automatically find other solutions by rescaling both the coordinates and the fields appropriately. In technical terms, given a solution,  ''φ''(''x''), one always has other solutions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\Delta}\varphi(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Scale invariance of field configurations===
For a particular field configuration,  ''φ''(''x''),  to be scale-invariant, we require that
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)=\lambda^{-\Delta}\varphi(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Δ'' is, again, the [[scaling dimension]] of the field.

We note that this condition is rather restrictive. In general, solutions even of scale-invariant field equations will '''not''' be scale-invariant, and in such cases the symmetry is said to be [[spontaneously broken]].

===Classical electromagnetism===

An example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetism]] with no charges or currents. The fields are the electric and magnetic fields, '''E'''('''x''',''t'') and '''B'''('''x''',''t''), while their field equations are [[Maxwell's equations]].

With no charges or currents, [[electromagnetic field#Light as an electromagnetic disturbance|these field equations]] take the form of [[wave equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light.

These field equations are invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, given solutions of Maxwell's equations, '''E'''('''x''', ''t'') and '''B'''('''x''', ''t''),  it holds that 
'''E'''(λ'''x''', λ''t'') and '''B'''(λ'''x''', λ''t'')  are also solutions.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Another example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is the massless [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] (note that the name [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] is unrelated to scale invariance). The scalar field, {{math|''φ''('''''x''''', ''t'')}} is a function of a set of spatial variables, '''''x''''', and a time variable, {{mvar|t}}.

Consider first the linear theory. Like the electromagnetic field equations above, the equation of motion for this theory is also a wave equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2 \varphi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
and is invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t.&lt;/math&gt;

The name massless refers to the absence of a term &lt;math&gt;\propto m^2\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in the field equation. Such a term is often referred to as a `mass' term, and would break the invariance under the above transformation. In [[relativistic field theory|relativistic field theories]], a mass-scale, {{mvar|m}}  is physically equivalent to a fixed length scale through
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\hbar}{mc},&lt;/math&gt;
and so it should not be surprising that massive scalar field theory is ''not'' scale-invariant.

====φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory====
The field equations in the examples above are all [[linear]] in the fields, which has meant that the [[scaling dimension]], {{mvar|Δ}}, has not been so important. However, one usually requires that the scalar field [[action (physics)|action]] is dimensionless, and this fixes the [[scaling dimension]] of {{mvar|φ}}. In particular,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|D}} is the combined number of spatial and time dimensions.

Given this scaling dimension for {{mvar|φ}}, there are certain nonlinear modifications of massless scalar field theory which are also scale-invariant. One example is massless [[Phi to the fourth|φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory]] for {{mvar|D}}=4. The field equation is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2 \varphi+g\varphi^3=0.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that the name {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; derives from the form of the [[Phi to the fourth#The Lagrangian|Lagrangian]], which contains the fourth power of {{mvar|φ}}.)

When {{mvar|D}}=4 (e.g. three spatial dimensions and one time dimension), the scalar field scaling dimension is {{mvar|Δ}}=1. The field equation is then invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (x)\rightarrow\lambda^{-1}\varphi(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The key point is that the parameter {{mvar|g}} must be dimensionless, otherwise one introduces a fixed length scale into the theory: For  {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  theory, this is only the case in {{mvar|D}}=4.
Note that under these transformations the argument of the function {{mvar|φ}} is unchanged.

==Scale invariance in quantum field theory==
The scale-dependence of a [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) is characterised by the way its [[coupling constant|coupling parameters]] depend on the energy-scale of a given physical process. This energy dependence is described by the [[renormalization group]], and is encoded in the [[beta-function]]s of the theory.

For a QFT to be scale-invariant, its coupling parameters must be independent of the energy-scale, and this is indicated by the vanishing of the beta-functions of the theory. Such theories are also known as [[Renormalization group|fixed points]] of the corresponding renormalization group flow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Zinn-Justin|J. Zinn-Justin]] (2010)  Scholarpedia article [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach "Critical Phenomena: field theoretical approach"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum electrodynamics===
A simple example of a scale-invariant QFT is the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles. This theory actually has no coupling parameters (since [[photon]]s are massless and non-interacting) and is therefore scale-invariant, much like the classical theory.

However, in nature the electromagnetic field is coupled to charged particles, such as [[electron]]s. The QFT describing the interactions of photons and charged particles is [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the [[beta-function#Quantum electrodynamics|QED beta-function]]. This tells us that the [[electric charge]] (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles '''is''' scale-invariant, QED is '''not''' scale-invariant.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Free, massless [[scalar field (quantum field theory)|quantized scalar field theory]] has no coupling parameters. Therefore, like the classical version, it is scale-invariant. In the language of the renormalization group, this theory is known as the [[Gaussian fixed point]].

However, even though the classical massless ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory is scale-invariant in ''D''=4, the quantized version is '''not''' scale-invariant. We can see this from the [[beta-function]] for the coupling parameter, ''g''.

Even though the quantized massless ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is not scale-invariant, there do exist scale-invariant quantized scalar field theories other than the Gaussian fixed point. One example is the '''Wilson-Fisher fixed point''', below.

===Conformal field theory===
Scale-invariant QFTs are almost always invariant under the full [[conformal symmetry]], and the study of such QFTs is [[conformal field theory]] (CFT). [[operator (physics)|Operators]] in a CFT have a well-defined [[scaling dimension]], analogous to the [[scaling dimension]], ''∆'', of a classical field discussed above. However, the scaling dimensions of operators in a CFT typically differ from those of the fields in the corresponding classical theory. The additional contributions appearing in the CFT are known as [[anomalous scaling dimension]]s.

===Scale and conformal anomalies===
The φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory example above demonstrates that the coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can be scale-dependent even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant (or conformally invariant). If this is the case, the classical scale (or conformal) invariance is said to be [[conformal anomaly|anomalous]]. A classically scale invariant field theory, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provides an explication of the nearly exponential expansion of the early universe called [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], as long as the theory can be studied through [[perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvio, Strumia|title=Agravity|journal=JHEP  |volume=6 |pages=080|date=2014-03-17|url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1286134|arxiv = 1403.4226|bibcode = 2014JHEP...06..080S|doi=10.1007/JHEP06(2014)080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase transitions==
In [[statistical mechanics]], as a system undergoes a [[phase transition]], its fluctuations are described by a scale-invariant [[statistical field theory]]. For a system in equilibrium (i.e. time-independent) in {{mvar|D}} spatial dimensions, the corresponding statistical field theory is formally similar to a {{mvar|D}}-dimensional CFT. The scaling dimensions in such problems are usually referred to as [[critical exponent]]s, and one can in principle compute these exponents in the appropriate CFT.

===The Ising model===
An example that links together many of the ideas in this article is the phase transition of the [[Ising model]], a simple model of [[ferromagnet]]ic substances. This is a statistical mechanics model, which also has a description in terms of conformal field theory. The system consists of an array of lattice sites, which form a {{mvar|D}}-dimensional periodic lattice. Associated with each lattice site is a [[magnetic moment]], or [[spin (physics)|spin]], and this spin can take either the value +1 or −1. (These states are also called up and down, respectively.)

The key point is that the Ising model has a spin-spin interaction, making it energetically favourable for two adjacent spins to be aligned. On the other hand, thermal fluctuations typically introduce a randomness into the alignment of spins. At some critical temperature, {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} , [[spontaneous magnetization]] is said to occur. This means that below {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} the spin-spin interaction will begin to dominate, and there is some net alignment of spins in one of the two directions.

An example of the kind of physical quantities one would like to calculate at this critical temperature is the correlation between spins separated by a distance {{mvar|r}}. This has the generic behaviour:
:&lt;math&gt;G(r)\propto\frac{1}{r^{D-2+\eta}},&lt;/math&gt;
for some particular value of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, which is an example of a critical exponent.

====CFT description====
The fluctuations at temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are scale-invariant, and so the Ising model at this phase transition is expected to be described by a scale-invariant statistical field theory. In fact, this theory is the '''Wilson-Fisher fixed point''', a particular scale-invariant [[scalar field (quantum field theory)|scalar field theory]].

In this context, {{math|''G''(''r'')}} is understood as a [[correlation function]] of scalar fields,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi(0)\phi(r)\rangle\propto\frac{1}{r^{D-2+\eta}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now we can fit together a number of the ideas seen already.

From the above, one  sees that the critical exponent, {{mvar|η}}, for this phase transition, is also an '''anomalous dimension'''. This is because the classical dimension of the scalar field,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
is modified to become
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2+\eta}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|D}} is the number of dimensions of the Ising model lattice.

So this '''anomalous dimension''' in the conformal field theory is the ''same'' as a particular critical exponent of the Ising model phase transition.

Note that for dimension {{math|''D'' ≡ 4−''ε''}}, {{mvar|η}} can be calculated approximately, using the '''epsilon expansion''', and one finds that
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\epsilon^2}{54}+O(\epsilon^3)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the physically interesting case of three spatial dimensions, we have {{mvar|ε}}=1, and so this expansion is not strictly reliable. However, a semi-quantitative prediction is that {{mvar|η}} is numerically small in three dimensions.

On the other hand, in the two-dimensional case the Ising model is exactly soluble. In particular, it is equivalent to one of the [[minimal models]], a family of well-understood CFTs, and it is possible to compute {{mvar|η}} (and the other critical exponents) exactly,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{_{D=2}}=\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Schramm–Loewner evolution===
The anomalous dimensions in certain two-dimensional CFTs can be related to the typical [[fractal dimension]]s of random walks, where the random walks are defined via [[Schramm–Loewner evolution]] (SLE). As we have seen above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2''d'' critical Ising model and the more general 2''d'' critical [[Potts model]]. Relating other 2''d'' CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.

==Universality==
A phenomenon known as [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] is seen in a large variety of physical systems. It expresses the idea that different microscopic physics can give rise to the same scaling behaviour at a phase transition. A canonical example of universality involves the following two systems:
* The [[Ising model]] phase transition, described above.
* The [[liquid]]-[[vapour]] transition in classical fluids.

Even though the microscopic physics of these two systems is completely different, their critical exponents turn out to be the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.

The set of different microscopic theories described by the same scale-invariant theory is known as a [[universality class]]. Other examples of systems which belong to a universality class are:
* [[Avalanche]]s in piles of sand. The likelihood of an avalanche is in power-law proportion to the size of the avalanche, and avalanches are seen to occur at all size scales.
* The frequency of [[network outage]]s on the [[Internet]], as a function of size and duration.
* The frequency of citations of journal articles, considered in the network of all citations amongst all papers, as a function of the number of citations in a given paper.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* The formation and propagation of cracks and tears in materials ranging from steel to rock to paper. The variations of the direction of the tear, or the roughness of a fractured surface, are in power-law proportion to the size scale.
* The [[electrical breakdown]] of [[dielectric]]s, which resemble cracks and tears.
* The [[percolation]] of fluids through disordered media, such as [[petroleum]] through fractured rock beds, or water through filter paper, such as in [[chromatography]]. Power-law scaling connects the rate of flow to the distribution of fractures.
* The [[diffusion]] of [[molecule]]s in [[solution]], and the phenomenon of [[diffusion-limited aggregation]].
* The distribution of rocks of different sizes in an aggregate mixture that is being shaken (with gravity acting on the rocks).

The key observation is that, for all of these different systems, the behaviour resembles a [[phase transition]], and that the language of statistical mechanics and scale-invariant [[statistical field theory]] may be applied to describe them.

==Other examples of scale invariance==

===Newtonian fluid mechanics with no applied forces===

Under certain circumstances, [[fluid mechanics]] is a scale-invariant classical field theory. The fields are the velocity of the fluid flow, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and the fluid pressure, &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;. These fields must satisfy both the [[Navier–Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity equation]]. For a [[Newtonian fluid]] these take the respective forms
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \mathbf{u} = -\nabla P+\mu \left(\nabla^2 \mathbf{u}+\frac{1}{3}\nabla\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot \left(\rho\mathbf{u}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic viscosity#Viscosity .28dynamic viscosity.29: .CE.BC|dynamic viscosity]].

In order to deduce the scale invariance of these equations we specify an [[equation of state]], relating the fluid pressure to the fluid density. The equation of state depends on the type of fluid and the conditions to which it is subjected. For example, we consider the [[isothermal]] [[ideal gas]], which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;P=c_s^2\rho,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound in the fluid. Given this equation of state, Navier–Stokes and the continuity equation are invariant under the transformations
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda^2 t,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow\lambda^{-1} \rho,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\rightarrow\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;
Given the solutions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, we automatically have that
&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{u}(\lambda\mathbf{x},\lambda^2 t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\rho(\lambda\mathbf{x},\lambda^2 t)&lt;/math&gt; are also solutions.

===Computer vision===
{{Main article|Scale space}}
In [[computer vision]] and [[biological vision]], scaling transformations arise because of the perspective image mapping and because of objects having different physical size in the world. In these areas, scale invariance refers to local image descriptors or visual representations of the image data that remain invariant when the local scale in the image domain is changed.&lt;ref name=Lin13PONE&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066990 Lindeberg, T. (2013) Invariance of visual operations at the level of receptive fields, PLoS ONE 8(7):e66990.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AALMOZNINO4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Albert Almoznino]]'s shadow art]] --&gt;
{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

'''''The Brioche''''' is a late 19th century painting by French artist [[Édouard Manet]]. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts a [[brioche]] loaf resting on a table. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436946|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was produced after a painting of a brioche by 18th century artist [[Jean Siméon Chardin]] was donated to the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]; that donation spurred Manet to produce his own version in 1870. In Manet's work the brioche is accompanied by peaches and plums.

The work is on view in the Metropolitan Museum's Gallery 810.

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997. Accessed July 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Norton]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Anthony Wong Chau Sang]] and [[Liev Schreiber]] appear in the leading roles.

This is the third [[film adaptation]] of the Maugham book, following [[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|a 1934 film]] starring [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Herbert Marshall]] and a 1957 version called ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' with [[Bill Travers]] and [[Eleanor Parker]].

==Plot==
On a brief trip back to [[London]], earnest, bookish [[Microbiology|bacteriologist]] Walter Fane ([[Edward Norton]]) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin ([[Naomi Watts]]), a vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts ("only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible"), and the couple [[honeymoon]] in [[Venice]]. They travel on to Walter's medical post in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he is stationed in a government lab studying [[infectious diseases]]. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British [[expatriate]]s.

Kitty meets Charles Townsend ([[Liev Schreiber]]), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of [[adultery]], if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]]. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating "Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.

She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.

Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.

The cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease&lt;ref&gt;[[John Snow (physician)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.

Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies "No one important, darling".

==Production==

===Development===
Prior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for ''The Painted Veil''. The script was frequently redrafted, being written to be close to the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a [[feminism|feminist]] version. Actor [[Edward Norton]] became involved with the project in 1999.&lt;ref name=encore&gt;{{cite news | author=Charles McGrath | url= | title=Another Encore for the Most Adaptable of Authors | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norton explained his attraction to the project, "It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings."&lt;ref name=passion&gt;{{cite news | author=Terry Armour | url= | title=Edward Norton concentrates his passion on performing | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor suggested casting [[Naomi Watts]] for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003).  When Watts joined the project, she recommended director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]], with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film ''[[We Don't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The director's expertise with ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in ''The Painted Veil''.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  The project began development at producers [[Bob Yari]] and [[Mark Gordon]]'s Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start [[Warner Independent Pictures]], he brought the project with him.  Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by [[Warner Bros.]] production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's [[#Marketing|marketing difficulties]].&lt;ref name=trying&gt;{{cite news | author=John Horn | url= | title=Trying to Get People to See 'Veil' | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for ''The Painted Veil''. When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds' worth.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

===Writing===
Screenwriter [[Ron Nyswaner]] and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film.  The 1925 novel by author [[W. Somerset Maugham]] was considered one-dimensional, so Norton altered the story so the character Walter Fane had a more enhanced role.  The character was also rewritten to make his peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other.  Norton explained, "I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it.  We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel."  Norton described the novel as "almost unremittingly bleak" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change.  The actor explained of the change to the story, "I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  Norton considered ''The Painted Veil'' to be in the spirit of films like ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996), seeing it as "rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other".&lt;ref name=passion/&gt;

Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at [[Yale University]], agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian [[Jonathan Spence]]'s 1969 book ''To Change China'', which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as "the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism", explaining about Fane's confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, "Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;

===Filming===
Filming took place on location in [[Shanghai, China]]. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao Ancient Town (黄姚古镇 - huáng yáo gǔ zhèn) in [[Guangxi]] Zhuang Autonomous Region, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, "Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time." According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt; Most of the film was shot in [[Guangxi]]. Director John Curran commented, "We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]] or [[Italy]]." After a search of location in [[Hunan]] province, the scouts chose the location in Guangxi  for the film. Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot "Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well."

===Music===
The official soundtrack is composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/title/tracks.asp?paintedveil | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | publisher=[[the SoundtrackINFO Project]] | accessdate=2011-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The film's post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November.  According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of [[Warner Independent Pictures]], the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so ''The Painted Veil'' was unable to get first priority in processing. When ''The Painted Veil'' experienced a limited release in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006 in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused half a dozen people associated with the film to complain about how [[Warner Independent Pictures]] was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic [[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote, "Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops."&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

The firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of ''The Painted Veil'' who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] explained about the move to Warner Independent, "Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed." Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. ''The Painted Veil'' was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of ''The Painted Veil'' in Los Angeles, New York, [[San Francisco]], and [[London]], as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
''The Painted Veil'' initially had a [[limited release]] in four theaters in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend.  The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and [[Canada]], peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) - Weekend Box Office Results | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Painted Veil'' ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a worldwide total of $22,586,391.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the film review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Painted Veil'' has received a 74% 'fresh' rating based on 143 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/painted_veil/ | title=The Painted Veil | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the similar website [[Metacritic]], the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/paintedveil | title=Painted Veil, The (2006): Reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the story seems "so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from [[Edna Ferber]]. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff [[bildungsroman]] into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/movies/20veil.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film "has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary [[E.M. Forster]], the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-painted20dec20,0,7424259.story |title='&amp;#39;Los Angeles Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Calendarlive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and commented, "If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a [[period piece]] propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . ''The Painted Veil'' has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-painted-veil-20061212 |title='&amp;#39;Rolling Stone'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meghan Keane of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said the film "may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audience's intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/letting-love-blossom-in-the-face-of-disease/45494/ |title='&amp;#39;New York Sun'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought the story "feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked." He added, "Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . . Even the ultra-capable Norton and Watts aren't fully able to galvanize viewer interest in their narrowly self-absorbed characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mccarthy |first=Todd |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117932311.html?nav=reviews07&amp;categoryid=2352&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |title='&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Variety.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] won the 2006 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/year/2006 | title=The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2007) | publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Desplat also won an award for Best Original Score from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] for both ''The Painted Veil'' and ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafca.net/Home/News/2006_lafca_awards_winners.html | title=2006 LAFCA Awards | publisher=[[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132335/http://lafca.net/Home/News/2006_lafca_awards_winners.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Nyswaner]] won the [[National Board of Review Awards 2006|National Board of Review Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay]] but lost to [[Jason Reitman]] for ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]''.

[[Edward Norton]] was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]] but lost to [[Ryan Gosling]] in ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]''. The [[San Diego Film Critics Society]] honored him for his work in this and ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'' and ''[[Down in the Valley (film)|Down in the Valley]]''.

'''''Tobias and the Angel''''' is an [[altar]] [[painting]], finished around 1470–1475,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio &amp;#124; Tobias and the Angel &amp;#124; NG781 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/workshop-of-andrea-del-verrocchio-tobias-and-the-angel|website=The National Gallery|publisher=The National Gallery|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the workshop of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Michael|title=The National Gallery, London|date=1977|publisher=Orbis Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-85613-314-0|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[National Gallery]], [[London]]. This painting is similar to an earlier painting depicting Tobias and the Angel, by [[Antonio del Pollaiolo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=David Allan|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0-300-07246-5|pages=47–50|title=Leonardo da Vinci: Origins of a Genius-David Alan Brown- Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z34SeyFWV8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oxford art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was a member of Verrocchio's studio, may have painted some part of this work, most likely the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemp|first1=Martin|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958335-5|page=251|title=Leonardo: Revised Edition-Martin Kemp-Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyFgNvsYNc0C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=martin+kemp+tobias+and+the+angel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5HimilzlhH&amp;sig=nnkn6ud78dxwd4ULFx2x-6pCdL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jZJqVYHQLYXCggTKxYCYCw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20kemp%20tobias%20and%20the%20angel&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Alan Brown, of the National Gallery in Washington, attributes the painting of the fluffy little dog to him as well.

The '''''Wheat Fields''''' is a series of dozens of paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]], borne out of his religious studies and sermons, connection to nature, appreciation of manual laborers and desire to provide a means of offering comfort to others.  The wheat field works demonstrate his progression as an artist from the drab ''Wheat Sheaves'' made in 1885 in the [[Netherlands]] to the colorful, dramatic paintings from [[Arles]], [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] and [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] of rural [[France]].

==Wheat as a subject==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Geploegde akkers ('De voren') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Ploughed fields ('The furrows''') – depicts the fields before the wheat grows. Van Gogh appreciated manual laborers and their connection to nature.]] &lt;!-- MAY BE REMOVE IF NOT LIKED, BUT THERE IS AN OTHER IN ARTICLE WITH PLOW --&gt;
Failing to find a vocation in ministry, Van Gogh turned to art as a means to express and communicate his deepest sense of the meaning of life.  Cliff Edwards, author of ''Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest'' wrote:  "Vincent's life was a quest for unification, a search for how to integrate the ideas of religion, art, literature, and nature that motivated him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=77 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh came to view painting as a calling, "I feel a certain indebtedness [to the world] and ... out of gratitude, want to leave some souvenir in the shape of drawings or pictures – not made to please a certain taste in art, but to express a sincere feeling."&lt;ref name="Wallace calling"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=37  | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Van Gogh left [[Paris]] for [[Arles]], he sought an antidote to the ills of city life and work among laborers in the field "giving his art and life the value he recognized in rural toil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=1999 | page=82 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series of paintings about wheat fields, Van Gogh expresses through symbolism and use of color his deeply felt spiritual beliefs, appreciation of manual laborers and connection to nature.

===Spiritual significance===
As a young man Van Gogh pursued what he saw as a religious calling, wanting to minister to working people.  In 1876 he was assigned a post in [[Isleworth]], [[England]] to teach [[Bible]] classes and occasionally preach in the [[Methodist]] church.&lt;ref name="LeeuwSp"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Letters of Vincent van Gogh |author1=Van Gogh, V  |author2=Leeuw, R  |lastauthoramp=yes | editor=van Crimpen, H |editor2=Berends-Albert, M. | publisher=Penguin Books | location=London and other locations | year=1997 | origyear=1996 | page= | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace 2"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | editor= of Time-Life Books | author=Wallace | publisher=Time=Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA | year=1969 | pages=12–15| isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the [[Netherlands]] he studied for the [[Christian ministry|ministry]] and also for [[lay ministry]] or [[missionary]] work without finishing either field of study.  With support from his father, Van Gogh went to [[Borinage]] in southern [[Belgium]] where he nursed and ministered to coal miners.  There he obtained a six-month trial position for a small salary where he preached in an old dance hall and established and taught Bible school. His self-imposed zeal and [[asceticism]] cost him the position.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2"/&gt;

After a nine-month period of withdrawal from society and family; he rejected the church establishment, yet found his personal vision of [[spirituality]], "The best way to know God is to love many things.  Love a friend, a wife, something - whatever you like - (and) you will be on the way to knowing more about Him; this is what I say to myself. But one must love with a lofty and serious intimate sympathy, with strength, with intelligence."&lt;ref name="Wallace 2"/&gt;  By 1879, he made a shift in the direction of his life and found he could express his "love of God and man" through painting.&lt;ref name="LeeuwSp"/&gt;

Drawn to Biblical parables, Van Gogh found wheat fields metaphors for humanity's cycles of life, as both celebration of growth and realization of the susceptibility of nature's powerful forces.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;

* Of the Biblical symbolism of sowing and reaping Van Gogh taught in his Bible lessons: "One does not expect to get from life what one has already learned it cannot give; rather, one begins to see more clearly that life is a kind of sowing time, and the harvest is not here."&lt;ref name="Erickson33"/&gt;
* [[File:The Sower - painting by Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''The Sower,'' June 1888, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], Otterlo. Inspired by [[Jean-François Millet]] Van Gogh made several paintings after ''The Sower'' by Millet]] The image of the sower came to Van Gogh in Biblical teachings from his childhood, such as:
:"A sower went out to sow. As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.  Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.  Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.  And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty fold, and sixty fold and a hundredfold.(Mark 4:3-8)&lt;ref name="Erickson33"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

===Field workers===
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Peasant woman binding sheaves (after Millet) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|Vincent van Gogh - ''Peasant woman binding sheaves (after Millet)'']]
The "peasant genre" that greatly influenced Van Gogh began in the 1840s with the works of [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Jules Breton]], and others. In 1885 Van Gogh described the painting of peasants as the most essential contribution to modern art. He described the works of Millet and Breton of religious significance, "something on high," and described them as the "voices of the wheat."&lt;ref name="van Heugten"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night | author=van Gogh, V, van Heugten, S, Pissarro, J, Stolwijk, C  | publisher=Mercatorfonds with Van Gogh Museum and Museum of Modern Art | location=Brusells | year=2008 | pages=12, 25 | isbn=978-0-87070-736-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PipnXcXe5TQC&amp;pg=PA12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Van Gogh's adulthood he had an interest in serving others, especially manual workers.  As a young man he served and ministered to coal miners in [[Borinage]], [[Belgium]] which seemed to bring him close to his calling of being a missionary or minister to workers.&lt;ref name="Wallace workers"/&gt;

A common denominator in his favored authors and artists was sentimental treatment of the destitute and downtrodden.  Referring to painting of peasants Van Gogh wrote to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]: "How shall I ever manage to paint what I love so much?"  He held laborers up to a high standard of how dedicatedly he should approach painting, "One must undertake with confidence, with a certain assurance that one is doing a reasonable thing, like the farmer who drives his plow... (one who) drags the [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] behind himself.  If one hasn't a horse, one is one's own horse."&lt;ref name="Wallace workers"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=10, 14, 21, 30  | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to nature===
Van Gogh used nature for inspiration, preferring that to abstract studies from imagination.  He wrote that rather than making abstract studies: "I am getting well acquainted with nature.  I exaggerate, sometime I make change in motif; but for all that, I do not invent the whole picture; on the contrary, I find it already in nature, only it must be disentangled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | pages=103–104 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"/&gt; Van Gogh saw plowing, sowing and harvesting symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature: "the sower and the wheat sheaf stood for eternity, and the reaper and his [[scythe]] for irrevocable death." The dark hours conducive to germination and regeneration are depicted in ''The Sower'' and wheat fields at sunset.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"/&gt;

[[File:Wheat close-up.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Wheat]]]]In 1889 Van Gogh wrote of the way in which wheat was symbolic to him: "What can a person do when he thinks of all the things he cannot understand, but look at the fields of wheat... We, who live by bread, are we not ourselves very much like wheat... to be reaped when we are ripe."&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van |title=Landscape at Saint-Rémy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher= |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh saw in his paintings of wheat fields an opportunity for people to find a sense of calm and meaning, offering more to suffering people than guessing at what they may learn "on the other side of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=111 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/597.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh Saint-Rémy, 2 July 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh writes Theo that he hopes that his family brings to him "what nature, clods of earth, the grass, yellow wheat, the peasant, are for me, in other words, that you find in your love for people something not only to work for, but to comfort and restore you when there is a need."&lt;ref name="Leeuw 605"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Letters of Vincent van Gogh |author1=Van Gogh, V  |author2=Leeuw, R  |lastauthoramp=yes | editor=van Crimpen, H |editor2=Berends-Albert, M. | publisher=Penguin Books | location=London and other locations | year=1997 | origyear=1996 | page=F605 | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further exploring the connection between man and nature, Van Gogh wrote his sister Wil, "What the [[germination|germinating]] force is in a grain of wheat, love is in us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=78 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times Van Gogh was so enamored with nature that his sense of self seemed lost in the intensity of his work: "I have a terrible lucidity at moments, these days when nature is so beautiful, I am not conscious of myself any more, and the picture comes to me as in a dream."&lt;ref name="Edwards102"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=102 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
Wheat fields provided a subject in which Van Gogh could experiment with color.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt;  Tired of his work in the Netherlands made with dull, gray colors, van Gogh sought to create work that was more creative and colorful.&lt;ref name="Lubin74"/&gt; In Paris Van Gogh met leading French artists [[Edgar Degas]], [[Georges Seurat]] and others who provided illuminating influences on the use of color and technique.  His work, previously somber and dark, now "blazed with color." His use of color was so dramatic that Van Gogh was sometimes called an [[Expressionist]].&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Basic History of Art | author=H. W. Janson | publisher=Harry N. Abrams | location=New York | year=1971 | chapter=The Modern World | page=308 | isbn=0-13-389296-4 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Van Gogh learned much about color and technique in Paris, southern France provided an opportunity to express his "surging emotions."&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt;  Enlightened by the effects of the sun drenched countryside in southern France, Van Gogh reported that above all, his work "promises color."&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;  This is where he began development of his masterpieces.&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt;

Van Gogh used [[complementary colors|complementary, contrasting colors]] to bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work.  Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and contrast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness | author=Fell, D | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | location=New York | year=2005 | origyear=2004 | page=64 | isbn=0-7867-1655-X | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqSjxGgvVMMC&amp;pg=PA64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of "a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls."&lt;ref name="Silverman326"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art | author=Silverman, D | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location=New York | year=2000 | page=326 | isbn=0-374-28243-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8c9jt9AToD0C&amp;pg=PA326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of use of complementary colors is ''The Sower'' where gold is contrasted to purple and blue with orange to intensify the impact of the work.&lt;ref name="Erickson99"/&gt;

The four [[seasons]] were reflected in lime green and silver of spring, yellow when the wheat matured, beige and then burnished gold.&lt;ref name="Fell"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Gardens | author=Fell, D | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=United Kingdom | year=2001 | page=43 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periods==

===Nuenen and Paris===
Prior to Van Gogh's exploration of southern [[France]], there were just a few of his paintings where wheat was the subject.

The first, ''Sheaves of Wheat in a Field'' was painted July–August 1885 in [[Nuenen]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20102.692/Sheaves-of-wheat |title=Sheaves of Wheat in a Field |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the emphasis is on the land and labor is suggested by the "bulging wheat stacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Progress: Utopia, Modernity, and Late-Nineteenth-Century Art | author=Zemel, C | publisher= | location= | year= | page=229 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2gWfmFn0_QC&amp;pg=PP229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was made several months after ''[[The Potato Eaters]]'' at a time when he was looking to free himself physically, emotionally and artistically from the gray colors of his art and life, moving away from Nuenen to develop, as author Albert Lubin describes, a more "imaginative, colorful art that suited him much better."&lt;ref name="Lubin74"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stranger on the Earth: A Psychological Biography of Vincent van Gogh | author=Lubin, A | publisher=De Capo Press | location=United States | year=1996 | origyear=1972 | pages=74–75 | isbn=0-306-80726-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHVwceHVI5cC&amp;pg=PR74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh, who "particularly admired a poem written by [[Walt Whitman]] about the beauty in a blade of grass", began painting waving stalks of wheat in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Fell40"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Gardens | author=Fell, D | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=United Kingdom | year=2001 | page=40 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1887, he made ''[[Wheat Field with a Lark]]'' where [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] influences are reflected in his use of color and management of light and shadow. Brush strokes are made to reflect the objects, like the stalks of wheat.&lt;ref name="VGG WF Lark"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Wheat Field with a Lark |year= |work= |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace WF Lark"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=49 | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work reflects the motion of the wheat blowing in the wind, the lark flying and the clouds streaking from the currents in the sky.  The cycles of life are reflected in the land left by harvested wheat and the growing wheat subject to the forces of the wind, as we are subject to the pressures in our lives.  The cycle of life depicted here is both tragic and comforting.  The stubble of the harvested wheat reflect the inevitable cycle of death, while the stalks of wheat, flying bird and windswept clouds reflect continual change.&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin| first1=N | last1=Maurer | first2=V | last2=van Gogh | first3=P | last3=Gauguin | publisher=Associated University Press | location=Canbury and other locations | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=57 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Edge of a Wheat Field with Poppies,'' shown below in black and white, was also painted in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/105/Edge-of-a-Wheatfield-with-Poppies.html |title=Edge of a Wheat Field with Poppies |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Arles===
Van Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France.  There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as ''Harvest at La Crau.''  The [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflower paintings]], some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time.  He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings.  This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.  He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;

In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], he wrote, "Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color." As a means of explanation, Van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Arts Entwined: Music and Painting in the Nineteenth Century | first1=M | last1=Morton | first2=P | last2=Schmunk |  publisher=Garland Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | isbn=0-8153-3156-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NP724mFE1MC&amp;pg=PA177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific time, in less than 444 days van Gogh made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings.  Yet, he still found time and energy to write more than 200 letters.  While he painted quickly, mindful of the pace farmers would need to work in the hot sun, he spent time thinking about his paintings long before he put brush to canvas.&lt;ref name="NGA Sun"&gt;{{cite journal |year= |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |volume= |issue= |pages=18 |publisher=National Gallery of Art | location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as [[Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]] and Japanese art (see [[Japonism]]).  His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, [[impasto]] brush strokes.&lt;ref name="Honolulu"/&gt;

====May farmhouses====

====June - ''The Sower''====
[[File:The Sower - painting by Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|160px|''The Sower,'' June 1888, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], [[Netherlands]] (F422) ]]The audience is drawn into the painting by the glowing disk of the rising sun in citron-yellow which Van Gogh intended to represent the [[divinity|divine]], replicating the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] from [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''Christ Asleep during the Tempest.''  Van Gogh depicts the cycle of life in the sowing of wheat against the field of mature wheat,&lt;ref name="Erickson99"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B. Eerdsman Publishing | location=Grand Rapids, MI | year=1998 | page=99 | isbn=0-8028-3856-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz0Pla9mLSYC&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  there is death, like the setting sun, but also rebirth.  The sun will rise again.  Wheat has been cut, but the sower plants seeds for a new crop.  Leaves have fallen from the tree in the distance, but leaves will grow again.&lt;ref name="Lubin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stranger on the Earth: A Psychological Biography of Vincent van Gogh | author=Lubin, A | publisher=De Capo Press | location=United States | year=1996 | origyear=1972 | page=17 | isbn=0-306-80726-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHVwceHVI5cC&amp;pg=PR17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sower'', Van Gogh uses [[complementary colors]] to bring intensity to the picture. Blue and orange flecks in the plowed field and violet and gold in the spring wheat behind the sower.&lt;ref name="Erickson99"/&gt;  Van Gogh used colors symbolically and for effect, when speaking of the colors in this work he said: ''I couldn't care less what the colours are in reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/B07.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Emile Bernard Arles, c. 18 June 1888 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by [[Jean-François Millet]] van Gogh made several paintings after ''The Sower'' by Millet. Van Gogh made seven other "Sower" paintings, one in 1883 and the other six after this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog  |title=Van Gogh Catalog |year= |work= |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 10, 2011 | postscript=enter "sower" in the name field and "p" in the type field. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====June - Harvest====
During the last half of June he worked on a group of ten "Harvest" paintings,&lt;ref name="Honolulu"/&gt; which allowed him to experiment with color and technique. "I have now spent a week working hard in the wheatfields, under the blazing sun," Van Gogh wrote on 21 June 1888 to his brother Theo.&lt;ref name="VGM WF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2595&amp;lang=en |title=Wheat Fields |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the series of wheat fields as "…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping."&lt;ref name="NGA Sun"/&gt;

''Wheat Fields'' also ''Wheat Fields with the Alpilles Foothills in the Background''&lt;ref name="VGM WF"/&gt; is a view of the vast, spreading plain against a low horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=1999 | page=87 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly the entire canvas is filled with the wheat field.  In the foreground is green wheat of yellow, green, red, brown and black colors, which sets off the more mature, golden yellow wheat.  The [[Alpilles]] range is just visible in the distance.&lt;ref name="VGM WF"/&gt;

Van Gogh wrote about ''Sunset: Wheat Fields Near Arles'':  "A summer sun... town purple, celestial body yellow, sky green-blue.  The wheat has all the hues of old gold, copper, green-gold or red-gold, yellow gold, yellow bronze, red-green."  He made this work during the height of the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] winds.  To prevent his canvas from flying away, van Gogh drove the easel into the ground and secured the canvas to the easel with rope.&lt;ref name="Leeuw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/604/Sunset:-Wheat-Fields-Near-Arles.html |title=Sunset: Wheat Fields near Arles |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the figure "the reaper" Van Gogh expressed his symbolic, spiritual view of those who worked close to nature in a letter to his sister in 1889:  "aren’t we, who live on bread, to a considerable extent like wheat, at least aren't we forced to submit to growing like a plant without the power to move, by which I mean in whatever way our imagination impels us, and to being reaped when we are ripe, like the same wheat?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toledomuseum.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Big_names.pdf |title=Wheat Field with Reapers, Auvers |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Toledo Museum of Art |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====June - complimentary harvest paintings====
''Harvest,'' named by Van Gogh himself, or ''Harvest at La Crau, with [[Montmajour Abbey|Montmajour]] in the Background'' is made in horizontal planes.  The harvested wheat lies in the foreground. In the center the activities for harvest are represented by the haystack, ladders, carts and a man with a pitchfork.  The background is purple-blue mountains against a turquoise sky. He was interested in depicting "the essence of country life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2607&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=The Harvest, 1888 |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June Van Gogh wrote of the landscape at [[La Crau]] that it was "beautiful and endless as the sea."  One of his most important works, the landscape reminded him of paintings by 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Ruysdael]] and [[Philip de Koninck|Philips Koninck]].&lt;ref name="Leeuw"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Letters of Vincent van Gogh |author1=Van Gogh, V  |author2=Leeuw, R  |lastauthoramp=yes | editor=van Crimpen, H |editor2=Berends-Albert, M. | publisher=Penguin Books | location=London and other locations | year=1997 | origyear=1996 | page=F497 | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compared this work favorably with his painting ''The White Orchard.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/497.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh Arles, 12 or 13 June 1888 |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Webexhibits |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the year, he painted about 150 canvases.&lt;ref name="Met Article"/&gt;

====The Wheat Field====
{{main|The Wheat Field}}
Van Gogh worked on a group of paintings  of [[The Wheat Field|group of paintings of the wheat field]] that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital.  From the studio room he could see a field of wheat, enclosed by a wall.  Beyond that were the mountains from Arles.  During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains.&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/82820.html?mulR=32251%7c1 |title=Rain |year=2011 |work=Collections |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, "Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=104 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.&lt;ref name="Fell40"/&gt;

}}The wheat field with cypresses paintings were made when van Gogh was able to leave the asylum. Van Gogh had a fondness for cypresses and wheat fields of which he wrote: "Only I have no news to tell you, for the days are all the same, I have no ideas, except to think that a field of wheat or a cypress well worth the trouble of looking at closeup."&lt;ref name="Edwards102" /&gt;

In early July, Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo of a work he began in June, ''[[Wheat Field with Cypresses]]'': "I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto . . . and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too." Van Gogh who regarded this landscape as one of his "best" summer paintings made two additional oil paintings very similar in composition that fall.  One of the two is in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/wheat_field_with_cypresses_vincent_van_gogh/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110000977 |title=Wheat Field with Cypresses |year=2000–2011 |work= |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[National Gallery]] ''A Wheat Field, with Cypresses'' painting was made in September&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-a-wheatfield-with-cypresses |title=A Wheat Field, with Cypresses |year= |work=Collection, Vincent van Gogh |publisher=National Gallery, London |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which author H.W. Janson describes: "the field is like a stormy sea; the trees spring flamelike from the ground; and the hills and clouds heave with the same surge of motion.  Every stroke stands out boldly in a long ribbon of strong, unmixed color."&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt;

There is also another version of ''Wheat Fields with Cypresses'' made in September with a blue-green sky, reportedly held at the [[Tate Gallery]] in London (F743).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/748/Wheat-Field-with-Cypresses.html |title=Wheat Field with Cypresses |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other wheat field paintings====
Van Gogh describes the ripening ''[[Green Wheat Field with Cypress]]'' painted in June: "a field of wheat turning yellow, surrounded by blackberry bushes and green shrubs. At the end of the field there is a little house with a tall somber cypress which stands out against the far-off hills with their violet-like and bluish tones, and against a sky the colour of forget-me-nots with pink streaks, whose pure hues form a contrast with the scorched ears, which are already heavy, and have the warm tones of a bread crust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W12.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 16 June 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auvers-sur-Oise===
[[File:Gogh, Vincent van - Cottages.jpg|thumb|160px|right|''Thatched Cottages,'' 1890, [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]], [[St. Petersburg]], Russia]]In May 1890, Van Gogh traveled from [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] to [[Paris]],&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; where he had a three-day stay with his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Theo's wife [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]] and their new baby Vincent.  Van Gogh found that unlike his past experiences in Paris, he was no longer used to the commotion of the city&lt;ref name="Leeuw"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Letters of Vincent van Gogh | author=Leeuw, R | publisher=Penguin Group | location=London and other locations | year=1997 | origyear=1996 | pages=488, 490, 491 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyX5lfrof6oC&amp;pg=PA329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was too agitated to paint.  His brother, Theo and artist [[Camille Pissarro]] developed a plan for Van Gogh to go to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] with a letter of introduction for Dr. [[Paul Gachet]],&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=162–163 | isbn= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a homeopathic physician and art patron who lived in Auvers.&lt;ref name="Strieter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nineteenth-Century European Art: A Topical Dictionary | author=Strieter, T | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport | year=1999 | page=17| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDr7Tbk__1kC&amp;pg=PA17 | isbn=0-313-29898-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh had a room at the inn Auberge Ravoux in Auvers&lt;ref name="Leeuw"/&gt; and was under the care and supervision of Dr. Gachet with whom he grew to have a close relationship, "something like another brother."&lt;ref name="Leeuw"/&gt;

For a time, Van Gogh seemed to improve.  He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings.."&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/vangogh/vangogh-46505.html |title=Girl in White, 1890 |year=2011 | work=The Collection |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as [[The Church at Auvers]], portraits, and the nearby fields.&lt;ref name="Leeuw"/&gt;

Van Gogh arrived in Auvers in late spring as pea plants and wheat fields on gently sloping hills ripened for harvest.  The area bustled as migrant workers from France and Brussels descended on the area for the harvest.  Partial to rural life, Van Gogh strongly portrayed the beauty of the Auvers country side.  He wrote his brother, "I have one study of old thatched roofs with a field of peas in flower in the foreground and some wheat, the background of hills, a study which I think you will like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Table: At the Auberge Ravoux | first1=A | last1=Leaf | first2=F | last2=Lebain |  publisher=Artisan | location=New York | year=2001 | page=136 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBxJtWUz-CoC&amp;pg=PA136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wheat harvest series====
Van Gogh painted thirteen large canvases of horizontal landscapes of the wheat harvest that occurs in the region from the middle to late July. The series began with ''Wheat Field under Cloudy Sky'' then ''[[Wheatfield with Crows]]'' was painted when the crop was on the verge of harvest.  ''Sheaves of Wheat'' painted after the harvest and concluding with "Field with Haystacks" (private collection).&lt;ref name="Dallas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dallasmuseumofart.org |title=Sheaves of Wheat |date= |work=Collections |publisher=Dallas Museum of Art |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is mainly a large green field of wheat.  In the background is a white house behind a wall and a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/21/W23.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Auvers-sur-Oise, c. 12 June 1890  | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh described ''Ears of Wheat'' to painter and friend [[Paul Gauguin]] as "nothing more than ears of wheat, green-blue stalks long, ribbon-like leaves, under a sheen of green &amp; pink; ears of wheat, yellowing slightly, with an edge made pale pink by the dusty manner of flowering; at the bottom, a pink bindweed winding round a stalk. I would like to paint portraits against a background that is so lively and yet so still."  The painting depicts "the soft rustle of the ears of grain swaying back and forth in the wind."  He used the motif as the background to a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3251&amp;lang=en |title=Ears of Wheat |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fields'' was painted in July and held in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/137/Fields,-The.html |title=The Fields |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An animated ''Wheatfield with Cornflowers'' shows the effect of a gust of wind that ripples through the yellow stalks, seeming to "overflow" into the blue background.  The heads of a few stalks of wheat seem to have detached themselves, diving into the blue of the hills in the background.&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/vincent-van-gogh |title=Vincent van Gogh |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher=Fondation Beyeler |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh brings the spectator directly into ''Sheaves of Wheat'' by filling the picture plane with eight sheaves of wheat, as if seeing it from a worker's perspective. The sheaves, bathed in yellow light, appear to be recently cut.  For contrast, Van Gogh uses the complementary, vivid lavender for shadows and earth in the nearby field.&lt;ref name="Dallas"/&gt;

In van Gogh's ''Wheatfields Under Thunderclouds,'' also called ''Wheat Fields Under Clouded Sky,'' landscape he depicts the loneliness of the countryside and the degree to which it was "healthy and heartening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=4596&amp;lang=en |title=Wheatfields under Thunderclouds |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s ''[[Wheatfield with Crows]]'' was made in July 1890, in the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life, many have claimed it was his last work.  Others have claimed ''Tree Roots'' was his last painting.  ''Wheatfield with Crows,'' made on an elongated canvas, depicts a dramatic cloudy sky filled with crows over a wheat field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3343&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Wheatfield with Crows |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind-swept wheat field fills two thirds of the canvas.  An empty path pulls the audience into the painting.  Jules Michelet, one of Van Gogh's favorite authors, wrote of the crow: "They interest themselves in everything, and observe everything.  The ancients, who lived far more completely than ourselves in and with nature, found it no small profit to follow, in a hundred obscure things where human experience as yet affords no light, the directions so prudent and sage a bird."  Of making the painting Van Gogh wrote that he did not have a hard time depicting the sadness and emptiness of the painting, which was powerfully offset by the restorative nature of the countryside.&lt;ref name="Edwards149"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | pages=78, 186 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erickson, author of ''Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision of Vincent van Gogh'', cautious of attributing stylistic changes in his work to mental illness, finds the painting expresses both the sorrow and the sense of his life coming to an end.&lt;ref name="Erickson103"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

The road, in contrasting colors of red and green, is thought to be a metaphor for a sermon he gave based on Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' where the pilgrim is sorrowful that the road is so long, yet rejoicing because the Eternal City waits at the journey's end.&lt;ref name="Erickson162"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

''Field with Stacks of Grain,'' at [[Beyeler Foundation]], Riehen, Switzerland (F809) is one of van Gogh’s very last paintings, is both more rigid and at the same time more abstract than other paintings of this series, such as ''Wheatfield with Cornflowers.'' Two large stacks of wheat fill the painting like "abandoned buildings," seeming to cut off the sky.&lt;ref name="FB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/136/Field-with-Wheat-Stacks.html|title=Field with Stacks of Grain |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wheat Fields with Auvers in the Background'' also painted in July is part of the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire collection in Geneva (F801).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/756/Wheat-Fields-with-Auvers-in-the-Background.html |title=Wheat Fields with Auvers in the Background |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emotional turmoil====
From Wallace,&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; "But for all his appearance of a renewed well-being his life was very near its end." Illness struck Theo's baby, Vincent. Theo had both health and employment issues; he considered leaving his employer and starting his own business.  Gachet, said to have his own eccentricities and neurosis, caused van Gogh concern to which he questioned: "Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both end up in the ditch?"&lt;ref name="Leeuw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

After visiting Paris for a family conference, Van Gogh returned to Auvers feeling more bleak.  In a letter he wrote, "And the prospect grows darker, I see no future at all."&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

He later had a period where he said that "the trouble I had in my head has considerably calmed...I am completely absorbed in that immense plain covered with fields of wheat against the hills boundless as the sea in delicate colors of yellow and green, the pale violet of the plowed and weeded earth checkered at regular intervals with the green of the flowering potato plants, everything under a sky of delicate blue, white, pink, and violet. I am almost too calm, a state that is necessary to paint all that."

Four days after completing ''Wheat Fields after the Rain'' he shot himself in the Auvers wheat fields.  Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890.&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt;
