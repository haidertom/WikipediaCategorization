'''''A Woman Preparing Bread and Butter for a Boy''''' (1660-1663) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Getty Center]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "10. A WOMAN CUTTING BREAD AND BUTTER FOR A BOY, WHO IS SAYING GRACE. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 54; deG. 48.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a room with a window at the back sits a woman, wearing a dark jacket and a blue skirt. She has a loaf of bread in her left hand, and is taking a piece of butter from a plate on a chair at her left. To her right stands a boy with folded hands, clasping his hat to his breast. The room is in subdued light. The open half-door of a passage with tiled floor beyond looks on the street ; the ground before a house opposite is illumined by sunshine. Although the picture has not the brilliant effect so much esteemed, it is a very pleasing and satisfactory example.

The  '''''Adoration of the Magi''''' or '''''Uffizi Triptych''''' is a group of three tempera-on-panel paintings by [[Andrea Mantegna]], dating to around 1460. Their three subjects are the ''[[Ascension of Christ]]'' (86 by 42.5&amp;nbsp;cm), ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' the largest and central panel (76 by 76.5&amp;nbsp;cm) and the ''[[Circumcision of Christ]]'' (86 by 42.5&amp;nbsp;cm). They were gathered as a trio in the 19th century, although some art historians doubt that they were created as a [[triptych]] set in the way they are now arranged. They are now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].

==History==
Most scholars agree the three works were commissioned in the 1460s for [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]]'s private chapel in the [[Castello di San Giorgio|Castle of St. George]] in [[Mantua]] (together with the [[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|''Death of the Virgin'']], now in the [[Museo del Prado]], and ''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]'', now in [[Ferrara]]). The paintings for the chapel are mentioned in two letters from Mantegna to Ludovico dated April 1464 and in [[Vasari]] as "a painting [by Mantegna], in which are scenes with small but very beautiful figures ... in the castle at Mantua, for the chapel".

Other scholars such as Fiocco argue that there is no evidence for how the three works got from Mantua to Florence and that they were instead produced in Tuscany during one of Mantegna's two trips there in 1466 and 1467. Stylistic reasons, however, link the work to Mantegna's final period in Padua, which ended in 1459, rather than to his maturity in Mantua.

The first secure reference to the three paintings dates to 1587, when it was found cut up in Valle Muggia near [[Pistoia]] among the belongings of [[Don Antonio de' Medici]]. They were inherited before in 1632 entering the collection of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], where the ''Adoration'' was misattributed to [[Botticelli]]. The three works were exhibited together from 1827, with a gilded new neo-Renaissance intaglio frame which compensated for the differing sizes of the central work and the side panels.

Most modern critics note the differences between the three works, including their form, format, setting and quality, especially between the ''Circumcision'' and the other two works. [[Roberto Longhi]] doubted that the three works were conceived as a single unified triptych and theorised that instead they all came from different locations in the same chapel, as did ''[[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|Death of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]''. According to Longhi, ''Circumcision'' replaced ''Death of the Virgin'' when it was decided to limit the scheme solely to scenes from Christ's life.

==Adoration==
[[File:Andrea Mantegna 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Adoration]]
The panel was probably located in the chapel's apse. The Magi are depicted while descending to the Child's grotto from a path carved out in the rock. The Virgin is portrayed with a crown of angels, according to a [[byzantine art|Byzantine]] model.

Another version of the painting sold for the then record price of $10.5 million in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Los Angeles Times - Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of fiction, '''apocrypha''' includes stories and works set in a fictional universe that do not belong in its [[canon (fiction)|canon]] but may still have some authority within it. The boundaries between canon and apocrypha can often be blurry.

Apocrypha may include tie-in merchandise, such as video games, novels and comics, which is often referred to as the fictional universe's '[[Expanded Universe|expanded universe]]'.

At times, apocryphal material may contradict the continuity that has already been established by canon. Even when no such contradictions occur, such material may sometimes be deemed apocrypha if it has been produced independently of the universe's creator. For example, [[Buffyverse]] creator [[Joss Whedon]] has little involvement with Buffyverse [[Buffyverse novels|novels]], has never closely overseen or edited one, and has never read an entire novel through.

[[Star Trek canon]] consists of the Star Trek television series and movies. All other Star Trek novels and comics, whether licensed by Paramount or not, are not part of canon, but are classified as apocrypha. 

Fan fiction is referred to as [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]].

==Etymology==
The word derives the Greek word '{{lang|el|απόκρυφα}}, which means ''opened, revealed,'' or ''uncovered''. [[Jerome]] coined the term to refer to those books of the [[Old Testament]] that were not found in the Hebrew Tanakh, and it has since been used to describe religious texts that may not belong to the [[Biblical canon|canon]].

The term is used in nonreligious contexts. An account or anecdote is said to be apocryphal if its authenticity or veracity is questionable.

'''Art in modern Scotland''' includes all aspects of the [[visual arts]] in the country since the beginning of the twentieth century. In the early twentieth century, the art scene was dominated by the work of the members of the [[Glasgow School]] known as the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of [[Celtic revival]], [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. They were followed by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. There was a growing interest in forms of [[Modernism]], with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].

Scotland possess significant collections of art, like the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]] and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in [[Glasgow]]. Prominent schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in the country is Creative Scotland. Support is also provided by local councils and independent foundations.

==Early twentieth century==

===Glasgow School===
{{Main|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', 1909, by [[Frances Macdonald]]]]
For the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The most important grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the [[Celtic Revival]], the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish Colourists===
{{Main|Scottish Colourists}}
[[File:Samuel John Peploe, The Coffee Pot, 1905.jpg|thumb|''The Coffee Pot'', by [[Samuel Peploe]] (1905)]]
The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was retrospectively given to [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group.

Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and looked for inspiration to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= |archiveurl=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |archivedate=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Fergusson in particular would later be a major influence on bringing modernism to Scottish art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

===Edinburgh School===
{{Main|The Edinburgh School}}
The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the [[First World War]], became known as the Edinburgh School,&lt;ref name=EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School "The Edinburgh School"], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom belonged to the informal 1922 Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/1922-group, retrieved 7 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"&gt;D.

Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 153–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form.&lt;ref name=EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool/&gt; Members included [[William George Gillies|William Gillies]] (1898–1973), who focused on landscapes and still life, [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]] (1905–62) who created both landscapes and studies of imaginative subjects, [[William Geissler]] (1894-1963),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.s-s-a.org/presidents-and-secretaries/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsw.org.uk/pages/past_members.php?pageNum_rsPastMembers=10&amp;totalRows_rsPastMembers=313&lt;/ref&gt; watercolourist of landscapes in Perthshire, East Lothian and Hampshire,&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Art of William Geissler (1894-1963): Norman Shaw, MPhil Thesis, Edinburgh College of Art, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Art of William Geissler 1894-1963, Poetry of Place, Author: Alistair (Introduction) Rowan, Publisher: Edinburgh College of Art, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Crozier (Scottish artist)|William Crozier]] (1893–1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours, [[William MacTaggart]] (1903–81), noted for his landscapes of East Lothian, France and Norway&lt;ref name=EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool/&gt; and [[Anne Redpath]] (1895–1965), best known for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects.&lt;ref name=Roseetal2012p25/&gt;

===Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance===
{{See also|Modernism|Scottish Renaissance}}
[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''Regatta'' (1913)]]
The philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in his magazine ''Evergreen''. He argued that technological development needed to be in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970), [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981) and Fergusson.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930.&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal ''Scottish Art and Letters'' and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art '', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

William McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style. After the First World War he moved to London with his wife, fellow student [[Agnes Miller Parker]] (1895–1980), where he joined the same circles as Fergusson, [[Vorticism|vorticist]] [[Wyndham Lewis]] (1882–1957) and nationalist composer [[Francis George Scott]]. Under these influences his work became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; William Johnstone (1897–1981) was a cousin of F. G. Scott and met MacDiarmid as a student at Edinburgh. He studied [[cubism]], [[surrealism]] and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period".&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, [http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/review-painters-in-parallel-william-johnstone-william-gillies-1-2063707 "Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone &amp; William Gillies"], ''Scotsman.com'', 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MacDairmidMemorialCropped.png|thumb|The MacDiarmid Memorial by Jake Harvey (1982–84)]]
Other artists influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]. They focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Scottish Group===
{{Main|New Scottish Group}}
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th century, 1890–2001'' (Mainstream, 2001), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (b. 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), who was resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name="Macmillan1990pp370-1"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1851582517}}, pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941–43.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and [[Bet Low]] (1924–2007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and [[Bet Low]]'s ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name="Macmillan1990pp370-1"/&gt;

===Photography===
{{Main|Scottish photography}}
In the early twentieth century notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations for the work of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Paul Strand]] (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow made by [[Bert Hardy]] (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and [[Oscar Marzaroli]] (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Little Sparta - CLAUDI.jpg|thumb|The "CLAUDI" Bridge at [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s [[Little Sparta]]]]
Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (1912–2004) and [[Margaret Mellis]] (1914–2009).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (b. 1920-2014),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]], and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]]. His most ambitious work, the garden of [[Little Sparta]] opened in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=K.

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (b. 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, grouped under the description of "Scottish Realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists who came to prominence in the 1980s, sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups", were associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]].&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (b. 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (b. 1960) and Adrian Wisniewski (b. 1958). Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work had a comic book-like quality and put an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wisniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopted a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employed figures reminiscent of characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints ''The Saracen Heads'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn (b. 1955–2010), Robert Maclaurin (b. 1965) and Gwen Hardie (b. 1962).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p212&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
{{Main|Sculpture in Scotland}}
The sculpture of [[Eric Schilsky]] (1898–1974) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93) was in the existing tradition of modelling and carving.&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"/&gt; In contrast sculptor and artist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.&lt;ref name=Roseetal2012p25&gt;L.

He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;C.

===Photographic renaissance===
[[File:sandy smith object moved edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The first room of the installation ''The Object Moved by its Own Success'', by [[Sandy Smith]] and [[Alex Gross]] (2008)]]
In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (b. 1959), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (b. 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Art schools and colleges===
{{See also|List of art schools in Europe}}
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow School of Art]], designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]]]
Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century, many of which continue to exist in different forms today. [[Edinburgh College of Art]] developed from the Trustees Academy, founded in the city in 1760, and was established in its current form in 1907. After a long independent history, in 2011 it became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8523596/Edinburgh-College-of-Art-guide.html ''Edinburgh College of Art guide''], ''The Telegraph'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845. [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen was founded in 1885. [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]] was founded in Dundee in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold and D. P. Corbett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QEsrlW8kH68C&amp;pg=PT296&amp;dq=scotland+schools+of+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqdiUaO6IKbP0QWSqIDABg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwADgy ''A Companion to British Art: 1600 to the Present''] (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013), {{ISBN|1118313771}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also smaller private institutions such as the [[Leith School of Art]] founded in a former [[Lutheran]] church in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ramsden, ''Leith: Scotland's Independent Art School: Founders and Followers'' (Edinburgh: Stone Trough Books, 2009), {{ISBN|0954454227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Photography is represented by courses at the major colleges of art and universities.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

===Organisations===
[[Creative Scotland]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in Scotland. It superseded the [[Scottish Arts Council]], which was formed in 1994 following a restructuring of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], but had existed as an [[autonomous]] body since a [[royal charter]] of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;M. Garber, ''Patronizing the Arts'' (Princeton University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|1400830036}}, pp. 55–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.-B. M. Quinn, ''Public Policy and the Arts: a Comparative Study of Great Britain and Ireland'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1998), {{ISBN|1840141743}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some local authorities and private interests have supported to the arts, although this has been more limited since local government reorganisation in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chisholm, ''Structural Reform of British Local Government: Rhetoric and Reality'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|071905771X}}, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Independent arts foundations that promote the visual arts include the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], founded in 1826 and granted a Royal Charter in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Concise Almanack 2012'' (A&amp;amp;C Black, 2011), {{ISBN|1408142309}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Photography is promoted by the Scottish Society for the History of Photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;{{clear}}

[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W.

Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

A '''brand''' is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] [http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B Dictionary]. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Marketing|publisher=fahy&amp; jobber|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands are used in [[business]], [[marketing]], and [[advertising]]. '''Name brands''' are sometimes distinguished from generic or [[store brand]]s.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in [[livestock branding]] as early as 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, H., ''The Miracle Of Man,'' London, Longacre, 1946, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot [[branding iron]]. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. However, the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics and fish sauce.

'''Branding''' is a set of [[marketing]] and communication methods that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand’s identity, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 |title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=17 |pages=4 |year=2008 |last1=Ghodeswar |first1=Bhimrao M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ranchhod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and [[brand valuation]] is an important management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

The word ‘brand’ is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''commodity brand'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].

==Etymology==
The word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|publication-date=1983|publication-place=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with branding irons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandingirons.com/index.html |title=The Evolution of Branding | publisher=Branding Irons Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/slave2.html The branding of slaves.] ''The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities''&lt;/ref&gt;  The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current meaning.

==History==
[[File:Amphorae for wine and oil, Archaeological Museum, Dion (6934667366).jpg|thumb |In pre-literate society, the distinctive shape of amphorae provided potential consumers with information about goods and quality. Pictured: Amphorae for wine and oil, [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum, Dion]].]] 
Branding and labelling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of [[Livestock branding|branding livestock]] in order to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Khan |first1= Saif Ullah |last2= Mufti |first2= Owais |title= The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands |journal= Journal of Managerial Sciences |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |year= 2007 |pages= 75–87 |url= http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, purchasers realised that the brand provided information about origin as well as about ownership, and could serve as a guide to quality. Branding was adapted by farmers, potters and traders for use on other types of goods such as pottery and ceramics. Forms of branding or proto-branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa, Asia and Europe at different times, depending on local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals, which acted as quasi-brands, have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE); large numbers of seals survive from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the Indus Valley (3,300–1,300 BCE) where the local community depended heavily on trade; cylinder seals came into use in [[Ur]] in Mesopotamia in around 3,000 BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property; and the use of maker's marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The origin and historical development of branding and advertising in the old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity marks, such as stamps on ceramics, were also used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Starcevic, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe," ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No, 3, 2015, pp 29-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |page= 107 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1,500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer, which were understood to convey information about product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |pages= 98 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the [[urban revolution]] in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality-control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, gave way to clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/523676 |title= Prehistories of Commodity Branding |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 49 |pages= 7 |year= 2008 |last1= Wengrow |first1= David }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels, with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed ''proto-brands''&lt;ref name=MooreReid2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/00076790802106299 |title= The birth of brand: 4000 years of branding |journal= Business History |volume= 50 |issue= 4 |pages= 419 |year= 2008 |last1= Moore |first1= Karl |last2= Reid |first2= Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other historians argue that the presence of these simple markings does not imply that mature [[brand management]] practices operated.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

The inscription, which reads "G(ari) F(los) SCO(mbri) SCAURI EX OFFI(CI)NA SCAURI", has been translated as: "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus"]]

One merchant who made good use of the [[titulus pictus]] was Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 CE. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house feature images of [[amphora]]e bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic depicts four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.2307/504744 |jstor= 504744 |title= A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii |journal= American Journal of Archaeology |volume= 88 |issue= 4 |pages= 557 |year= 1984 |last1= Curtis |first1= Robert I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 4. LIQUAMEN/ OPTIMUM/ EX OFFICI[n]/A SCAURI (translated as: "The best liquamen, from the shop of Scaurus")
Scauras' fish sauce was known by people across the Mediterranean to be of very high quality, and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In both Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use across a broad range of goods. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius"; probably references to the name of the producer.

The use of identity marks on products declined following the fall of the Roman Empire. However, in the European Middle Ages, [[heraldry]] developed a language of visual symbolism which would feed into the evolution of branding,&lt;ref&gt;

and with the rise of the [[merchant]]'s [[guild]]s the use of marks resurfaced and was applied to specific types of goods. By the 13th century the use of maker's marks had become evident on a broad range of goods. In 1266 makers' marks on bread became compulsory in England.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,'' Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians used brands in the form of [[watermark]]s on paper in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Colapinto|first= John|title= Famous Names |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto |accessdate= 9 October 2011|newspaper= The New Yorker|date= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blind stamp]]s, [[hallmark]]s, and silver-makers' marks - all types of brand - became widely used across Europe during this period.

Guinness World Records.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A characteristic feature of 19th-century mass-marketing was the widespread use of branding, originating with the advent of packaged [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007/&gt; [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] moved the production of many household items, such as [[soap]], from local communities to centralized [[factory|factories]]. When shipping their items, the factories would literally [[wood branding|brand]] their [[logo]] or company insignia on the barrels used, effectively using a corporate trademark as a quasi-brand.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930," ''CGR Working Paper,'' Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Factories established following the [[Industrial Revolution]] introduced mass-produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market - that is, to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods. &lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2; scholars describe this period as the era of "mass marketing"&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realise that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands. &lt;ref&gt;Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., "Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868-882&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the "cool" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.

The process of giving a brand "human" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''Quaker man'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 104; Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,''  Clarendon Press, 1996, pp 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pears (soap)|Pears' soap]], [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Juicy Fruit| Juicy Fruit chewing gum]] and [[Aunt Jemima]] pancake mix were also among the first products to be "branded" in an effort to increase the consumer's familiarity with the product's merits. Other brands which date from that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal, furnish illustrations of the trend.

[[File:Quaker Oats (3092914571).jpg|thumb|right|The Quaker Company was one of the earliest to use a character on its packaging, branding and advertising. Pictured: The Quaker Man, c. 1900]]

By the early 1900s, [[trade press|trade-press]] publications, [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and advertising [[expert]]s began producing books and pamphlets exhorting manufacturers to bypass retailers and to advertise direct to consumers with strongly branded messages. Around 1900, advertising guru [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house advertisement explaining [[trademark]] advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what scholars now recognize as modern branding and the beginnings of brand management.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 106-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued to the 1980s, and {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} is quantified in concepts such as [[value (ethics)|brand value]] and [[brand equity]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Naomi Klein]] has described this development as "brand equity mania".&lt;ref name="nologo" /&gt; In 1988, for example, [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] purchased [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] for six times what the company was worth on paper. Business analysts reported that what they really purchased was the brand name.

With the rise of [[mass media]] in the early 20th century, companies soon adopted techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and in early [[television]] broadcasting in the 1930s. Soap manufacturers sponsored many of the earliest [[radio drama|radio-drama]] series, and the genre became known as ''[[soap opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers had started to develop relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date= December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use [[motivational research]] and [[consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn from research into psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing", in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt; Brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality, based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own.&lt;ref&gt;

==Concepts==

Effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product, but of other products associated with that brand.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand, he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company - such as chocolate-chip cookies, for example. Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce.

===Brand names and trademarks===
{{See|Trademark|Trademark symbol}}
[[File:CocaColaBottle.jpg|thumb|''Coca-Cola'' is a brand name, while the distinctive Spencerian script and the contour bottle are trademarked]]
A brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and ''identifies'' a product, service or company  and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category. A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a "memory heuristic"; a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.

===Corporate brand identity===
Simply, the brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler,|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''. However, that expansion of the meaning of brand identity causes some confusion because it overlaps with other common branding terms, such as brand image, brand personality, and brand meaning. [...] ''Brand identity'' and ''brand image'' are only two of the buzz words that are used and confused by brand experts and brand managers.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity, it must have an in-depth understanding of its target market, competitors and the surrounding business environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The core identity reflects consistent long-term associations with the brand; whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Kotler et al. (2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:

# attributes
# benefits
# values
# personality

A brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a "just do it" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213 |title=INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=69 |year=2005 |last1=Madhavaram |first1=Sreedhar |last2=Badrinarayanan |first2=Vishag |last3=McDonald |first3=Robert E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Brand personality===

'''Brand personality''' refers to “the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands.” &lt;ref&gt;Azoulay, A and  Kapferer, J.N., "Do Brand Personality Scales Really Measure Brand Personality?" ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 11, No. 2, 2003 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human-like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610421011033467 |title=Impact of brand personality on three major relational consequences (trust, attachment, and commitment to the brand) |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=114 |year=2010 |last1=Louis |first1=Didier |last2=Lombart |first2=Cindy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique, brands that are differentiated from rival brands. Aaker conceptualised brand personality as consisting of five broad dimensions, namely: sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up to date), competence (reliable, intelligent, and successful), sophistication (glamorous, upper class, charming), and ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151897 |jstor=3151897 |title=Dimensions of Brand Personality |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=1997 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research studies have suggested that Aaker's dimensions of brand personality are relatively stable across different industries, market segments and over time. Much of the literature on branding suggests that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151914 |jstor=3151914 |title=The Malleable Self: The Role of Self-Expression in Persuasion |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=36 |pages=45 |year=1999 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.031 |title=Moderators of the self-congruity effect on consumer decision-making: A meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1179 |year=2012 |last1=Aguirre-Rodriguez |first1=Alexandra |last2=Bosnjak |first2=Michael |last3=Sirgy |first3=M. Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may distinguish the psychological aspect (brand associations like thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and so on that become linked to the brand) of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is termed the consumer's ''[[brand experience]]''. The brand is often intended to create an emotional response and recognition, leading to potential loyalty and repeat purchases. The brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the ''brand image'', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product, with a service, or with the companies providing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Marketers or product managers responsible for branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising theme]], as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[market (place)|marketplace]].{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. Orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called [[brand orientation]]. Brand orientation develops in response to [[market intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant and meaningful to a [[target audience]]. Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.

===Brand awareness===

{{Main|Brand awareness}}
[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos and branded advertising. Brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers &amp; potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.

Brand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing. That is, customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Donald (2010). "Success Factors In Establishing Your Brand" Franchising and Licensing Association. Retrieved from http://www.flasingapore.org/info_branding.php&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand's identity and of its communication methods.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title= integrated marketing communications|last= Chitty|first= Williams|publisher= Thomson|year= 2005|isbn= 0 17 012008 2|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness, as this can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/mar.4220090402|title= A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal= Psychology and Marketing|volume= 9|issue= 4|pages= 263|year= 1992|last1= Percy|first1= Larry|last2= Rossiter|first2= John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of brand awareness can be identified. Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.

* Most companies aim for "'''Top-of-Mind'''" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, "Kleenex", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.
* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category
* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.
* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.

===Brand recognition===

'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product: |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.

Brand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's "signature" logo), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].

=== Brand recall===

Unlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for [[Value proposition|value creation]] will often involve applying marketing-mix modeling techniques in conjunction with [[brand valuation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Brand communication===

{{See|Advertising management|Integrated marketing communications|Marketing communications|Promotion (marketing)}}
Although brand identity is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the most fundamental asset to a brand's [[brand equity|equity]], the worth of a brand's identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi A, Lorestani HZ, Mazidi AK. Investigating the effects of brand identity on customer loyalty from social identity perspective. Iranian Journal of Management Studies. 2013;6(2):153-78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated marketing communications]] (IMC) relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its [[stakeholder (disambiguation)|stakeholder]]s .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Five key components comprise IMC:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# advertising
# sales promotions
# direct marketing
# personal selling
# public relations

The effectiveness of a brand's communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand's intended message through its IMC. Although IMC is a broad strategic concept, the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Firstly, a source/sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver. This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* After the encoding stage, the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Advertising and promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last= Belch|first= G .E|publisher= McGrawHill Irwin|year= 2012|isbn= |location= New York, NY United States of America|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In IMC, channels may include media elements such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, etc.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded, which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Finally, the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render. Often, a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market, which is caused by "…unplanned static or distortion during the communication process".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message, which is received by the original sender as feedback.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver, it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message. Therefore, a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively "…affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived" &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dahlen M, Lange F, Smith T. Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers, marketers must "…consider all [[touchpoint|touch point]]s, or sources of contact, that a customer has with the brand".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Shimp TA. Integrated marketing communications in advertising and promotion. 8 ed. Mason, OH United States of America: South Western, Cengage Learning; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model, where a message travels from the sender to the receiver. Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate - defines a touch point. According to Dalen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the "…potential to add positive - or suppress negative - associations to the brand's equity" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel, is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 |title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=592 |year=2014 |last1=Uzunoğlu |first1=Ebru |last2=Misci Kip |first2=Sema }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM). EWoM is a relatively new{{when|date=August 2016}} approach identified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to communicate with consumers. One popular method of eWOM involves [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] (SNSs) such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E., Sung, Y. and Kang, H., 2014. Brand followers' retweeting behavior on Twitter: How brand relationships influence brand electronic word-of-mouth. Computers in Human Behavior, 37, pp.18–25&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site (Twitter). Research further found that the more consumers "retweeted" and communicated with a brand, the more they trusted the brand. This suggests that a company could look to employ a [[social-media marketing|social-media campaign]] to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages.

McKee (2014) also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand, a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognizing the brand.&lt;ref&gt;.McKee, S., 2014. Branding Made Simple. [online] Bloomberg Business. Available at: &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/branding-made-simple&gt; [Accessed 6 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims, that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers, and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2011.11.001 |title=Why consumers do (not) like global brands: The role of globalization attitude, GCO and global brand origin |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=29 |pages=25 |year=2012 |last1=Riefler |first1=Petra }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service's brand name, as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/296297 |title=To Brand or Not to Brand? A Theoretical and Empirical Question |journal=The Journal of Business |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=279 |year=1985 |last1=Sappington |first1=David E. M |last2=Wernerfelt |first2=Birger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market, the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., 2009. Idea Branding. [online] ''The Economist''. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/14126533&gt; [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found{{by whom|date=August 2016}} that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi-sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.09.005 |title=The consumer psychology of brands |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=22 |pages=7 |year=2012 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Bernd }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article suggests that other senses, apart from vision, need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;
Anon., 2007. Sensory branding Sound effects. [online] The Economist. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/9079881&gt; [Accessed 5 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition, purchasing behaviour and brand recall.

Therefore, when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers, companies should investigate a channel of communication which is most suitable for their short-term and long-term aims and should choose a method of communication which is most likely to be adhered to{{clarify|date=August 2016}} by their chosen consumers.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"/&gt; The match-up between the product, the [[consumer lifestyle]], and the endorser is important for effectiveness of brand communication.

==Global brand variables==

===Brand name===
[[File:Relationships trade marks – brand.svg|thumb|Relationship between trade marks and brand]]
The term "brand name" is quite often used interchangeably with "brand", although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product. In this context a "brand name" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through trademark registration - such trademarks are called "Registered Trademarks"{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].

====Types of brand names====
Brand names come in many styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few include:
* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as "UPS" or "IBM"
* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as "Whole Foods" or "Toys R' Us"
* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as "Reese's Pieces" or "[[Dunkin' Donuts]]"
* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as "Amazon" or "Crest"
* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as "Wii" or "[[Häagen-Dazs]]"
* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as "Volvo" or "Samsung"
* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as "[[Hewlett-Packard]]", "Dell", "Disney", "Stussy" or "Mars"
* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as "[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]" or "[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]"
* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|"Nike"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as "[[Betty Crocker]]"
* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as "[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]", "Wok on Water" or "Eggs Eggscetera"
* '''combination''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as "[[Microsoft]]" ("microcomputer" and "software"), "[[Comcast]]" ("communications" and "broadcast"), "[[Evernote]]" ("forever" and "note"), "[[Vodafone]]" ("voice", "data", "telephone")

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]—which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word "copy".

===Brand line===
A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].


[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.

===Brand identity===
{{Main|Corporate identity}}
The outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is brand identity.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand"&gt;Neumeier, Marty (2004), ''The Dictionary of Brand''. {{ISBN|1-884081-06-1}}, pp.20&lt;/ref&gt; Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand" /&gt; The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.

Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.

====Visual brand identity====
[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]

A brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement – simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of "Less is more") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [Lippincott and Margulies], [[Paul Rand]], and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.

Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/col.20594 |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=36 |pages=55 |year=2011 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Zena }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand trust===
Brand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Brand management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33–58 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.

''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is a syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of action, behavior, communication and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. Action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.

===Brand parity===
Brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=28 |year=1994 |last1=Richardson |first1=Paul S |last2=Dick |first2=Alan S |last3=Jain |first3=Arun K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.

==Expanding role of brands==
The original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.

Today, brands play a much bigger role. Brands have been co-opted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as powerful symbols in larger debates about economics, social issues, and politics. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bianca |url= http://merriamassociates.com/2010/12/wikileaks-hacktivism-and-brands-as-political-symbols/ |title= Wikileaks, Hacktivism and Brands as Political Symbols « Merriam Associates, Inc.

===Company name===
Often, especially in the industrial sector, it is just the company's name which is promoted (leading to{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} one of the most powerful statements of branding: saying just before the company's downgrading. This approach has not worked as well for [[General Motors]], which recently overhauled how its corporate brand relates to the product brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company « Merriam Associates, Inc.

Decisions about company names and [[Product naming|product names]] and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nisha Roy (nisharoy) – Pearltrees |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |title=Brand Architecture: Strategic Considerations « Merriam Associates, Inc.

In this case, a strong brand name (or company name) is made the vehicle for a range of products (for example, [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[Black &amp; Decker]]) or a range of subsidiary brands (such as [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk, Cadbury Flake, or [[Cadbury Fingers]] in the UK).

Each brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]]), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).

===Challenger brands===
{{main|Challenger brand}}
A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader or a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset which sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.

===Multiproduct branding strategy===
Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  
Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church &amp; Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church &amp; Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.

====Product line extension====
{{main|Product line extension}}
Product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.

====Subbranding====
{{main|Subbranding}}
Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].

====Brand extension====
{{main|Brand extension}}
Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.

====Co-branding====
{{main|Co-branding}}
Co-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.

===Multibranding strategy===
Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestlé]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].

This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.

====Fighting brands====
{{main|Fighter brand}}
The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.

===Private branding strategy===

{{main|Store brand}}
Private branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.

In Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.

===Mixed branding strategy===
Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. 
For example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the "skin simple" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.

===Attitude branding and iconic brands===
Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 2000 book ''[[No Logo]]'',&lt;ref name="nologo"&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2000) ''[[No logo]]'', Canada: Random House, {{ISBN|0-676-97282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a "fetish strategy". Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' - brands that are able to gain and retain "meaning beyond the material."&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015. Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands. Kogan Page. p.17. {{ISBN|9780749470036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, S., Kuehlwein, J.P. and Schaefer, W., ''Asia Management Insights,'' Singapore Management University, Vol.3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. – [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:English &amp; Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]

Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be "identity brands". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them "iconic brands". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.

There are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):
# "Necessary conditions" – The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.
# "Myth-making" – A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.
# "Cultural contradictions" – Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.
# "The cultural brand management process" – Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.

Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015.

==="No-brand" branding===
Recently, a number of companies have successfully pursued "no-brand" strategies by creating packaging that imitates [[generic brand]] simplicity. Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means "No label" in English (from 無印良品 – "Mujirushi Ryohin" – literally, "No brand quality goods"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, a simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Heig, Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive, pg.216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130122022144/http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|deadurl=yes|title=The ‘no brand’ brand - EMEASEE|date=22 January 2013|archivedate=22 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"No brand" branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name.
"Tapa Amarilla" or "Yellow Cap" in Venezuela during the 1980s is another good example of no-brand strategy. It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.

{{See|Derived demand}}
In this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) "[[Intel Inside]]".

===Brand extension and brand dilution===

{{See|brand extension}}
The existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;
for example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.

Mars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.

There is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.
When [[Coca-Cola]] launched "Diet Coke" and "Cherry Coke", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.

The risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Social media brands===
In 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. "We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see." &lt;ref name="Media Democracy"&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Better-Mousetrap-Invention-Democracy/dp/0749466219], 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2013) Simon Pont. Kogan Page. {{ISBN|978-0749466213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-brands===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Alternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as multi-brand strategy.

Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what
business the company is in or diluting higher quality products.

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of "facings" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).

[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.

===Private labels===

{{See|Private label}}
[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this "own brand" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.

'''Designer Private Labels'''

A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.

In Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and ‘L’ for Lisa Ho.&lt;ref&gt;Schetzer, A., "Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers ‘Collette’ for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research,"Private Label Could be the New Black" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337&lt;/ref&gt; Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her “Petites’ range.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion," Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520&lt;/ref&gt; Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frames designed by Peter Morrissey.

===Individual and organizational brands===
With the development of brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is leave social impact so their brand become associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims. Organizational brands have well determined brand guidelines and logo variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|title=AIESEC BLUE BOOK Brand Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625183605/http://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowd sourced branding===
These are brands that are created by "the public" for the business, which is opposite to the traditional method where the business create a brand.

===Personalised branding===

Many businesses have started to use elements of personalisation in their branding strategies, offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand. Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people. [[AirBNB]] has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand's mark known as The Bélo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |title=Airbnb says its new logo belongs to everyone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921204457/http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |archivedate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation branding (place branding and public diplomacy)===
{{See|Place branding}}
[[Nation branding]] is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure, build and manage the reputation of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state "and the successful transference of this image to its exports – is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."

===Destination branding===

Destination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote to themselves. This work is designed to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.

==Doppelgänger brand image (DBI)==
{{Main|Doppelgänger brand image}}
A doppelgänger brand image or "DBI"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''gänger'' (walker).

Doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.

Due to the ability of Doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.

Examples include:
* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emancipation Statue''' is a public [[sculpture]] symbolising the "breaking of the chains" of slavery at Emancipation. It is located in [[Barbados]], east of [[Bridgetown]] at centre of the J.T.C. Ramsay roundabout formed at the junction of the [[ABC Highway]] and Highway 5.  Many Barbadians refer to the statue as [[Bussa]], the name of a slave who helped inspire a revolt against slavery in Barbados in 1816, though the statue is not actually sculpted to be Bussa.

The statue, made of bronze, was created in 1985 by [[Barbadian people|Bajan]] sculptor [[Karl Broodhagen]] 169 years after the rebellion.

'''''Champlevé''''' is an [[enamelling]] technique in the [[decorative arts]], or an object made by that process, in which troughs or cells are carved, etched, die struck, or [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] into the surface of a metal object, and filled with [[vitreous enamel]]. The piece is then fired until the enamel fuses, and when cooled the surface of the object is polished. The uncarved portions of the original surface remain visible as a frame for the enamel designs; typically they are [[gilded]] in medieval work.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332&lt;/ref&gt;  The name comes from the French for "raised field", "field" meaning background, though the technique in practice lowers the area to be enamelled rather than raising the rest of the surface. 

The technique has been used since ancient times, though it is no longer among the most commonly used enamelling techniques. Champlevé is suited to the covering of relatively large areas, and to figurative images, although it was first prominently used in [[Celtic art]] for geometric designs.  In [[Romanesque art]] its potential was fully used, decorating caskets, plaques and vessels, in [[Limoges enamel]] and that from other centres. 
  
Champlevé is distinguished from the technique of [[cloisonné]] enamel in which the troughs are created by soldering flat metal strips to the surface of the object. The difference between the techniques is analogous to the [[woodworking]] techniques of [[intarsia]] and [[marquetry]].  It differs from the ''[[basse-taille]]'' technique, which succeeded it in the highest quality Gothic work, in that the bottoms of the recesses for the enamel are rough, and so only opaque enamel colours are used. In ''basse-taille'' the recesses are modelled, and translucent enamels are used, for more subtle effects, as in the 14th century Parisian [[Royal Gold Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early champlevé==
[[File:Ornamental Bronze Plaque, Celtic Horse-gear, Santon, Norfolk.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic red enamel on horse-harness, Britain, c. AD 50]] 
 
Enamel was first used on small pieces of jewellery, and has often disintegrated in ancient pieces that have been buried.  Consistent and frequent use of champlevé technique is first seen in the [[La Tène style]] of early [[Celtic art]] in Europe, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC, where the predominant colour was a red, possibly intended as an imitation of red [[coral]] (as used on the [[Witham Shield]]), and the base was usually [[bronze]].  The "Insular Celts" of the British Isles made especially common use of the technique, seen as highlights on the relief decoration of the [[Battersea Shield]] and other pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 8-10, Osbourne, 332&lt;/ref&gt; However this was technically not true enamel in the usual sense of the word, as the glass was only heated until it became a soft paste before being pushed into place. This is sometimes informally known as "sealing-wax" enamelling, and may be described as "glass inlay" or similar terms.  True enamelling technique, where glass paste is put into place and fired until it liquifies, was learnt from the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 173&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest literary description of enamel is from the Greek [[sophist]] [[Philostratus III]], who wrote in his ''Icones'' (Bk I, 28), describing polychrome horse-harness: "It is said that the barbarians in the Ocean pour these colours on heated bronze and that they adhere, become as hard as stone and preserve the designs that are made on them".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Staffordshire Moorlands Pan (1284837406).jpg|thumb|The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]], 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel in four colours.]]

Celtic curvilinear styles were highly effective in enamel, and were used throughout the Roman period when they largely disappear in other media. The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] is a 2nd-century ''trulla'' with large enamel roundels in four colours of enamel, commissioned by or for Draco, a soldier, possibly a Greek, as a souvenir of his service on [[Hadrian's Wall]].  It is one of a group of similar enamelled vessels found in Britain and northern Gaul.  Smaller items from similar contexts include [[brooch]]es and other jewellery, and mounts for horse harness as described by Philostratus.  Around the end of the Roman Empire new forms arose: the terminals of the increasingly fancy [[penannular brooches]] of the British Isles become decorated with champlevé, as do other fasteners and fittings, and the mounts of [[hanging bowl]]s.  These last have long puzzled art historians, as not only is their purpose unclear, but they are mostly found in [[Anglo-Saxon]] and Viking contexts, including three at [[Sutton Hoo]], but their decoration uses predominantly Celtic motifs. One of the Sutton Hoo bowls had been repaired, but in a different, Germanic, style.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford, 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, production of the different types of hanging bowls covers the period 400–1100.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford, 34, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  While the leading expert, [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]], sees the bowls as the products of "Celtic" workshops, perhaps often in Ireland, in the same period the use of large areas of champlevé in the most ornate [[Celtic brooches]] reduces, though gem-like enamel highlights, some in ''[[millefiori]]'', are still found.  In [[Anglo-Saxon art]], as in that of most of Europe and the Byzantine world, this was the period when cloisonné technique dominated enamelling.

==Romanesque==
[[File:Limoges enamel ciborium pseudo Kufic circa 1200.jpg|thumb|left|Elaborate Limoges [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], c. 1200]] 
Champlevé is especially associated with [[Romanesque art]], and many of the finest survivals of the style feature the technique. There was a great increase in use of the technique in several areas in the late 11th century, just as the Romanesque style matured.  The immediate source of the style remains obscure; various exotic origins have been suggested, but the great expansion in the use of [[stained glass]] at the same period is probably connected.  Copper or bronze bases were normally used, which were soft and easy to work, as well as relatively cheap, but as they discoloured in heat opaque enamels needed to be used.  Blue was now the dominant colour, as in stained glass; the best blues in painting (whether on wall, panel or manuscript) were very expensive whereas in glass rich blues are easily obtainable.   

[[Mosan art|Mosan]] and [[Limoges enamels]] are the most famous, and the figures carved in the copper plate display a superb sense of line.  The [[Stavelot Triptych]] in New York is an example of the finest Mosan work, and the [[Becket Casket]] in London a fine early piece from Limoges.  The names of several Mosan [[goldsmith]]-enamellers are known.  Relief and fully modelled figures were also enamelled, and some metal bases formed by hammering into moulds.  The Limoges production increased steadily in quantity, and by the Gothic period had declined in quality, but provided a fairly cheap product, especially of [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]] caskets,   produced on a semi-industrial scale and exported all over Europe.  Spanish enamels, not easily distinguished from Limoges work, were also produced on a large scale.  Mosan work was sometimes on gold or [[silver-gilt]], but in Limoges and Spain [[gilding|gilt-copper]] is usual, and much Mosan work uses this too, as in the example illustrated.  This example also shows the mixing of different colours and shades within the same cell, here used throughout the design in a complex manner, whereas in the Limoges examples below much less, and much simpler, use is made of this difficult technique.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
A similar technique was known as "shippou-zogan" in [[Japan]], where it was considered a form of [[damascening]].

The '''Chicago film industry''' is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before [[Hollywood]] became the undisputed capital of film making.  In the early 1900s, [[Chicago]] boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  [[Essanay Studios]] founded by [[George K. Spoor]] was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.  Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] gave birth to the western genre.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the [[Great Depression]]. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making.  Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as ''[[Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.

==Beginnings of the Chicago film industry==

===Essanay Studios===
[[File:Essanay.jpg|thumb|Essanay Studio]]
[[File:His new job.jpg|thumb|''His New Job'' featuring Charlie Chaplin at Essanay Studios, Chicago'']]

Essanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]].  Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.&lt;ref name = "Scheetz"&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/scheetz Scheetz, George] (1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Chicago_Film_Industry.html?id=r8fWXwAACAAJ The Chicago Film Industry: Beginnings to 1918]''. Dissertation, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign English Department. Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation.  Spoor was intrigued by Edison's [[Kinetoscope]] at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved.  Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago.  The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company.  Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement.  He acted in the production of ''The Great Train Robbery'',and became one of the first western stars.  His nickname became, "Broncho Billy", for his involvement with western films.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California.  These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

Essanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios.  He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week.&lt;ref name ="Verdi"&gt;Verdi, Tony (1996).  When Chicago was Hollywood. Hollywood's Attic. Burbank, California.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor.  Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects.  Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called ''[[His New Job]]''.&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt;  Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was [[Gloria Swanson]].  Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].

Despite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn.  Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions.  After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west.  Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, [[Max Linder]], to take the role of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences.  The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film.  In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as [[Vitagraph Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]] which would eventually absorbed by [[Warner Brothers]].&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding.  Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of [[St. Augustine College (Illinois)|St. Augustine's College]] which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.&lt;ref name="Christopher"&gt;Christopher, Rob.

===Motion Picture Patents Company===

The rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] and William Dickson patented the [[Kinetoscope]]. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the [[Biograph Company]], and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing.

Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"&gt;Lindstrom, J.A. [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/452.html''Film'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Chicago, 2004. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;   This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios.&lt;ref name="Dirks"&gt;Dirks, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/pre20sintro3.html "Film History Before 1920"], [[AMC Filmsite]], Chicago. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

===The Chicago independents push back===
Exhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors.&lt;ref&gt;"Declare War on Film Trust.: Five Cent Theater Men Organize for Resistance. Chicago Daily Tribune, 16 Jan 1909: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago-based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the [[Western Vaudeville Managers' Association]], dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the Feb. 6, 1909, issue of ''Show World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Moving Picture War is Declared: Independents Organized by J. J. Murdock for Fight on "Film Trust." Chicago Daily Tribune 05 Feb 1909: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights.

==Boom of the Chicago film industry==

===1900s===

[[File:BBA Lantern Slide.jpg|thumb|An Advertisement for a western produced by Essanay founder, Brocho Billy Anderson]]

Chicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations.

Revolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon &amp; Film Exchange, William Swanson &amp; Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them.&lt;ref name="Dirks"/&gt;  This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Movie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the [[Selig Polyscope Company]], dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the [[Chicago River]] were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;

==Decline of the Chicago film industry==

===1920s===
The Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

In addition to the avoidance of legal trouble, [[California]] was perfect for film making in other respects as well. Weather was notably milder compared to the unpredictability of Chicago's climate. This enabled production to move at a steady pace with greater consistency.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  The scenery of the west also attracted many production companies. California is made up of a diverse landscape of natural settings while Chicago offered a monotone set of plains. Filmmakers followed in the footsteps of G.M. Anderson with the desire to film westerns within the natural mountainous habitat.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

==Revival==

===1920s to present===
Despite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919–1952).&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. [[Balaban and Katz]] owned movie and stage palaces such as the [[Chicago Theatre]], [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre]], and [[Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; High-profile film companies such as [[MGM]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Republic]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] all held offices in Chicago.

Movie production again entered Chicago in the 1980 with the state of [[Illinois]] becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]], [[The Color of Money]], [[Risky Business]], [[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]], [[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', and ''[[When Harry Met Sally]].'' Feature film directors returned to the city including [[Dan Aykroyd]] and the [[Belushi family]] (''[[Blues Brothers]], [[About Last Night...|About Last Night]]'', and ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''), [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] (''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''), and [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] (''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'').&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Chicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, Dan. [http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=170338''Illinois Tax Credit put Chicago Film Industry Back on the Map'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Medill Reports Chicago]]'', Chicago, 13 October 2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', and ''[[Source Code]]''. The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

[[Image:Inferno Canto 6 lines 49-52.jpg|thumb|Dante meets Ciacco. Engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]   
'''''Ciacco''''' {{IPA-it|ˈtʃakko|}} is one of the characters in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] that were not yet well defined by historians. This is how he presents himself to Dante when he is in [[Inferno (Dante)|Hell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
«Voi cittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco;
per la dannosa colpa de la gola,
come tu vedi, a la pioggia mi fiacco.»

«Ye citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony,
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.»

''(Inferno, VI, 52-54)''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This way introducing himself allows us to interpret it in various ways, but one of the oldest commentators of the Comedy suggests a derogatory nature of this name: "Ciacco is said to be a pig's name, hence he was called this way for his gluttony."

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] makes of Ciacco eighth story of the ninth day of the ''[[Decameron]]'', describing him as "the most gluttonous fellow that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reference to Ciacco's name is somewhat ambiguous: he is referred to as the man "whom everyone called Ciacco."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to say if Boccaccio had sources for his writings aside from Dante, because this name has not been found in literature before Dante. According to Vittorio Sermonti, a scholar dedicated to the study of the Comedy, the hypothesis that this Ciacco is the poet Ciacco dell'Anguillara is not true{{fact|date=August 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7438">'''Circles''' was a feminist film and video distribution network in the UK, which was set up out of a desire to distribute and screen [[women's cinema|women's films]] on their own terms. It was founded in 1979 by feminist filmmakers [[Lis Rhodes]], Jo Davis, Felicity Sparrow and [[Annabel Nicolson]], publishing a 1980 catalogue including about 30 films, and it closed in 1991, largely due to funding issues that also prompted the merger of Circles and Cinema of Women, which led to the formation of [[Cinenova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattar|first1=Mira|title=Out of the Past: An Interview with Cinenova|journal=Mute [online]|date=2011-06-28|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/out-past-interview-cinenova|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous funding crisis in 1987, when funding by Tower Hamlets council had been withdrawn, had been resolved with replacement funding from the [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="Distribution Matters: Circles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merz|first1=Caroline|last2=Parmar|first2=Pratibha|title=Distribution Matters: Circles|journal=Screen|date=1 December 1987|volume=28|issue=4|page=67|doi=10.1093/screen/28.4.66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to Jenny Holland and Jane Harris, "Circles started in 1979, partly as a response to an [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] exhibition on [[experimental film]]. Feeling that their work on women's involvement in this field was being marginalised, the women on the exhibition committee withdrew their painstakingly researched work and issued an explanatory statement. In many ways, this research was the cornerstone of Circles, which went on to distribute the films by [[Alice Guy]], [[Germaine Dulac]], [[Maya Deren]], and [[Lois Weber]] which were to have been discussed in the exhibition."&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite book|title=The women's Companion to international film|isbn=0-520-08879-4|editor-last =Kuhn 
 | editor-first =Annette 
 | editor2-last =Radstone
 | editor2-first =Susannah | first = Jenny
 | last = Holland
 |first2 = Jane
|last2= Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, "Women and the Formal Film," was published in the "Film as Film" exhibition catalogue and acted as a manifesto for the distribution collective that emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first3=Jane|author1=Annabel Nicolson|author2=Felicity Sparrow|author3=Jane Clarke|author4=Jeanette Iljon|author5=Lis Rhodes|author6=Mary Pat Leece|author7=Pat Murphy|author8=Susan Stein|authorlink1=Women and the Formal Film|editor1-last=Drummond|editor1-first=Phil|title=Film as Film|date=1979|publisher=Arts Council of Great Britain|location=London|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Catalogue==
By the time of its closure, Circles' catalogue comprised over 200 titles, predominantly short and medium-length films, encompasses 90 years of women's film production and including a range of original formats, "offering tape recording, video tapes, slide/tape and performance works for hire alongside film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxonline.org.uk/histories/1970-1979/circles.html|title=''Circles'' formed to distribute women artists' film and video. |date=1979 |website=www.luxonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue editors described the films and their significance as: &lt;blockquote&gt;representing the visions, truths and ideas of women from a diverse range of cultural and political backgrounds. Each film/video breaks the monopoly of the male-defined culture, placing women at the centre of the images, the stories and the language; replacing male subjectivity with women's experiences as female eyes look through the camera.… These films and videos represent the voices of women who have been systematically silenced and abused, by a mainstream media and cinema, whose interest in ideas and people are based on commercial concerns of profit and the desire to maintain women as spectators. Women in refusing to be confined to this role have produced films and videos, often with low budgets or none at all; often under difficult personal circumstances, yet independently without the pressure to either compromise politically or aesthetically. Despite narrow ideas of content, form and 'entertainment', which have excluded and dismissed this body of work, women are producing films and videos on a larger scale than ever before and the demand for this material is increasing.&lt;ref name=catalogue&gt;{{cite book|title=CiRCleS: Womens Film + Video Distribution Catalogue|date=1987|publisher=Russel Press|editor-last =Holland | editor-first =Jenny | editor2-last =Harris | editor2-first =Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Circles was a membership organisation. "All women whose films Circles distribute automatically become members, which means they have the right to become involved in creating policy."&lt;ref name="Distribution Matters: Circles"/&gt; The selection of titles was carried out by a regular Viewing Committee, composed of an open panel with wide representation from women's groups involved in production and exhibition. [[Pratibha Parmar]] notes that, in 1987, this led to the foregrounding of films by women of colour, quoting Circles member June Givanni on the creation of the short films programme 'Black Women and Invisibility': "invisibility here is about the lack of recognition by the wider community, and to some extent the black community that there are black women film-makers working in Britain. The range of films and videos made by black women available in this country is growing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merz|first1=Caroline|last2=Parmar|first2=Pratibha|title=Distribution Matters: Circles|journal=Screen|date=1 December 1987|volume=28|issue=4|page=68|doi=10.1093/screen/28.4.66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
According to the catalogue, Circles organised women-only screenings at the Four Corners 50 seater cinema in [[Bethnal Green]], London, and also in association with other women's organisations across Britain. At these events, film/video producers were invited to talk about their work.&lt;ref name="catalogue"/&gt; Describing Circles' business model, Caroline Merz writes that "Circles [had a] commitment to returning the highest possible revenue to film-makers, many of whom are not waged for their work, and a refusal to undercut their rental prices by providing what would, in effect, be subsidised programming."&lt;ref name="Distribution Matters: Circles"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many Circles titles continue to circulate in the UK via [http://www.cinenova.org/browse.php Cinenova], and Circles' content and history were prominent in the 2011 Cinenova exhibition "Reproductive Labour" at London's The Showroom gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=George|title=Cinenova: Reproductive Labour|journal=Afterall [online]|date=June 8, 2011|url=http://www.afterall.org/online/cinenova}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Holland and Harris comment that: "Circles has had an impact far out of proportion to its small size and chronic financial insecurity." &lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt;

{{About||the American revolutionary war pamphlet by Thomas Paine|Common Sense (pamphlet)|other uses}}
{{Group intelligence}}
'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambattista Vico===
[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}. Also see {{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, p.&amp;nbsp;3, and Gadamer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Reid and the Scottish school===
[[File:ThomasReid.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Reid, founder of the Scottish school of Common Sense.]]
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">A '''copywriting agency''' is a business that provides writing and editing services to businesses and other organizations. Like individual copywriters, [[copywriting]] agencies may offer writing on a for-hire or per-project basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://job-descriptions.careerplanner.com/Copy-Writers.cfm|title=Job Duties and Tasks for: "Copy Writer"|publisher=CareerPlanner.com|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, because copywriting agencies often offer the services of many staff members, they may offer a broader range of services than can individuals. These services include but not limited to writing, editing, content or marketing consulting, [[brand]]ing, [[Product naming|naming]], [[scriptwriting]], [[speechwriting]], [[information architecture]], print and [[web design]] and layout, [[Software engineering|software development]], [[social network]]ing consulting and implementation, and [[project management]]. An agency may also partner with other businesses—for example, design or advertising firms—or with in-house client teams. Depending on the project, agency staff may work onsite with the client, from the agency offices, or virtually from any location.

Copywriting agencies may be designed on an employee model, with full- or part-time employees providing services to clients. Others may work with a regular team of trusted contractors, while still others function more like middlemen, connecting clients and editorial freelancers and taking a cut of the proceeds from each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careercenter.aaaa.org/jobs/5402501/copywriter|title=Copywriter|publisher=AAAA Career Center|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business and nonprofit clients often hire copywriting agencies for larger projects that fall outside of existing skills and time or staffing needs, or for projects that require expertise in a specific discipline or area of knowledge. Many agencies specialize in one or more industries—doing work for clients, for example, in publishing, finance, technology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, the environment, engineering, government, the military, education, the arts, or the nonprofit world. Others employ writers, editors, etc. with varying specialties, so as to work for a variety of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-15/how-to-hire-an-ad-agencybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=How to Hire an Ad Agency|last=McKee|first=Steve|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing for overall economic trends, job prospects for both individual copywriters and copywriting agencies expanded during the 1990s and 2000s, for reasons including an increased need for production and editing of online contentand an increase in business outsourcing and freelancing. As of 2012, employment for freelance writers is expected to continue to grow.

'''''Django Unchained''''' is a 2012 American [[revisionist Western]] film written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]], starring [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Kerry Washington]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], with [[Walton Goggins]], [[Dennis Christopher]], [[James Remar]], and [[Don Johnson]] in supporting roles.  Set in the [[American frontier|Old West]] and [[Antebellum era#Antebellum era (1781–1860)|Antebellum]] [[Southern United States|South]], it is a highly [[Stylization|stylized]] tribute to [[Spaghetti Western]]s, in particular the 1966 Italian film ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' by [[Sergio Corbucci]], whose star [[Franco Nero]] has a [[cameo appearance]].

Development of ''Django Unchained'' began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with [[Michael K. Williams]] and [[Will Smith]] being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming and Louisiana.

''Django Unchained'' premiered at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on December 11, 2012, and was released on December 25, 2012, in the United States. The film was nominated for several film industry awards, including five [[Academy Awards]]. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them Best Supporting Actor at the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globes]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTAs]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Awards]]. Tarantino won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|BAFTA]] award for writing the film's original screenplay. The film grossed over $425 million worldwide in theaters against its $100 million budget, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing theatrical release.

==Plot==
In 1858 [[Texas]], brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] on foot. Among them is [[Django (character)|Django]], sold off and separated from his wife {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}&lt;!--Not "Brunhilde." Broomhilda is the correct spelling of this character's name.--&gt; von Shaft, a [[house slave]]. The brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German [[dentist]]-turned-[[bounty hunter]] who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a trio of [[outlaw]]s for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant. When the suspicious Ace levels his gun at him, Schultz kills him with a [[fast draw]] and then kills Dicky's horse, which falls and crushes Dicky's leg. Schultz insists on paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving Dicky to the newly freed slaves, who kill him and follow the [[Polaris|North Star]] to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down.

They track the Brittles to the [[Tennessee]] plantation of Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett and kill them. Bennett musters a large gang to raid their camp in the night; Schultz ambushes them with an explosive, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Feeling morally obliged to Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}. Schultz trains Django as his apprentice, and the two become partners. Django soon collects his first bounty, keeping the [[wanted poster|handbill]]&lt;!--referred to as such multiple times in the movie.--&gt; for good luck.

In 1859, Django and Schultz travel to [[Mississippi]] where they learn the identity of {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s new owner: Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called "Mandingo fights". Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentleman's club in [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and offer $12,000 for one of his best fighters; however, their ulterior motive is to purchase {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to Candyland.

The group encounters Calvin's slave trackers en route: cornering one of Calvin's disfigured Mandingo fighters, D'Artagnan, who tried to escape to avoid fighting again. Angered, Calvin has several attack dogs devour D'Artagnan alive. After finding {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvin's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan. He alerts Calvin, who alters the deal at gunpoint so that {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} will be sold for $12,000 instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Calvin smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake; Schultz, sick of Calvin's cruelty, shoots him through the heart with his [[Sleeve gun|concealed]] [[derringer]], killing him. Schultz is killed by Calvin's bodyguard, who is then killed with his own [[revolver]] by Django. A shootout ensues, and Django kills many of Calvin's henchmen. When he runs out of ammunition, Stephen tells Django to surrender or Broomhilda will be killed; he surrenders.

The next morning, Stephen tells Django that Calvin's sister Lara has taken charge, and that he will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them his first handbill, tells them that the men on the handbill are back at Candyland, and promises them all but $500 of the reward money if they free him and help him kill the wanted men. The escorts release him and give him a revolver, which he immediately uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of [[dynamite]]. Django kills Calvin's slave trackers, takes {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, and frees his wife from a nearby cabin.

When Calvin's mourners return from his burial, Django kills Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] Stephen before igniting the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. Django and {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before riding off together.

===Development===
[[File:Quentin Tarantino Django 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tarantino in Paris at the film's French premiere, January 2013]]
In 2007, Tarantino discussed an idea for a type of [[Spaghetti Western]] set in the United States' pre-Civil War [[Deep South]]. He called this type of film "a Southern", stating that he wanted: {{cquote|to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like Spaghetti Westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hiscock |first=John |date=April 27, 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3664742/Quentin-Tarantino-Im-proud-of-my-flop.html |title=Quentin Tarantino: I'm proud of my flop |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: {{cquote|I was writing a book about [[Sergio Corbucci]] when I came up with a way to tell the story.&amp;nbsp;... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with [[fascism]]. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [this] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'{{thinsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/07/14/django-unchained-comic-con-panel-tarantino-talks-links-to-other-movies-don-johnson-talks-foghorn-leghorn/|title='Django Unchained' Comic-Con panel: Tarantino talks links to other movies, Don Johnson talks Foghorn Leghorn|last=Franich|first=Darren|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tarantino finished the script on April 26, 2011, and handed in the final draft to [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Child |first=Ben |title=Tarantino's Django Unchained script: The word is out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/may/05/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-script |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=May 5, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, frequent Tarantino collaborator [[RZA]] said that he and Tarantino had intended to [[Fictional crossover|cross over]] ''Django Unchained'' with RZA's Tarantino-presented martial-arts film ''[[The Man with the Iron Fists]].'' The crossover would have seen a younger version of the blacksmith character from RZA's film appear as a slave in an auction. However, scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation.&lt;ref name="Cross-Over"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyttleton |first=Oliver |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rza-would-have-played-his-character-from-the-man-with-the-iron-fists-in-django-unchained-20121022 |title=RZA Would Have Played His Character From 'The Man with the Iron Fists' In 'Django Unchained' |work=[[IndieWIRE]] |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiG7O7CW?url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rza-would-have-played-his-character-from-the-man-with-the-iron-fists-in-django-unchained-20121022 |archivedate=October 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One inspiration for the film is Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'', whose star [[Franco Nero]] has a cameo appearance in ''Django Unchained''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jun/07/django-unchained-trailer-tarantino? |date=June 7, 2012 |work=The Guardian |author=Child, Ben |title=Django Unchained trailer: will Tarantino be a slave to the dialogue? |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another inspiration is the 1975 film ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'', about a slave trained to fight other slaves.&lt;ref name=bradshaw/&gt; Tarantino included scenes in the snow as a homage to ''[[The Great Silence]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian-30-12-2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Quentin Tarantino: my inspiration for Django Unchained|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/30/quentin-tarantino-inspiration-django-unchained|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=December 30, 2012|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Silenzio'' takes place in the snow. I liked the action in the snow so much, ''Django Unchained'' has a big snow section in the middle," Tarantino said in an interview.&lt;ref name="guardian-30-12-2012"/&gt;

The title ''Django Unchained'' alludes to the titles of the 1966 Corbucci film ''Django''; ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'', the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy film ''Ercole e la regina di Lidia,'' about the mythical hero's escape from enslavement to a wicked master; and to ''[[Angel Unchained]]'', the 1970 American biker film about a biker exacting revenge on a large group of [[rednecks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8765553/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-slavery-spaghetti-western|author= Zach Baron|title=Cinemetrics: Quentin Tarantino's History Lesson: The hilarious but painfully dark truths of 'Django Unchained'|publisher=Grantland.com|date= December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2012/12/in-honor-of-django-unchained-a-look-at-a-dozen-spaghetti-westerns-worth-your-time.html/ |title='&amp;#39;In honor of "Django Unchained," a look at a dozen Spaghetti Westerns worth your time'&amp;#39 |first=Howery |last=Pack |work=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105120309/http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2012/12/in-honor-of-django-unchained-a-look-at-a-dozen-spaghetti-westerns-worth-your-time.html/ |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===

[[File:The Blue Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|Django's valet costume was inspired by [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s 1770 oil painting, ''[[The Blue Boy]]''.]]
In a January 2013 interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', costume designer [[Sharen Davis]] said much of the film's wardrobe was inspired by spaghetti westerns and other works of art. For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television series ''[[Bonanza]]'' and referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by the ''Bonanza'' character Little Joe, played by [[Michael Landon]]. Davis described Django's look as a "rock-n-roll take on the character". Django's sunglasses were inspired by [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[The White Buffalo]]'' (1977). Davis used [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s 1770 oil painting ''[[The Blue Boy]]'' as a reference for Django's valet outfit.&lt;ref name="Costume"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanel |first=Marnie |date=January 4, 2013 |title=From Sketch to Still: The Spaghetti-Western Wit of Sharen Davis's Django Unchained Costumes |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/01/django-unchained-costume-design-oscar-nomination |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final scene, {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} wears a dress similar to that of [[Ida Galli]]'s character in ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'' (1965). Davis said the idea of Calvin Candie's costume came partly from [[Rhett Butler]], and that Don Johnson's signature ''[[Miami Vice]]'' look inspired Big Daddy's cream-colored linen suit in the film. King Schultz's faux chinchilla coat was inspired by [[Telly Savalas]] in ''[[Kojak]]''.

In a scholarly essay on the film's music, [[Hollis Robbins]] notes that the vast majority of film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate ''Django Unchained'' squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema.&lt;ref&gt;“''Django Unchained'': Repurposing Western Film Music.” ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17533171.2015.1057022 Safundi]: the Journal of South African and American Studies'' 16:3 (August 2015): 280-290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Croce]]'s hit "[[I Got a Name (song)|I Got a Name]]" was featured in the soundtrack.

The first teaser poster was inspired by a fan-art poster by Italian artist Federico Mancosu. His artwork was published in May 2011, a few days after the synopsis and the official title were released to the public.

==Reception==

===Critical and scholarly response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 262 reviews and an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring, ''Django Unchained'' is another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino."&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title= Django Unchained |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/django_unchained_2012/ |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher= [[Flixster]] |accessdate= December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 81 out of 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Django Unchained |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/django-unchained |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four and said: "The film offers one sensational sequence after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues." Ebert also added, "had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, this would have been on my year's best films list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2013/01/django_unchained.html |title=Faster, Quentin!

Designating the film a ''Times'' "critics" pick, Scott said ''Django'' is "a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=A. O. Scott|last=Scott|first=A.

To the contrary, [[Owen Gleiberman]], film critic for the ''Entertainment Weekly'', wrote: "''Django'' isn't nearly the film that ''Inglourious'' was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters – or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity – to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=Django Unchained |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20620087,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 31, 2012|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''Indy Week'', David Fellerath wrote: "''Django Unchained'' shows signs that Tarantino did little research beyond repeated viewings of Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western [[Django (1966 film)|''Django'']] and a blaxploitation from 1975 called ''[[Boss Nigger]]'', written by and starring [[Fred Williamson]]."&lt;ref name="david-fellerath"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Fellerath|title=Django Unchained |url= http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/django-unchained/Content?oid=3223359 |work=Indy Week|accessdate=December 31, 2012|date=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Yorker''{{'}}s [[Anthony Lane]] was "disturbed by their [Tarantino's fans'] yelps of triumphant laughter, at the screening I attended, as a white woman was blown away by Django's guns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2013/01/07/130107crci_cinema_lane|title= 'Les Misérables,' 'Django Unchained,' and 'Amour'|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date= January 7, 2013|author=Anthony Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire issue of the academic journal ''Safundi'' was devoted to ''Django Unchained'':{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} "''Django Unchained and the Global Western''," featuring scholars who contextualize Tarantino's film as a classic "western". Dana Phillips writes: "Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite but because it is so very audacious—even, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western, violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, who has never been bashful. Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Dana. "Introduction: Django Unchained and the Global Western". ''Safundi'' 16.3 (2015): 253–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor and activist [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] has contrasted accuracy of the racist language used in the film with what he sees as the film's lack of accuracy about the general lives of slaves, too often portrayed as "well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves&amp;nbsp;... That authenticity card that Tarantino uses to buy all those 'niggers' has an awfully selective memory."&lt;ref name="inchains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/19/opinion/williams-django-still-chained|title=Django, in chains|last=Williams|first=Jesse|date=February 21, 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticizes the lack of solidarity between slave characters, and their general lack of a will to escape from slavery, with Django as the notable exception.&lt;ref name="inchains"/&gt;

[[Marc Lamont Hill]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], compared the fugitive ex–Los Angeles police officer [[Christopher Dorner]] to a real-life Django, saying "It's almost like watching 'Django Unchained' in real life.

Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that "''Django Unchained'' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than ''12 Years a Slave'', but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he’s respected for making supposedly art films, it’s held in higher esteem than ''Django'', because that was basically a blaxploitation movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mattpomroy.com/2018/04/04/samuel-l-jackson-cover-story/|title=Samuel L Jackson cover story|date=2018-04-04|work=MATT POMROY|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of violence====
Some reviews criticized the film for being too [[Media violence research|violent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dershowitz |first=Jessica |title="Django Unchained": Critics weigh in on Quentin Tarantino film |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57560737/django-unchained-critics-weigh-in-on-quentin-tarantino-film/ |publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 26, 2012|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The originally planned premiere of ''Django'' was postponed following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook school shooting]] on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=Matilda |title='Give me a break' – Tarantino tires of defending ultra-violent films after Sandy Hook massacre |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/give-me-a-break--tarantino-tires-of-defending-ultraviolent-films-after-sandy-hook-massacre-8422467.html |work=[[The Independent]]|date=December 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Frank]] criticized the film's use of violence as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that ''Django Unchained'' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving [[sophism|sophistry]] like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or [[Wayne LaPierre|LaPierre]], can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence?&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Frank|Frank, Thomas]] (March 2013) "Blood Sport." ''[[Harper's Magazine]];'' page 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' said the movie was part of "the new sadism in cinema" and added, "There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest [[Garrote|garroting]] or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McNabb, Geoffrey |date=January 11, 2013|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/django-unchained-and-the-new-sadism-in-cinema-8446213.html |title=Django Unchained and the 'new sadism' in cinema|work=The Independent|access-date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Serwer from ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' said, "''Django'', like many Tarantino films, also has been criticized as cartoonishly violent, but it is only so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers. The violence against slaves is always appropriately terrifying. This, if nothing else, puts ''Django'' in the running for Tarantino's best film, the first one in which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz turns his head away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie—the plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio—that Schultz just isn't used to Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Serwer, Adam |date=January 7, 2013|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2013/01/tarantino-django-unchained-western-racism-violence|title=In Defense of Django|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical inaccuracies====
&lt;!--This is not a general trivia section. This section is meant to showcase issues that were brought up in the surrounding media coverage and reception related to the movie. Please see talk page first. --&gt;
Although Tarantino has said about Mandingo fighting, "I was always aware those things existed", there is no definitive historical evidence that slave owners ever staged [[gladiator]]-like fights to the death between male slaves like the fight depicted in the movie.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Rene |title=Tarantino talks 'Django Unchained' |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/21/3152097/tarantino-talks-django-unchained.html |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |date=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223005411/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/21/3152097/tarantino-talks-django-unchained.html |archivedate=February 23, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Was There Really "Mandingo Fighting," Like in Django Unchained? |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/24/django_unchained_mandingo_fighting_were_any_slaves_really_forced_to_fight.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Edna Greene Medford]] notes that there are only undocumented rumors that such fights took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/is-mandingo-fighting-a-real-thing/|title='Django' Unexplained: Was Mandingo Fighting a Real Thing? - NextMovie|work=NextMovie|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Blight, the director of Yale's center for the study of slavery, said it was not a matter of moral or ethical reservations that prevented slave owners from pitting slaves against each other in combat, but rather economic self-interest: slave owners would not have wanted to put their substantial financial investments at risk in gladiatorial battles.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

The non-historical term "Mandingo" for a fine fighting or breeding slave comes not from Tarantino, but the earlier film ''[[Mandingo (film)|''Mandingo'']]''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bernardi, The Persistence of Whiteness: Race and Contemporary ...- 2013 "For the purposes of breeding chattel, he must also buy a "Mandingo" buck, a male slave. In the film, a "Mandingo" represents the finest stock of slaves deemed most suitable for fighting and breeding."{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[William Jelani Cobb]] observed that Tarantino's occasional historical elasticity sometimes worked to the film's advantage. "There are moments," Cobb wrote, "where this convex history works brilliantly, like when Tarantino depicts the [[Ku Klux Klan]] a decade prior to its actual formation in order to thoroughly ridicule its members' veiled racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb|first=Jelani|title=Tarantino Unchained|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/01/how-accurate-is-quentin-tarantinos-portrayal-of-slavery-in-django-unchained.html|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tarantino holds that the masked marauders depicted in the film were not the KKK, but a group known as "The Regulators". They were depicted as spiritual forebears of the later post-civil war KKK and not as the actual KKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holslin|first=Peter|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/quentin-tarantino-and-cast-reveal-django-details-at-comic-con-20120714|title=Quentin Tarantino and Cast Reveal 'Django' Details at Comic-Con|date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Nolan|work=Screenprism|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/is-django-unchained-historically-accurate-and-does-it-matter|title=Q: Is "Django Unchained" historically accurate and does it matter?|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the matter of historical accuracy, [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] wrote in the ''Financial Times'': "Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary", pointing out that the film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. "''Django'' uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us in ''Django'' is violence."&lt;ref name="Tarantino's crusade to ennoble violence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fb2e5468-55b7-11e2-bdd2-00144feab49a.html|title= Tarantino's crusade to ennoble violence|work=[[Financial Times]]|date= January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Brody, however, wrote in ''The New Yorker'' that Tarantino's "vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate....

==In other media==

===Miniseries===
Tarantino has said in an interview that he has 90 minutes of unused material and considered re-editing ''Django Unchained'' into a four-hour, four-night cable [[miniseries]]. Tarantino said that breaking the story into four parts would be more satisfying to audiences than a four-hour movie: "...it wouldn't be an endurance test. It would be a mini-series. And people love those."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/23/quentin-tarantino/9483365/|title=Tarantino wants to make 'Django' TV mini-series|last=Alexander|first=Bryan |work=USA Today|date=May 24, 2014|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
The story which became the director's follow-up film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' was first attempted as a paperback novel sequel to Django Unchained titled ''Django in White Hell''. Tarantino decided, however, that the character's established morals did not fit the tone of the developing story so he began re-writing it as an original screenplay with no connection to the earlier film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/11/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-django-novel |title=Quentin Tarantino explains how Hateful Eight began as a Django novel |last=Staskiewicz |first=Keith |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|location =US |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=January 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has expressed a desire to write a series of Django sequel novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/quentin-tarantino-ridley-scott-four-846682 |title=Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, Four More Directors on the Decline of "Middle-Class Films," Facing Retirement |last=Galloway|first=Stephen |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|location =US |date=December 10, 2015 |accessdate=January 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony is planning on a Django/[[Zorro]] crossover movie, which currently exists in the form of a comic book by [[Dynamite Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/django-unchained-zorro-crossover-movie-2014-12|title=Sony Is Apparently Working On A 'Django Unchained'/'Zorro' Crossover Movie With Quentin Tarantino|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|work=Business Insider|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513022349401011|title=Dynamite® Django / Zorro #1|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameo===
In the 2014 film ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'', Django is seen shooting the proprietor of a racially charged shooting game, saying "people die at the fair". Despite his appearance, the film has no serious connection with Tarantino film and is used mostly for parody and humor.

==Alleged copyright infringement==
In December 2015, a $100 million lawsuit was filed against Tarantino by filmmakers Oscar Colvin Jr. and Torrance J. Colvin, who claimed that the script for ''Django Unchained'' bears extensive similarities to their film, titled ''Freedom''. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-100-million-lawsuit-hateful-eight/ | title=Quentin Tarantino Slapped With $100 Million-Plus Copyright Lawsuit Over ‘Django Unchained’ | work=The Wrap | date=December 30, 2015 | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/31/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-copyright-lawsuit | title=Quentin Tarantino sued for alleged Django Unchained copyright infringement | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=December 31, 2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/10213341/COLVIN_et_al_v_TARANTINO_et_al|title=COLVIN et al v.

'''Edward Calvert''' (20 September 1799 – 14 July 1883) was an [[England|English]] [[printmaker]] and [[Painting|painter]].

He was born in [[Appledore, Torridge, Devon|Appledore]], near [[Bideford]] in [[Devon]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRwHAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Edward+Calvert+Appledore&amp;dq=Edward+Calvert+Appledore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yylIU_PSHaWf7Ab3uYBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ not the other Appledore, Devon]: [[Appledore, Mid Devon]], near [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]].&lt;/ref&gt; and after a spell in the Navy, studied art at [[Plymouth]] and the [[Royal Academy]] (1824). His early visionary work was greatly inspired by [[William Blake]], and he became a member of the Blake-influenced group known as [[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]] which met at [[Samuel Palmer]]'s in [[Shoreham, Kent]] in the later 1820s and early 1830s. Amongst Calvert's finest works are exquisite miniature [[wood engraving]]s which date from this early period; his wood and copper engravings all date from 1827–31, but were only seen by friends until published by his son in 1893 in an edition of 350.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=130282 British Museum biography]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made [[etching]]s.  In 1844 he visited [[Greece]].

Much of his subsequent life was spent with his wife Mary, in [[Dalston]] and nearby [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], a short distance from London. His work from this later period (not considered his best) shows a Classical influence.

Edward Calvert and his wife are buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]]; the headstone reads ''He was welcomed in [[Mount Helicon|Helicon]]''.  The [[British Museum]] has some 65 of his drawings, and about 40 prints, as well as many of the printing blocks and plates for them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results.aspx?searchText=Edward+Calvert&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;productionInfo=on&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=3 British Museum online collection database]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Feminist Press''' is an independent nonprofit literary publisher that promotes freedom of expression and social justice. It publishes writing by people who share an activist spirit and a belief in choice and equality. Founded in 1970, the Press began by rescuing “lost” works by writers such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], and established its publishing program with books by American writers of diverse racial and class backgrounds. Since then it has also been bringing works from around the world to North American readers. The Feminist Press is the longest surviving women’s publishing house in the world. The Press operates out of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).

== Founding and history ==
By the end of the 1960s, both [[Florence Howe]] and her husband Paul Lauter had taught in the [[Freedom Schools]] in Mississippi, and Howe was already attempting to compile a mini-women’s studies curriculum for her writing students at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Kathleen|title=Florence Howe|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/howe-florence#bibliography|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1970s approached, Howe was convinced that, just as she needed texts for teaching about women, so would other educators. Her initial appeal to a number of university and trade publishers to issue a series of critical feminist biographies&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Florence. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/jul/01/feminist-press/?pagination=false "To the Editors"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; proved of no avail. Ultimately, the Baltimore Women’s Liberation, an active local group and publishers of a successful new journal, helped to raise money for the Press’s first publications. On November 17, 1970, the first meeting of the newly formed Press occurred in Florence Howe's living-room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs044/1101707198155/archive/1106954679579.html "VFA Honors the Founder of The Feminist Press Florence Howe"]. Veteran Feminists of America. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to be published was Barbara Danish’s children's book ''The Dragon and the Doctor'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = A Life in Motion | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781558616974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Howe saw her dreams of producing feminist biographies come true with the publication of ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning'' at the end of 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the Press’s founding years, [[Tillie Olsen]] changed its course dramatically by giving Howe a photocopy of the 1861 pages of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' containing [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s anonymously published novella ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Tillie Olsen, Feminist Writer, Dies at 94|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/books/03olsen.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Press issued this work by Rebecca Harding Davis as the first of its series of rediscovered feminist literary classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = Lost and found – and what happened next: some reflections on the search for women writers begun by The Feminist Press in 1970 | journal = [[Contemporary Women's Writing]], special issue: The Body | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–153 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/cww/vpt022 | date = July 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cww/vpt022 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olsen’s second suggestion, ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' by [[Agnes Smedley]], and [[Elaine Hedges]]’s suggestion, ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], were published in 1973, and both of these have become staples of the American literature and women’s studies curriculums since (the 1990 ''[[Norton Anthology of American Literature]]'' included both ''Life in the Iron Mills'' and ''The Yellow Wall-Paper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

In the spring of 1971, Florence and her husband moved to New York.  Howe brought the burgeoning press with her to her newly accepted professorship at Old Westbury.  The President of the school allowed her to operate out of the corridor of a building originally intended as a garage for campus vehicles.  The Press was met with excitement and support from students who worked in the small office in exchange for college work-study.  Two New York City publishing professionals, Verne Moberg and Susan Lowes, contributed to the publication of three volumes of reprinted fiction released in 1972 and 1973, both of which Howe believes to exemplify the Press's enduring commitment to producing course-adoptable books to supplement curriculums dominated by male writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location= |isbn=|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Press continues its commitment to recovering and compiling the important work of otherwise overlooked and unpublished female artists in collections such as ''In Her Own Image''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Elaine | last2 = Wendt | first2 = Ingrid | author-link2 = Ingrid Wendt | title = In Her Own Image: Women Working in the Wrts | publisher = The Feminist Press [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Book Co.]] | location = Old Westbury, New York, NY | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780070204430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Women Writing Africa'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Daymond | first1 = M. J. | title = Women writing Africa, Volume I: The Southern Region | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781558614079 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Feminist Press became a [[501(c)3 organization]] with tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link =|title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1985, the Feminist Press moved to the CUNY campus on East Ninety-Fourth Street following an invitation from the school.  Allowed to maintain an independent staff and board of directors, the Press gratefully welcomed the resources and visibility made available by this partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Jean Casella became the Executive Director of the Press.  She was followed by Gloria Jacobs, former ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' editor, and [[Jennifer Baumgardner]], Soapbox Inc. cofounder. [[Jamia Wilson]] is the current Executive Director of the Feminist Press, appointed in 2017.

== Today ==
Wilson is both the youngest director in the Press's 47-year history and the first woman of color to head the organization. Under her tutelage, the Press continues its commitment to publishing a broad range of voices. However, the Press has also recently endeavored to extend its reaches beyond merely publishing. In doing so, the Press has hosted a variety of events, conferences, and panels centering on key conversations in feminism.

“I grew up reading Feminist Press books from my mother’s shelf, and they were instrumental in developing my voice as an activist and writer. It’s an honor to join this intergenerational team to enliven the Press’s intersectional vision of publishing unapologetic, accessible texts that inspire action, teach empathy, and build community,” Wilson explained upon her appointment as ED.

The Feminist Press remains rooted in the symbiotic relationship between a publication and its readership. In this exchange, a book not only promotes ideas to its reader, but it also inspires new formulations that could ultimately shape future publications.

The Feminist Press has remained current and relevant within the fast-changing world of modern politics and the rapid evolution of feminism. In 2016, the Press started Amethyst Editions, a queer imprint curated by Michelle Tea that champions emerging queer writers who employ genre-bending narratives and experimental writing styles, and complicates the conversation around American LGBTQ+ experiences beyond a coming out narrative. The Feminist Press also established the Louise Meriwether First Book Prize, a literary prize for debut women and nonbinary authors of color, in partnership with ''TAYO'' literary magazine.

== ''WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly'' ==
The Feminist Press also publishes ''[[WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly]]'', an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal. The journal began as ''Women's Studies Newsletter'' in 1972, and in 1981 it was renamed ''Women's Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref name=About_FP&gt;{{cite web|title=About FP|url=https://www.feministpress.org/about-fp/history | publisher = The Feminist Press |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it is a biannual release simply called ''WSQ''.  Covering a wide array of thematic subjects within emerging women's studies, the journal has published issues such as "Technologies," "Citizenship," and "Motherhood."  The subject of each issue is considered through various lenses that may include psychoanalytic, legal, queer, and historical interpretations in addition to many others.

A medical student, Courtney ([[Ellen Page]]), is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife, wanting to find out what happens after death. She invites fellow students Jamie ([[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]]) and Sophia ([[Kiersey Clemons]]) to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds whilst recording her brain, and then reviving her. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they panic as they are unable to revive her, but eventually manage to with the help of fellow student Ray ([[Diego Luna]]). Later, Marlo ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.

Initially Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia’s turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others.

It soon turns into a living horror as those who flatlined find themselves haunted by their visions: Courtney is haunted by her dead sister Tessa from a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend whom he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus (who was stung by jellyfish) whom she killed when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become [[valedictorian]]. They realize there is a downside to flatlining.

The hauntings get more and more intense. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. Shortly after, she is chased by visions of her dead sister and falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost appears in front of her and pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney’s death and then panic when they realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney’s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney’s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. Meanwhile, on his boat, Jaime again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand. 

The group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes that they made and soon come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are their hallucinations because of guilt from their past sins, not paranormal beings. Ray, the only one who didn't flatline, initially disbelieves what's happening. 

The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Later, Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo is suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of the patient that died due to her mistake. Ray, Sophia, and Jamie rush to stop her and are successful in resuscitating Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. In the end, Marlo, Ray, Sophia, and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. The movie ends with Jamie proposing a toast, honoring Courtney.

A '''fly crew''' is a group of people who operate a [[fly system]] from its locking rail during a theatrical production. The responsibilities of a fly crew include bringing [[batten (theater)|battens]] in and out, keeping the fly system linesets in balance, and ensuring that the fly system's [[rope lock]]s are applied when the associated linesets are not moving. Each member of the crew is called a ''flyman''. Large venues will often have several flymen on their fly crews, as well as a [[fly captain]] to manage the crew and plan cues for the fly system.  

During a show, predefined cues may require flymen to operate the fly system at high speeds and with great precision. The scenery used in shows typically weigh up to one ton per batten {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and may be flown in at speeds approaching 30 miles per hour {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and stopped at stage level without hitting the deck. Consequently, the skills of a flyman may take years to master, and flying is often considered an art form in its own right. ''Loaders'' are flymen who work high above the stage in the grid, adding or removing counterweights from the fly system arbors.

==Safety==
The job is often dangerous and carries a high degree of risk due to the large amount of weight and great heights involved. A run-away line, for example, might injure the operator or others in the way of the moving equipment, and a counterweight dropped from the grid could kill or injure a person standing below. When the crew adds or removes counterweights they are often working at heights of six stories or more in the area above a stage known as a [[fly loft]], or grid. Consequently, [[safety harness]]es may be used to protect fly crew members or loaders. Harnesses are not perfect, however, and serious injury can still result should the falling person swing into nearby objects.

==History==
Historically, off-duty [[sailor]]s were used as fly crews in theaters because they had comprehensive knowledge of [[knot]]s and [[rope]]s due to their experience with [[sail]]s. They communicated with one another using high-pitched whistles. Because of this, whistling was not allowed in theaters to prevent it from accidentally being interpreted as a flyrail command. It is still considered 'bad luck' to whistle in a theater.

==Context==

This article uses terms common in the USA.  Different vocabulary may be used in other English-speaking countries.

Retrieved 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is shown in books, and is collected by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], the [[El Paso Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =  http://www.gayblock.com/exhib.html|title = Gay Block CV|date = |accessdate = 13 March 2015|website = Gay Block|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.nmartmuseum.org/view/objects/asimages/People$00404124?t:state:flow=b238d1c4-ae31-46d9-9674-313a8f9d97b2|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Art|accessdate=27 December 2013|title = SAM: Searchable Art Museum|date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Block had been interested in photography since she was a pre-teen, when she started taking pictures of her friends and family using a [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]] box camera.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Texas 100: Selections from the El Paso Museum of Art|last = |first = |publisher = El Paso Museum of Art Foundation|year = 2006|isbn = 0978538307|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 23|editor-last = Dura|editor-first = Lucia}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalls that she enjoyed taking candid photos and collaborating with her subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.gayblock.com/the.html|title = The Universe of Gay Block|last = Block|first = Gay|date = October 2003|journal = THE Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s she began taking pictures of members of her own affluent [[Jewish]] community in Houston.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She later photographed an older Jewish Community of [[retirees]] in [[South Beach|South Miami Beach]], many of whom were [[Holocaust survivor]]s. Block also photographed girls at [[summer camp]]. In 2006, Block re-photographed women who were the girls in her 1981 series from Camp Pinecliffe, twenty-five years earlier.

Block collaborated with author, Rabbi [[Malka Drucker]], and created ''Rescuers: Portraits of Moral Courage in the Holocaust'', both a book and traveling exhibit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Block and Drucker traveled to eleven countries and photographed over 100 [[Christian]]s who had helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exhibit has been seen in over fifty venues in the US and abroad, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|NY]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1992|title = MoMA Exhibitions|date = 2002|accessdate = 13 March 2015|website = Museum of Modern Art|publisher = |last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030220000742/http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1992/|archivedate = 20 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Block's 30-year series of portraits of her mother, in photographs, video, and words, ''Bertha Alyce: Mother exPosed'', was published by [[University of New Mexico Press]] and continues as a traveling exhibit. The book, ''Bertha Alyce'',  was cited as one of "Twelve Great Books Published During The Year 2003" by the editors of RALPH (The Review of Arts, Literature, Politics, and the Humanities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ralphmag.org/CM/dozen-best.html|title = Twelve Great Books Published During the Year 2003|last = |first = |date = 2004|journal = RALPH: The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015|issue = 109|editor-last = Lark|editor-first = Lolita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her video of the material, "Bertha Alyce", was awarded People's Choice and Best Documentary by the Madrid International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, [[Spain]]. The photographs of Bertha Alyce are not considered a conventional representation of a mother/daughter relationship; instead Block's relationship with her mother is unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=12377709&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Gay Block at University of New Mexico Art Museum|last = Reed|first = Arden|date = March 2004|journal = Art in America|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 March 2015|volume = 92|issue = 3|page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block's documentary technique is considered by the critic to be "assured, if reminiscent of Duane Michaels or [[Nan Goldin]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Government College of Fine Arts''' (initially known as the '''Madras School of Art''') in [[Chennai]] is the oldest art institution in [[India]]. The institution was established in 1850 by surgeon Alexander Hunter as a private art school. In 1852, after being taken over by the government, it was renamed as the Government School of Industrial Arts.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/04/03/stories/2009040350570300.htm|title=Where creativity thrives|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|author=Chakravarthy, Pradeep|date=3 April 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, it was renamed as the Government School of Arts and Crafts and the Government College of Arts and Crafts, before finally being renamed as present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/08/stories/2003040800160300.htm|title=Down memory lane|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During British rule in India, the crown found that [[Madras]] had many talented and artistic minds.  As the British had also established a settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royals in [[London]].  At first traditional artists were employed to produce furniture, metalwork, and curios, and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.  The institute established itself as the first school of art in India, predating the [[University of Madras]]. The school was located at Popham’s Broadway. In 1852, it was shifted to its present premises, a four-acre campus on Poonamallee High Road.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

In 1928, Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury joined as its vice-principal and in 1929, he became its first Indian principal. He was the principal until 1957. He was succeeded by [[K.C.S. Paniker]]. Later, a number of noted artists held the role of principal, including R. Krishna Rao, [[S. Dhanapal]], K.L. Munuswamy, A.P. Santhanaraj and [[C.J.Anthony Doss]].

In 1966, former principal [[K.C.S. Paniker]], along with his students and some artists associated with the college, founded the [[Cholamandal Artists' Village]], near [[Chennai]], vwhich is still considered one of the '10 biggest art moments' in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin American art''' is the combined artistic expression of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and [[Mexican art|Mexico]], as well as Latin Americans living in other regions.

The art has roots in the many different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] that inhabited the Americas before European colonization in the 16th century. The indigenous cultures each developed sophisticated artistic disciplines, which were highly influenced by religious and spiritual concerns. Their work is collectively known and referred to as [[Pre-columbian art]]. The blending of Native American, African and European cultures has resulted in a unique mestizo tradition.

==Colonial period==

[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Single canvas depiction of the [[casta]] system of racial hierarchy in eighteenth-century Mexico, by Ignacio María Barreda. Most sets of casta paintings were individual canvases showing only one family.]]
During the colonial period, a mixture of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] traditions and European influences (mainly due to the Christian teachings of [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) produced a very particular Christian art known as [[Indochristian art]]. In addition to [[Native American art|indigenous art]], the development of Latin American visual art was significantly influenced by Spanish, [[Portugal|Portuguese]],  and French and Dutch [[Baroque painting]]. In turn Baroque painting was often influenced by the [[Italian masters]].

(Lit.: Some seventeen-century paintings of Brazil," The Connoisseur, October 1970, page. 130) oil on canvas., 119 x 99&amp;nbsp;cm

The [[Cuzco School]] is viewed as the first center of European-style painting in the Americas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish art instructors taught [[Quechua people|Quechua]] artists to paint religious imagery based on classical and [[Renaissance]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museuhistoriconacional.com.br/ingles/mh-e-104.htm The "Cusquenha" Art.] Museu Histórico Nacional. (retrieved 30 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In eighteenth-century [[New Spain]], Mexican artists along with a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as [[casta]] paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a  secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, [[Luis de Mena]], combines castas with Mexico's [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of single canvas paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, ''Casta Painting'', New Haven: Yale University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century, The Netherlands had captured the rich sugar-producing area of the Portuguese colony of Brazil (1630–1654). During that period, Dutch artist [[Albert Eckhout]] painted a number of important depictions of social types in Brazil. These depictions included images of indigenous men and women, as well as still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ades, "Nature, Science, and the Picturesque" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820–1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific expeditions approved by the Spanish crown began exploring Spanish America where its flora and fauna were recorded. Spaniard [[José Celestino Mutis]], a medical doctor and horticulturalist and follower of Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]], led an expedition starting in 1784 to northern South America, the expedition is known as the ''Expedición Botánica de Nueva Granada''. Local artists were Ecuadorean Indians, who  produced five thousand color drawings of nature, all being published. The crown chartered expedition whose purpose was scientific recording of the natural beauty and wealth of Nature, was a departure from the long traditional religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Catlin, "Traveller-Reporter Artists and the Empirical tradition in Post Independence Latin American Art" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, pp. 43-45, color plate 3.2 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important scientific expedition was that of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and French botantist [[Aimé Bonpland]]. They traveled for five years throughout Spanish America (1799-1804), exploring and recording scientific information as well as the attire and lifestyles local populations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland, Première Partie; Relation Historique: Atlas Pittoresque: 'Vues de Cordillères et monuments de peuples indigènes de l'Amérique', Paris 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humboldt's work became an inspiration and template for continuing scientific work in the nineteenth century, as well as traveller reporters who recorded the scenes of everyday life.

===Historiography of colonial art and architecture===
The history of Latin American art has generally been written by those with training in art history departments. However, the concept of "visual culture" has now brought scholars trained in other disciplines to write the histories of art. As with the history of indigenous peoples, for many years there was a focus on either the pre-Columbian period (Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca) art production, then a leap to the twentieth century. More recently, the colonial era and the nineteenth century have developed as fields of focus. Visual culture as a field increasingly crosses disciplinary boundaries. Colonial architecture has been the subject of a number of important studies.&lt;ref&gt;George Kubler, ''Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century''. 2 vols. New Haven: Yale University Press 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McAndrew, ''The Open-Air Churches of Sixteenth-Century Mexico: Atrios, Posas, Open Chapels, and Other Studies''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Early, ''The Colonial Architecture of Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Early, ''Presidio, Mission, and Pueblo: Spanish Architecture and Urbanism in the United States''. Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Fraser. ''The Architecture of Conquest: Building in the Viceroyalty of Peru, 1535–1635''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wethey, ''Colonial Architecture and Sculpture in Peru''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial art has a long tradition, especially in Mexico, with there being publications of Manuel Toussaint.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Toussaint, ''Arte colonial en México''.  Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, 1948. 5th edition 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on colonial art, with some useful overviews being published in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Bayon and Murrillo Marx, ''History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture''. New York: Rizzoli 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Burke, ''Treasures of Mexican Colonial Painting''.

==Modernism==
[[File:Cristobal Rojas 01.JPG|thumb|''La Muerte de Girardot en Bárbula'', by Venezuelan painter [[Cristóbal Rojas (artist)|Cristóbal Rojas]], oil, 1883]]
[[Modernism]], a Western art movement typified by the rejection of traditional classical styles. This movement holds an ambivalent position in Latin American art. Not all countries developed modernized urban centers at the same time, so Modernism's appearance in Latin America is difficult to date. While Modernism was welcomed by some, others rejected it. Generally speaking, the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] were more open to foreign influence, while countries with a stronger indigenous presence such as Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were resistant to European culture.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. Latin American Art of the 20th Century. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark event for Modernism in the region was, the ''Semana de Arte Moderna'' or [[Modern Art Week]], a festival that took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1922, marking the beginning of Brazil's Modernismo movement. "[T]hough a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the Week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large."

==Constructivist movement==
[[File:Discovery of the Land1.jpg|left|thumb|Brazilian artist [[Candido Portinari]],Study for ''Discovery of the Land'' mural at the [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]
In general, the artistic [[Eurocentrism]] associated with the colonial period began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge their unique identity and started to follow their own path.

From the early twentieth century onward, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It quickly spread from Russia to Europe, and then into Latin America. [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement from Europe, to Latin America.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

After a long and successful career in Europe and the United States, Joaquín Torres-García, returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, where he heavily promoted Constructivism. Attracting a circle of experienced peers and young artists as followers in Montevideo, in 1935 he founded the Asociación de Arte Constructivo as an art center and exhibition space for his circle. The venue was closed in 1940 due to a lack of funding. In 1943, he opened the Taller Torres-García, a workshop and training center that operated until 1962.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"&gt;Barnitz, Jacqueline. ''Twentieth Century Art of Latin America''. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muralism==
{{See also|Mexican muralism}}
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|[[José Clemente Orozco]], Mural ''Omniciencia'', 1925]]Muralism or Muralismo is an important artistic movement generated in Latin America. It is popularly represented by the [[Mexican muralism]] movement of [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. In [[Art of Chile|Chile]], [[José Venturelli]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] were influential muralists. [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] championed muralism in [[Colombia]], as did Gabriel Bracho in Venezuela. In the Dominican Republic, Spanish exile [[José Vela Zanetti]] was a prolific muralist, painting over 100 murals in the country. The Ecuadorian artist [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] (a student of Orozco), the Brazilian [[Candido Portinari]], and Bolivian [[Miguel Alandia Pantoja]] are also noteworthy. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Mexican Muralism "enjoyed a type of prestige and influence in other countries that no other American art movement had ever experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Edward. ''Latin American Art.'' London: Phaidon Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-3980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Muralism, artists in Latin America found a distinctive art form that provided for political and cultural expression, often focusing on issues of social justice related to their indigenous roots.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==''Generación de la Ruptura''==
''[[Generación de la Ruptura]],'' or "Rupture Generation," (sometimes simply known as "Ruptura") is the name given to an art movement in Mexico in 1960s in which younger artists broke away from the established national style of Muralismo. Born out of the desire of younger artists for greater freedom of style in art, this movement is marked by expressionistic and figurative styles. Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas is credited with initiating the ''Ruptura''. In 1958, Cuevas published a paper called ''La Cortina del Nopal'' ("The Cactus Curtain"), which condemned Mexican muralism as overly political, calling it "cheap journalism and harangue" rather than art.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Representative artists include [[José Luis Cuevas]], Alberto Gironella, and Rafael Coronel.
                                                                                            [[File:A.Reveron.png|thumb|A.Reveron]]
===Nueva Presencia===
''Nueva Presencia'' ("new presence") was an artist group founded by artists Arnold Belkin and Fancisco Icaza in the early 1960s. In response to WWII atrocities such as the [[Holocaust]] and the atomic bomb, the artists of Nueva Presencia shared an anti-aesthetic rejection of contemporary trends in art and believed that the artist had a social responsibility. Their beliefs were outlined in the Nueva Presencia manifesto, which was published in the first issue of the poster review of the same name. "No one, especially the artist, has the right to be indifferent to the social order."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; Members of the group included Francisco
Corzas (b. 1936), Emilio Ortiz (b. 1936), Leonel Góngora (b.1933), Artemio Sepúlveda (b. 1936), and José Muñoz, Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio "Nacho" López.

===Otra Figuración===
&lt;!-- [[Otra Figuración]] redirects to this heading. --&gt;
''Otra Figuración'' (Other Figuration) was an Argentine artist group and commune formed in 1961, and disbanded in 1966. Members [[Rómulo Macció]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], and [[Luis Felipe Noé]] lived together and shared a studio in Buenos Aires. Artists of Otra Figuración worked in an expressionistic abstract figurative style featuring vivid colors and collage. Although Otra Figuración were contemporaries of Nueva Presencia, there was no direct contact between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; People who are sometimes associated with the group are [[Raquel Forner]], [[Antonio Berni]], Alberto Heredia, and [[Antonio Seguí]].

==Surrealism==
The French poet and founder of Surrealism, [[André Breton]], after visiting Mexico in 1938, proclaimed it to be "the surrealist country par excellence."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; [[Surrealism]], an artistic movement originating in post-World War I Europe, strongly impacted the art of Latin America. This is where the mestizo culture, the legacy of European conquer over indigenous peoples, embodies contradiction, a central value of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"&gt;Baddeley, Oriana &amp; Fraser, Valerie. Drawing the Line: Art and Cultural Identity in Contemporary Latin America. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely known Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] painted self-portraits and depictions of traditional Mexican culture in a style that combines [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Although, Kahlo did not commend this label, once saying, "They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/9000295/Frida-Kahlo-Surrealist-Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings, and the second-highest for any female artist.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Tai. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/Frieda-9545.html Saint Frida.] ''MetroActive: Books.'' 9 Nov 2005 (retrieved 18 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other female Mexican Surrealists include [[Leonora Carrington]] (a British woman who relocated to Mexico) and [[Remedios Varo]] (a Spanish exile). Mexican artist [[Alberto Gironella]], Chilean artists [[Roberto Matta]], [[Mario Carreño Morales]], and [[Nemesio Antúnez]], Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]], and Argentinean artist [[Roberto Aizenberg]] have also been classified as Surrealists.

==Styles and trends==

===Figuration===
European classical art styles have made a long-lasting impression on the art of Latin America. Into the twentieth century, many Latin American artists continued to be schooled in the traditional 19th-century style, resulting in a continued emphasis on figurative work. Due to the far reach of figuration, the work often spans upon a number of different styles such as [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Pop art]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Surrealism]], only naming a few. While these artists confront issues that range from the personal to the political, many have a shared interest in indigenous issues and the heritage of European cultural imperialism.

===Parody and sociopolitical critique===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|[[José Guadalupe Posada]] (Mexico) ''La Calavera Catrina'']]
Art in Latin America has often been used as a means of social and political critique. Mexican graphic artist [[José Guadalupe Posada]] drew harsh images of Mexican elites as skeletons, [[calavera]]s. This was done prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]], strongly influencing later artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]].
[[File:UsElections Obama Latuff.png|thumb|180px|'' 'McCain - Obama presidential race' '' by Brazilian cartoonist [[Carlos Latuff]]]]

A common practice among Latin American figurative artists is to parody Old Master paintings, especially those of the Spanish court produced by [[Diego Velázquez]] in the 17th century. These parodies serve a dual purpose, referring to the artistic and cultural history of Latin America, and critiquing the legacy of European cultural imperialism in Latin American nations. Two notable artists who frequently employed this technique are [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Alberto Gironella]].

Colombian figurative artist [[Fernando Botero]], whose work features unique "puffy" figures in various situations addressing themes of power, war, and social issues, has used this technique to draw parallels between current governing bodies and the Spanish monarchy. His 1967 painting ''The Presidential Family'', is an early example. The painting, echoing [[Diego Velázquez]]'s 1656 Spanish court painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (The Maids of Honor), contains a self-portrait of Botero standing behind a large canvas. The thick, "puffy" presidential family, decked out in fashionable finery and staring blandly out of the canvas, appear socially superior, drawing attention to social inequality.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"/&gt; According to Botero, his "puffy" figures are not meant to be satirical. He painted a powerful series of canvases, which are based on photos of torture by the U.S. military of Iraqi prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.
&lt;!-- [[File:Abughraib.jpg|thumb|Fernando Botero, ''Abu Ghraib,'' 2005, oil on canvas. Botero painted the abuses of [[Abu Ghraib]] between 2004 and 2005 as a permanent accusation]] --&gt;.
: ''The deformation you see is the result of my involvement with painting. The monumental and, in my eyes, sensually provocative volumes stem from this. Whether they appear fat or not does not interest me. It has hardly any meaning for my painting. My concern is with formal fullness, abundance. And that is something entirely different.''&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Mexican painter and collagist [[Alberto Gironella]], whose style mixes elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[Pop art]], also produced parodies of official Spanish court paintings. He completed dozens of versions of Velásquez's ''Queen Mariana'' from 1652. Gironella's parodies critique the Spanish rule of Mexico by incorporating subversive imagery. ‘’La Reina de los Yugos’’ or "The Queen of Yokes" (1975–81) depicts Mariana with a skirt made of upside-down ox yokes, signifying both Spanish dominance over Mexico's indigenous peoples, and those people's subversion of Spanish rule. The yokes are rendered useless by being upturned. "[Gironella's] hallmark was the use of particular Spanish Grocery cans (sardines, mussels, etc.) in his works, and soda bottle caps nailed or glued around the rim of his paintings."

==Photography==
[[File:GuerrilleroHeroico.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''&lt;br /&gt;Picture taken of [[Che Guevara]] by [[Alberto Korda]] on March 5, 1960, at the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] memorial service.]]

Photographers captured on film, indigenous peoples as well as distinct social types, such as the [[gaucho]]s of Argentina. A number of Latin Americans have made significant contributions to modern photography. [[Guillermo Kahlo]] photographed Mexican colonial buildings and infrastructure, such as the railway bridge at Metlac. [[Agustín Casasola]] himself took many images of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and compiled an extensive archive of Mexican photos. Other photographers include indigenous Peruvian [[Martín Chambi]], Mexican [[Graciela Iturbide]], and Cuban [[Alberto Korda]], famous for his iconic image of [[Che Guevara]]. [[Mario Testino]] is a noted fashion photographer. In addition, a number of non-Latin American photographers have focused on the area, including [[Tina Modotti]] and [[Edward Weston]] in Mexico. Guatemalan national [[María Cristina Orive]] has worked in Argentina with [[Sara Facio]]. Ecuadoran [[Hugo Cifuentes]] has garnered attention.

==Notable Archibald Artists==
There is a surprising number of artists who have been judged finalists more than twenty times. (Many of these have never won the main prize.) These include:
*[[Bill Leak]]
*[[Keith Looby]]
*[[Robert Hannaford]]
*[[L. Scott Pendlebury]]
*[[Jenny Sages]]

== Notable subjects==
&lt;!--It is not clear why this article lists "notable subjects"; given that this is a prize for portraits, hundreds of the subjects are notable. Hence, it is not clear why the following selection of subjects are any more notable than any of the other notable subjects among the finalists. As pages for the finalists for each year are written, the subjects in this list will be moved into those pages.--&gt;

Besides the winners, there have been many hundreds of Archibald finalists featuring portraits of Australian celebrities, including musicians, athletes, politicians, film-makers and artists. Some selected{{by whom?|date=March 2017}} ones: (listed Artist – ''Subject'')

[[File:Kahramanmaras Museum Löwe vorn.jpg|thumb|Front and right side]]
The '''Maraş lion''' is a [[Neo-Hittite|Late Hittite]] sculpture of a lion with a [[Luwian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] inscription. It was discovered on the citadel of [[Kahramanmaraş]] (formerly Maraş) in 1883 and is displayed in the [[Kahramanmaraş Archaeological Museum]]. [[John David Hawkins]] assigned it the name ''Maraş 1'', while [[Winfried Orthmann]] used ''Maraş B/1''.  Massive sculptures of lions are a recurrent feature of [[Hittite art]], especially in the Neo-Hittite period.

== Discovery ==
The lion statue was discovered in 1883 by [[Carl Humann]] and [[Otto Puchstein]] on their Anatolian travels in the castle of ''Marʿasch'' (modern Kahramanmaraş). A second, uninscribed lion which was slightly larger was left ''in situ'' by one of the fortress gates, while the inscribed lion was taken to the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Archaeological Museum]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Maraslöwe in Istanbul.jpg|The lion sculpture in the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Near East (1991)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A plaster cast was produced for the Berlin Museums.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Humann, Otto Puchstein: ''Reisen in Kleinasien und Nordsyrien.'' Dietrich Reimer, Berlin 1890 pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391&lt;/ref&gt; After many years, the lion was transferred to the Kahramanmaraş Archaeological Museum on 30 August 2013, at the initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (''Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Kahramanmaras Museum Löwe Schild.jpg|Information plaque in the museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture has been analysed by numerous scholars, including [[Ekrem Akurgal]], [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]], John David Hawkins and Winfried Orthmann.

== Description ==
The basalt sculpture is 0.41 metres high, 0.73 m long and 0.23 m wide. It is in very good condition. The head and the front legs are fully carved in the round; the left side is carved in high relief upon the inscribed plaque between the feet and the body. The right side, backside, left hindquarters and the tail are unworked, probably because they were not visible in the statue's original location by a door or next to another statue. This flat surface continues in a platform on the lion's back. Hawkins therefore suggested that the line was the pedestal for a statue.

The round head shows [[Assyria]]n influence. Eyes, nose and ears are clearly recognisable. The open mouth is lined with a row of teeth; the largest fangs collide with each other. The stylised mane stretches to its shoulders and halfway down his front legs. Chest hair is also visible in diamond-shaped tufts. Claws and toes are clearly worked on the front paws and are also visible on the back legs.

Above the left front leg, in the mane, there is a flat recessed area with a badly damaged figure of a man standing on an animal (probably a lion). This might be the author of the inscribed text. Hawkins understands it as the text's introductory ''amu-figure'' - ''amu'' being the Luwian hieroglyphic EGO-symbol ("I"). A six line hieroglyphic inscription begins to the right of this figure, which runs all the way to the lion's tail and continues in a [[Boustrophedon]] style over the entire body of the lion and the flat space between its legs. The text breaks off between the front legs at the beginning of a seventh line; it is assumed that the text continued on another surface, either on a statue standing on the lion's back or on a second lion.&lt;ref&gt;The other lion found in the citadel is stylistically similar and therefore dated to the same time, but it is uninscribed and cannot be the twin of this line, since it is a different size.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inscription, the author is named as ''Halparuntiyas, King of Gurgam, son of Laramas, grandson of Halparuntiyas, great-grandson of Muwatalli...''. He declares his loyalty to the gods, especially [[Tarhunzas]] and [[Kurunta (god)|Runtija]], as well as his veneration of his ancestors, and then he describes his deeds. From the list of ancestors it is possible to identify the ruler as [[Halparuntiyas III]], king of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of [[Gurgum]], whose capital lay on the location of modern Kahramanmaraş. The depiction of the ruler standing atop a lion probably indicates his posthumous divinisation, suggesting that the statue was made in or after the reign of Halparuntiyas III, at the end of the 9th century BC.

{{Maya civilization}}
In [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], ceremonial dance had great importance. However, since dance is a transient [[art]], it is inherently difficult for [[Archaeology|archeologist]]s to find and evaluate evidence of its role. There is little material information left behind, beyond a few paintings on murals and vases. This lack of direct evidence leads to several different archaeological interpretations.

[[Dance]] was a central component of social, religious, and political endeavors for the ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. The entire community danced, including [[ajaw|kings]], [[Nobility|nobles]], and common people. Dance served many functions such as creating [[Hierotopy|sacred space]], closing the gap between here and the otherworld, and releasing the dead from the grasp of the Xibalbans (see [[Xibalba]]).

==Research==
In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[Elizabeth P. Benson]] described a dancing scene showing several important [[lord]]s standing with one heel raised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1992, [[Nikolai Grube]] deciphered the [[glyph]] for “dance” (read as ''ak’ot'') in [[Maya script]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some interesting depictions of Maya dance of the Classic era are found on [[Maya ceramics]] and in the famous murals of [[Bonampak]].

The word was in a picture that depicts [[Bird Jaguar IV]], a [[Yaxchilan]] ruler, in a pose that would be described as dancing holding a writhing snake. The words around the man read chan chan or “celestial snake”. Many of the texts or stelae would be installed on places that the performance the picture had captured would be ideally done at like platforms, plazas or stairways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Looper, George, Matthew. (2009) ''To Be Like Gods, Dancing in Ancient Maya Civilization''. University of Texas Press,&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancing on designs has been hard to find at first. It has been discovered that pictures of people dancing have been found to be standing still in the pictures or with a leg raised and just barely touching the ground. The physical location of where the image is gives hints to its reason. Symbols around and in the image also give helpful hints to the decoding of the image. Some depictions of dances come in a story like format around temples, like the 40 days after Bird Jaguar IV’s accession which spans many panels and includes a few different temples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Technique==
Ancient Maya dance is often characterized by transformations of human beings into supernatural (god like) beings by means of visionary [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].  Some think that [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic drugs]] or  medicines were used to put the performer into an altered state of [[mind]]. Once in this state of mind the participants were transformed into their ''[[wayob]]'' or soul companions. These [[soul]] companions were depicted through the [[mask]]s and the costumes people wore in the dance. Some scenes are painted on [[pottery]] such as that from the myriad ritual meals of Classic festivals. These vessels depict humans, both kings and nobles, dressed in costumes.  Their human faces are shown in cutaway view inside the costumes of the fantastic creatures they have become through the transformation of the dance. Some of these ''wayob'' are recognizable as animals like [[jaguar]]s and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], but others just look like strange [[monster]]s.

For the Maya, dance was a very public affair. It induced visionary trances where either individuals or groups went into an altered state of mind that allowed them to communicate with the other world. Those who were strong enough to travel there, told stories about how the land had things like [[river]]s and [[tree]]s in this [[earth|world]]. Some of the great lords depicted themselves dancing out over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]] that leads into the otherworld.

The distinction between the humans and [[supernatural]] beings was never sharply made. Through dance, [[people]] became [[god]]s and gods became people even if it were only for a moment. It is important to note that these were more than just acts of civic [[pride]] or [[piety]]. They were considered to be direct connections to the otherworld.

With the written form of dance poses play a big part on how they describe and depict the dance. The gesture of holding the double headed serpent would be described as a gesture of concentration, calm and tranquility. The pose to dancing was discovered to be a lifted heel while still touching the ground. This was discovered in 1911 but wasn’t brought to questions till 1981 by Virginia Miller who defined the pose. This pose was started in the Early Classic period on a small scale while in the eight century started to appear in large scale depiction. This pictures show one heel raised, very rarely is both raised, and the arms in a dynamic pose with the body gazing outwards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
Dance from pre-Columbian Maya culture still exists in various altered forms today. However, dancing in the ancient world carried a much deeper significance in their sophisticated culture. Records of these dances have come to light through various [[mural]]s, codices, and especially the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] who first recorded their observations. 
	
[[Spirit]]s of the super-natural world and their relationship with [[Maya civilization|Maya culture]] played an important role in [[ritual]] dance. Just as well, [[Megafauna|beasts]] were usually [[Mimicry|mimicked]] in ceremonial dance. The attire worn to some dances as depicted in murals show the links Maya dancers make to the natural world and to their worshipped gods who often took the form of animals. This is evident especially in the frescoes of [[Bonampak]].
	
The elements as well were worshipped through Maya dance. In the [[Tz'utujil people|Tzutujil]] Maya culture, it was believed that a spirit controlled the power of [[volcano]]es. When the [[mountain]] began to grumble and shake, the Tzutujil [[priest]]s would pick young women and [[girl]]s who would partake in a large dance ceremony before being sacrificed into the burning mountain. Maya dance rituals often included [[sacrifice]]. For instance, the Tun-teleche¬ dance included victims whose [[heart]]s were removed before they died as a gift to [[underworld]] [[demon]]s. On the other hand, some public ritual dances were even [[Eroticism|erotic]] in nature. Common throughout most all dances though was the importance of [[Maya death gods|deities]] and the relationship between man and god.  
	
Dancing includes many different aspects of other rituals into the moves and actions they do during them. [[Bloodletting|Blood-letting]] was used to help demonstrate the bravery of the warriors. They would also put their captives in their dances; the captives would be killed in a public ritual normally after the bloodletting. Ball games were also involved in dances. Some ball players would be in similar positions as dancers’ sometimes confusing people analyzing them . Instruments were also including in depictions of ball games further supporting the connection of dancing, ball games, and warfare are connected in the life style as they all share very similar depictions of what they are.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
	
In the [[Creation myth|book of creation]], ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', it is recounted that the dances of the Twin Brothers were part of a miracle ceremony. Just as well, the dances of ‘[[Armadillo|The Armadillo]],’
‘[[Nightjar|the Poorwill]],’ and ‘[[Weasel|the Weasel]]’ pleased the lords of [[death]] immensely.
	
Dance in Maya culture has also acted as a bridge between the ancient and post-Columbian eras. [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish missionaries and lords]] as late as the 18th century were trying to eliminate the practice of ancient dance; however, natives maintained roots with their [[ancestor]]s by practicing in secret. Even after the relatively complete conversion to [[Catholicism]] after the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] influence arrived, Maya people still respect their ancient deities through ceremonial dance, which has persisted through the generations since the golden age of ancient Maya.

== Writing of Dance ==
The “stepping” pose is also closely connected to dance. This pose is a profile of the person with their right foot on the ground while the left is bent with the ball if the foot on the ground. This pose uses lots of context to discover the meaning. This pose could also be used for walking but the presence of instruments and dance costumes separate the two from each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The legs aren’t the only part of the body that mattered when it comes to dance poses. The arm and elbow were used while the hand and fingers are not always shown  while almost all people are shown with arms. One dance position of the arms is the arms out towards the way the person is facing or next to the face while another one is a hand by the head with the other on the hip. The arms would be used of the artist didn’t want to raise the heel of the person while still giving the [[symbol]] of dance. The use of just arms as a form of dance is used to show the dancing of someone who isn’t normally a dancer, like a baby or a [[Gods|god]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With all things there are situations that break the pattern. If the poses for dance are used without certain contexts the meanings of these poses changes. A lifted heel without [[Musical instrument|instruments]] or dance costumes could be used to describe [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]]. Warriors and battles also use this pose as a sign to capture enemies as well as to signal a [[spear]] being thrown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Meanings within dances==
The Snake Dance was also celebrated by the lords of [[Palenque]]. This time the dance was done with a male who has an ax in one hand and a serpent in the other, and a woman who is grasping the lower body of the snake.  These dancers wore costumes of [[First father]] and [[First Mother]], the deities whose actions enabled the final [[Creation myth|creation]] and the birth of all the [[gods]]. This depiction is thought to point toward the role of dance in the story of Creation.

The most important instrument of mayan music is the rain stick.

The story of the [[Popol Vuh]] exhibits examples of this idea.  After the [[Hero Twins]] are killed they come back to life as vagabonds and quickly enchant the people of [[Xibalba]] with their dancing and magic.  The Twins danced such dances as the Dance of the [[Poorwill]], the [[Weasel]] and the [[Armadillo]] and they are able to bring things back to life.  All of this fame caught the attention of the [[Lords of Death]] who command the Twins to perform.  As the twins perform, the Lords are amazed by their powers and finally ask the Twins to sacrifice them.  The Twins do, but this time they do not bring them back to life, limiting the Xibalbans power over humans forever.

Dancers are very specific on where they do their rituals. Certain dances are more private while other are public events that fill stadiums. One [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Exploration|explorer]] describes a performance he watched as eight hundred heavy warriors danced in a giant stadium. Not one of the warriors were off beat as they danced all day with food and drink brought to them as they danced. Diego Garcia de Palacio compared a courtyard enclosed by stairways in [[Copán|Copan]] to the [[Colosseum]] in Rome. Dances were mostly public rituals showing community by people being different social classes on stage. These stages were normally large centers, public zones or palace compounds which the elites would use more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Much of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ceremonial architecture contains pieces of art containing figures doing ritual dances. The architect of these building holds figures of what the rooms are normally used for. Some set of staircase contain pictures of captives walking down them giving the idea the rooms here were used to store prisoners. The East Court of the [[Acropolis]] in Copan is believed to have been used for dance rituals. The room was used by a dictionary of colonial Yucatec described the acropolis as a community house where they learned to discuss public interest and well as learn to dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Microsymphony''''' is a single-movement composition for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Charles Wuorinen]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] and was completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Charles Wuorinen|Wuorinen, Charles]] (1992). [http://www.charleswuorinen.com/compositions/microsymphony/ Microsymphony]. Retrieved March 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece was a finalist for the 1994 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Others Recommended for Pulitzers |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 13, 1994 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-13/news/mn-45543_1_los-angeles-times |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suzuki |first=Dean |title=View from the West: New Hope for the Pulitzer |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=August 1, 2003 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/view-from-the-west-new-hope-for-the-pulitzer/ |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The ''Microsymphony'' has a duration of roughly 11 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].  The seemingly contradictory title refers to the composition's relatively brief length, which is uncommon for a traditional [[symphony]].

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising four [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (4th doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s in C, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

The '''''Miracle of the Cross at the Bridge of S. Lorenzo''''' (Italian: ''Miracolo della Croce caduta nel canale di San Lorenzo'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Gentile Bellini]], dating from 1500. It is now housed in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]].

==History==
[[File:Teleri della scuola di san giovanni ev., Gentile Bellini, Miracolo della Croce caduta nel canale di San Lorenzo (1500) 03.JPG|thumb|280px|Detail.]]
The painting was commissioned for the Grand Hall of the  [[Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista]], the seat of the eponymous brotherhood in Venice. The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, [[Perugino]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Mansueti]], [[Lazzaro Bastiani]] and [[Benedetto Rusconi]]. 

The subject of the paintings were to be the miracles of a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. The item had been donated to the brotherhood by [[Philippe de Mézières]] (or Filippo Maser), chancellor of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] in 1369, and soon became the object of veneration in the city.

The canvasses were all executed in 1496-1501. All survive today, aside from that by Perugino, and are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia.

==Description==
The work portrays a miracle which took place during one of the yearly processions of the [[True Cross]] of the Scuola. The relic fell in the water: it subsequently escaped all the attempts of people to catch it, aside from that of Andrea Vendramin, the ''Gran Guardiano'' ("Grand Guardian") of the school.

The painting shows a meticulous  depiction of the ''canale'' and the bridge near which the reported miracle occurred, and of a number of people who assist to it. The recognizable characters include [[Caterina Cornaro]], queen of Cyprus. Some suppose she is among the kneeling women on the left; however, Catherine Cornaro is the first woman on the left (standing, with a girl to her left). She is praying. The group of gentlemen is perhaps that of Bellini's family, including his self-portrait and that of his brother [[Giovanni Bellini|Giovanni]].

At the centre is the Bridge of San Lorenzo ("St. Lawrence Bridge"), full of people who are looking at the event. The ''fondamente'' (the  roads which flank the Venetian channels) are also crowded, with some people coming on [[gondola]]s. Some people have dived and a woman, on the right, is pushing her moorish slave to do the same: however, Andrea Vendramin  has already grabbed the relic and is carrying it to the shore.

The buildings are painted with accurate colors, although with no [[geometrical perspective]]. Some of them feature the typical inverted cone chimneys of medieval Venice.

The '''''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''''' (frequently abbreviated '''MGH''' in bibliographies and lists of sources) is a comprehensive series of carefully edited and published [[primary source]]s, both [[chronicle]] and [[Archives|archival]], for the study of [[History of Germany|German history]] (broadly conceived) from the end of the [[Roman Empire]] to 1500.&lt;ref name=Holland1910&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.).  The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]] (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]] (1813-1886) .

==History==
The MGH was founded in Hanover as a private [[text publication society]] by the [[Prussia]]n reformer [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]]. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, ''Sanctus amor patriae dat animum'' ("Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit") is explained as linking [[Romantic nationalism]] with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in [[Berlin]]. 

In 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the ''Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of [[World War II]]. 

However, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings.&lt;!--Inhaltlich deckt die Bibliothek bzw. der frei zugängliche OPAC die mittelalterliche Geschichte Deutschlands und Europas mit Berücksichtigung der Kirchengeschichte ab.

The project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.

==Divisions==
The series falls into five main divisions, ''Antiquitates'', ''Diplomata'', ''Epistolae'', ''Leges'' and ''Scriptores'', with an additional smaller division of ''Necrologia''. Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (''Scriptores in usum scholarum'') and special studies (''MGH Schriften'').

'''Oliver Joseph St John Gogarty''' (17 August 1878 – 22 September 1957) was an Irish poet, author, [[otolaryngologist]], athlete, politician, and well-known conversationalist. He served as the inspiration for [[Buck Mulligan]] in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

==Life==

===Early life===
Gogarty was born 17 August 1878 in [[Parnell Square|Rutland Square]], Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a [[Galway]] mill owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/7adc675723754|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later.  Gogarty's father, himself the son of a medical doctor, had been educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other [[Irish Catholic]] families at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 Gogarty's father died of a [[Appendicitis|burst appendix]], and Gogarty was sent to [[Mungret College]], a boarding school near [[Limerick]]. He was unhappy in his new school, and the following year he transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in Lancashire, England, which he liked little better, later referring to it as "a religious jail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= It Isn't This Time of Year at All! |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1954 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location= New York |page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at [[Clongowes Wood College]] while studying for examinations with the [[Royal University of Ireland]]. He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the [[Preston North End FC]] Reserve, and while at [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] he played for the [[Bohemian FC]].  He also played on Clongowes's soccer and [[cricket]] elevens.  His extracurricular interests, which also included cycling and drinking, prevented him from being an attentive student, and in 1898 he switched to the medical school at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], having failed eight of his ten [[examinations]] at the [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===University days===
As one of [[Dublin]]'s "[[medical student|medicos]]", Gogarty was known to be fond of public [[pranks]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; and midnight carousing in "the Kips", Dublin's red-light district.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; He had a talent for [[light poetry|humorous]] and [[ribaldry|bawdy verse]], which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed [[mnemonic]] lyrics to aid his [[medical school|medical studies]].  He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 24–25, 39&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in [[Irish nationalism]] after meeting [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to ''[[United Irishman|The United Irishman]]'' over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSJGogarty1897.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1897]]

A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity.  His witty conversation made him a favourite with the [[university don|dons]], particularly [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] (formerly the tutor of [[Oscar Wilde]]) and [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell]], and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse.  In 1900 he made the acquaintance of [[W. B. Yeats]] (of whom his mother highly approved) and of [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] (of whom she did not) and began to frequent [[Celtic revival|Dublin literary circles]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as [[Seamus O'Sullivan]] and [[James Joyce]].  In 1904 he spent two [[academic term|terms]] at [[Oxford]] to compete for the [[Newdigate Prize]], but lost to [[George Bell (bishop)|G.K.A. Bell]], the future [[Bishop of Chichester]], who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Joyce Martello Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The Tower in Sandycove]]

Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the famous [[James Joyce Tower|Martello Tower in Sandycove]].  The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to "house the Bard" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required "a year in which to finish his novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Many Lines to Thee |last= Carens |first= James |year= 1972 |publisher= Dolmen Press |location= Dublin |page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so.  Joyce briefly took up residence in the [[James Joyce Tower|Tower]] the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]])'' but left again suddenly after only six days.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C. Trench's midnight antics with a loaded [[revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mourning Became Mrs. Spendlove |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1948 |publisher= Creative Age Press |location= New York |pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of Gogarty's motives,&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 842&lt;/ref&gt; and their friendship was never fully renewed.  Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially held the lease until 1925.

In 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication ''The Venture'' and in [[William Kirkpatrick Magee|John Eglinton]]'s journal ''Dana''.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in George Moore's 1905 novel ''The Lake'', an occurrence which upset Gogarty's devout mother.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of [[Arthur Griffith]]'s [[Sinn Féin]], a [[nonviolent revolution|non-violent political movement]] with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical career and family===
[[File:Nollgogarty.jpg|thumb|right|Noll Gogarty, painted by [[William Orpen]]]]
In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning [[Connemara]] family.  Eager to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother.  In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as "Noll") was born, and in autumn of that year Gogarty left for [[Vienna]] to finish the practical phase of his medical training.  Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, [[Robert Henry Woods|Sir Robert Woods]], Gogarty had decided to specialise in [[otolaryngology]], and in [[Vienna]] he studied under [[Ottokar Chiari]], Markus Hajek, and [[Robert Bárány]].

Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore.  Three years later, he joined the staff of the [[Meath Hospital]] and remained there for the remainder of his medical career.  He became known for flamboyant theatrics in the [[operating room]], including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of recently removed [[larynx]]es at the viewing gallery.  He also maintained [[otolaryngology|ENT]] consulting rooms in [[Ely Place]], attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, [[Dermot St. John Gogarty|Dermot]] (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renyvle House, a large [[country house]] in [[Renvyle]], [[Connemara]].  He became a keen [[motorist]] during this time, purchasing a succession of [[cars]] that culminated with a buttercup-coloured [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a [[pilot's licence]] and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free State Senator===
As a [[Sinn Féin]]er during the [[Irish War of Independence]], Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-[[Black and Tans|Black and Tan]] schemes, allowing his home to be used as a [[safe house]] and transporting disguised [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteers in his car.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[ratification]] of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Gogarty sided with the [[Irish Free State|pro-Treaty government]] (headed by his close friend [[Arthur Griffith]]) and was made a [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senator]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1338&amp;ConstID=214|title=Dr. Oliver St. John Gogarty|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside.  His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that "he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so very, very much attached to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Irish Literary Portraits |last= Rodgers |first= William |year= 1973 |publisher= Taplinger Publishers |location= New York |page= 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty carried out Griffith's official [[autopsy]] and [[embalmment]], and went on to perform the same offices for [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination.  It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], but in his absence the post went to [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gogarty1922.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1922]]

In November 1922, anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] commander [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] issued a general order to his forces to shoot [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senators]].  Two months later, Gogarty was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick patient.  Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near [[Chapelizod]] and held under armed guard.  Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from [[diarrhoea]]), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]; he then swam to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in [[Phoenix Park]].  In February of that same year, [[Destruction of Irish country houses (1919-1923)|Renvyle was burnt to the ground]] by anti-Treaty forces.  Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until February 1924.  Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the [[River Liffey]] in gratitude for his life.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 194–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims.  He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the [[British Commonwealth]] so as to "keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen."  He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, [[reforestation]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]], prevention of livestock cruelty, and [[educational reform]].  His views on controversial issues such as censorship and [[birth control]] were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms ("I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women"), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases.  He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) pp.112–113&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches frequently contained [[pun]]s, wordplays, and extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] statue in [[Phoenix Park]] included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website. Seanad Éireann Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929—Report. Tithe an Oireachteas. 19 August 2009. {{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607135429/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the [[Irish language]] (which he referred to as "Woolworth's Irish"), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website.

[[Éamon de Valera|De Valera]] eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.246–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary endeavours===
Gogarty maintained close friendships with [[W. B. Yeats]], [[George William Russell|AE]], George Moore, [[Lord Dunsany]], [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]], [[Seamus O'Sullivan]], and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the midst of his political and professional duties.  Three small books of poetry (''Hyperthuleana'', ''Secret Springs of Dublin Song'', and ''The Ship and Other Poems'') were published between 1916 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty also tried his hand at [[playwriting]], producing a slum drama (''[[Blight (play)|Blight]]'') in 1917 under the pseudonym "Alpha and Omega", and two comedies (''A Serious Thing'' and ''The Enchanted Trousers'') in 1919 under the pseudonym "[[Gideon Ouseley]]", all three of which were performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and thirties.  His 1924 book of poetry ''An Offering of Swans'' won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|Tailteann Games]], for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning ''Tailteann Ode'' (which he was later to describe as "rather tripe").&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 another book of verse, ''Wild Apples'', was published, and was followed in 1933 by ''Selected Poems''.  Gogarty was also a member of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social functions.  1936 saw the publication of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s ''[[Oxford Book of Modern Verse]]'', which contained seventeen of Gogarty's poems and an introduction proclaiming him "one of the great lyric poets of our age."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed Gogarty himself, who remarked, "What right have I to figure so bulkily?  None from a poetical point of view... [[Sappho]] herself could not have made a more subjective anthology."&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, ''[[As I Was Going Down Sackville Street]]'' (subtitled "A Phantasy in Fact"), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order, the story of Gogarty's Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters sketches.  Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a lawsuit by a Jewish [[art dealer]], Harry Sinclair, who claimed that he and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair, had been [[libel]]ed by the publication.  The two men did not appear as named characters in the book, but some derogatory lines of verse beginning ''"Two Jews grew in Sackville Street"'', written by Gogarty's friend George Redding and included in a scene in the novel, were widely known to refer to the Sinclair siblings.  Harry Sinclair further recognised a reference to his grandfather, described in the text as one who "enticed little girls into his office", an offence of which his grandfather had in fact been convicted.  Gogarty responded to the charges by claiming that the unnamed Jews were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.280–283&lt;/ref&gt; The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that "only ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the witnesses for the prosecution was William Sinclair's nephew-by-marriage, [[Samuel Beckett]], then a little-known writer, who was humiliatingly denounced as a "bawd and blasphemer" by Gogarty's counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett |last= Knowlson |first= James |year= 1996 |publisher= Bloomsbury |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay £900 in damages, plus court costs.  This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the [[stock market crash of 1929]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. II: The Arch-Poet 1915–1939 |last= Foster |first= Robert |year= 2003 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |page= 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt that the verdict had been politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the ''Sackville Street'' imbroglio, Gogarty's output over the next two years was prolific.  In 1938 he published ''I Follow St. Patrick'', a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with [[St. Patrick]]; in 1939 he published ''Tumbling in the Hay'', a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and ''Elbow Room'', another collection of poetry.  In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]], whose autobiography ''The Green Fool'' said of [[Patrick Kavanagh|Kavanagh]]'s first visit to Gogarty's home: "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife."  Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words "wife" and "mistress", was awarded £100 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Patrick Kavanagh |last= O'Brien |first= Darcy |year= 1975 |publisher= Bucknell University Press |location= Lewisburg |page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American years===
With the onset of [[World War II]], Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur [[aviator]], attempted to enlist in the [[RAF]] and the [[RAMC]] as a doctor.  He was denied on grounds of age.  He then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel.  When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for [[American citizenship]], and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United States.  Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time.  His primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on [[Third Avenue]]. He also spent time in [[Vermont]] and in Wyckoff, [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Renvyle Letters |last= Williams |first= Guy |year= 2000 |publisher= Daletta Press |location= Monasterevan |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing.  In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included ''Going Native'', a satire on English social mores, ''Mad Grandeur'' and ''Mr. Petunia'', two period narratives composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and ''Rolling Down the Lea'' and ''It Isn't This Time of Year at All!'', two loosely constructed memoirs.  He also published two books of poems, ''Perennial'' and ''Unselected Poems''; a collection of bawdy verse, ''The Merry Muses of Hibernia'', was planned but never completed.  Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner.  He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.

==Literary portrayal==
[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|right|James Joyce]]
A highly visible and distinctive [[Dublin]] character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore's ''Hail and Farewell'', where he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym "Conan."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous literary incarnation, however, is as [[Buck Mulligan]], the irrepressible roommate of [[Stephen Dedalus]] in James Joyce's ''Ulysses''.  Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by Gogarty,&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous of which, [[The Ballad of Japing Jesus|"The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic) Jesus"]], was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels of 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Other details, such as Mulligan's [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]], his status as a medical student, his history of saving men from drowning, his friendship with George Moore, and the metrical arrangement of his full name (Malachi Roland St. John Mulligan) parallel Gogarty's biography.   Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for ''[[Dubliners]]'' character Ignatius Gallaher and ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'' antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty's name often comes up in Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty's own editors and biographers have complained that these references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in [[James Joyce (biography)|Richard Ellmann's ''James Joyce'']] and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck Mulligan.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 10–21&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested{{who|date=November 2012}} that the speaker of W. B. Yeats's poem ''High Talk'', "Malachi Stilt-Jack", is intended to be a representation of Gogarty.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A pub in the [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in [[Connemara]]. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the [[Tallaght Hospital|AMNCH]], now also bears his name.

[[File:Les trois Parques-Marco-Bigio.jpg|thumb|''The Three Parcae'' (1540-1550), by Marco Bigio, in Villa Barberini, Rome]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], the '''Parcae''' (singular, '''Parca''') were the female [[personification]]s of [[destiny]] who directed the lives (and deaths) of humans and gods. They are often called the [[Fates]] in English, and their [[interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalent]] were the '''[[Moirai]]'''.

==Names and history==
The Parcae controlled the metaphorical thread of life of every mortal and immortal from birth to death. Even the gods feared them, and by some sources [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was also subject to their power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The names of the three Parcae are:
* '''[[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]''' (Greek equivalent ''[[Clotho]]''), who spun the thread of life from her [[distaff]] onto her [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]];&lt;ref name="Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea"&gt;John Day, ''God's Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament'', CUP Archive, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;308.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]''' (Greek ''[[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]''), who measured the thread of life with her rod;&lt;ref name="Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea"/&gt;
* '''[[Morta (mythology)|Morta]]''' (Greek ''[[Atropos]]''), who cut the thread of life and chose the manner of a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Tels de Jong ''Sur quelques divinites romaines de la naissance et de la prophetie'' 1959, pp. 70–77; 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Ramat "Morta" in ''Archivio glottologico italiano'' 40, 1960, pp. 61–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Waszinsk ''Gnomon'' 34, 1962, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant documents referencing these deities are three small [[stelae]] ''(cippi)'' found near ancient [[Lavinium]] shortly after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 4, chapt.&lt;/ref&gt; They bear the inscription:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Neuna fata, Neuna dono, Parca Maurtia dono''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The names of two of the three Roman Parcae are recorded (''Neuna'' = Nona, ''Maurtia'' = Morta) and connected to the concept of ''fata''.&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Tels De Jong ''Sur quelques divinites romaines de la naissance et de la prophetie'' 1959 pp. 67–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Sketches - WGA20439.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Parcae Spinning the Fate of [[Marie de' Medici]]'' (1622-1625) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
Nona was supposed to determine a person's lifespan on the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies lustricus|dies lustricus]]'', that is, the day on which the name of the child was chosen, which occurred on the ninth day from birth for a male and the eighth for a female.&lt;ref&gt;S. Breemer and J. H. Waszinsk ''Mnemosyne'' 3 Ser. 13, 1947, pp. 254–270: on personal destiny as linked to the collation of the ''dies lustricus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recurrence of the [[nundinae]] was also considered a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festus]]'' and as such ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefas|nefas]]'' by some Roman scholars as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cornelius Labeo]], because on it the ''[[Flamen dialis#Flaminica Dialis|flaminica dialis]]'' offered the sacrifice of a goat to Jupiter in the [[Regia]].&lt;ref&gt;Macr. ''Sat.'' I 16, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sources for the Parcae is ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]], II 654, V 532, VIII 452, XV 781.
{{clear}}

Another source is [[Aeneid]] by [[Virgil]], in the opening of Book I.

In mythology the Parcae were located on a higher hierarchical level than the highest gods  :

"''The power of the Parcae was great and extend. Some suppose that they were subjected to none of the gods but Jupiter; while others support that even Jupiter himself was obedient to their commands; and indeed we see the father of the gods, in Homer's Iliad, unwilling to see Patroclus perish, yet obliged, by the superior power of the Fates, to abandon him to his destiny''" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lemprière |first1=John |title=A Classical Dictionary: Containing a Copious Account of All the Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors; with the Value of Coins, Weights and Measures, Used Among the Greeks and Romans; and a Chronological Table |date=1827 |publisher=Collin &amp; Company |page=580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;
	
"''So that we have the clearest evidence of the poet for it, that whatever happens to us is under the influence of the Parcae. Jupiter himself can not interfere to save his son Sarpedon.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wieland ( Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown ) |first1=Christoph Martin |title=Lucian of Samosata |date=1820 |page=723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Driller Killer Pinball Scene Shot to Shot.png|thumb|right|300px|An example of an explicit POV shot from the [[public domain]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Driller Killer]]'', putting the audience into the perspective of the protagonist [[Pinball|playing pinball]] with the top shot coming five seconds before the below shot.]]

A '''point of view shot''' (also known as '''POV shot''', '''first-person shot''' or a '''subjective camera''') is a short [[film scene]] that shows what a character (the subject) is looking at (represented through the [[camera]]). It is usually established by being positioned between a [[shot (filming)|shot]] of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character's reaction (see [[shot reverse shot]]). The technique of POV is one of the foundations of [[film editing]].

==Subjectives==
A POV shot need not be the strict point-of-view of an actual single character in a film. Sometimes the point-of-view shot is taken over the shoulder of the character (third person), who remains visible on the screen. Sometimes a POV shot is "shared" ("dual" or "triple"), i.e. it represents the joint POV of two (or more) characters.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Point-of-view''', or simply '''p.o.v'''., [[camera angle]]s record the scene from a particular player's viewpoint. The point-of-view is an '''objective angle''', but since it falls between the objective and subjective angle, it should be placed in a separate category and given special consideration. A point-of-view shot is as close as an objective shot can approach a subjective shot—and still remain objective. The camera is positioned at the side of a subjective player—whose viewpoint is being depicted—so that the audience is given the impression they are standing cheek-to-cheek with the off-screen player. The viewer does not see the event through the player's eyes, as in a subjective shot in which the camera trades places with the screen player. He sees the event from the player's viewpoint, as if standing alongside him. Thus, the camera angle remains objective, since it is an unseen observer not involved in the action." 
:—Joseph V. Mascelli, ''The Five C's of Cinematography''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques Simplified |first1=Joseph V. |last1=Mascelli |year=1965 |location=Hollywood, Calif. |publisher=Cine/Grafic Publications |isbn=9780960024001 |oclc=566601 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporting narrative elements are required to indicate the shot to the viewer as a POV shot. These may include shot sequencing, [[sound effects]], [[visual effects]] and acting.

==Leading actor POV==
When the [[leading actor]] is the subject of the POV it is known as the subjective viewpoint. The audience sees events through the leading actor's eyes, as if they were experiencing the events themselves. Some films are partially or totally shot using this technique, for example the 1947 [[film noir]] ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'', which is shot entirely through the subjective POV of its central character in an attempt to replicate the first-person narrative style of the [[The Lady in the Lake|Raymond Chandler novel upon which the film is based.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lady in the Lake|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E3DE123EEE3BBC4C51DFB766838C659EDE|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{Update|section|date=March 2016}}
POV footage has existed since the first cameras were mounted in early airplanes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematography.com/articles/aerial_history.asp |title=History of Hollywood's Aerial Cinematography |first=Stan |last=McClain |publisher=cinematography.com |accessdate=2 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020614195440/http://www.cinematography.com/articles/aerial_history.asp |archivedate=14 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars, anywhere a film’s creator intended to take viewers inside the action with the psychological purpose of giving viewers a feel of "What he or she is going through", he or she being a participant in the subject matter. Cameras were increasingly introduced into more difficult experiences.

Though the unit was heavy relative to its manner of use, it was considered hands-free, and worked.

Numerous companies have developed successful POV designs, from [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] video equipment used inside the body during medical procedures, to high tech film and digital cameras mounted to jets and employed during flight. On professional levels, the equipment is well defined, expensive, and requires intensive training and support.

However the race for hands-free POV cameras for use on a consumer level has always faced problems. The technology has had issues with usability, combining lenses with microphones with batteries with recording units; all connected using spidery cables, which proved cumbersome in use when compared to the quality of the end content.

==Notable examples==
In making 1927's ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'', director [[Abel Gance]] wrapped a camera and much of the lens in sponge padding so that it could be punched by other actors to portray the leading character's point of view during a fist fight, part of a larger [[snowball fight]] between schoolboys including young [[Napoleon]]. Gance wrote in the technical scenario that the camera "defends itself as if it were Bonaparte himself. It is in the fortress and fights back. It clambers on the wall of snow and jumps down, as if it were human. A punch in the lens. Arms at the side of the camera as if the camera itself had arms. Camera K falls on the ground, struggles, gets up." In the scenario, "Camera K" refers to Gance's main photographer, [[Jules Kruger]], who wore the camera mounted to a breastplate strapped to his chest for these shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brownlow |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Brownlow |title=Napoleon: Abel Gance's Classic Film |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1983 |isbn=9780394533940 |pages=56–57, 76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CTElUunbKMissQS8-4CoDg&amp;id=6HeGAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=9780394533940&amp;q=%22Camera+K%22#search_anchor |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

POV shots were used extensively by Alfred Hitchock for various narrative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~sallitt/intrarealism.html|title=Point of View and "Intrarealism" in Hitchcock|accessdate=12 March 2014|first=Daniel|last= Sallitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2015}}

The long running British sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV Series)|Peep Show]]'', is filmed entirely in point of view shots.

''[[Enter the Void]]'' (2009) by [[Gaspar Noé]] is shot from the first-person viewpoint, although in an unusual way, since most of the movie involves an [[out-of-body experience]].

The film ''[[Hardcore Henry]]'' (2015) consists almost entirely of POV shots, presenting events from the perspective of the title character, in the style of a [[first-person shooter]] video game. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6hzUZDqoLU&amp;t=87s Deep Web Smooth Criminal]

Nearly the entire film ''[[Maniac_(2012_film)|Maniac]]'', is shot from the murderer's point of view, with his face being shown only in reflections and occasionally in the third person.

'''''Pronkstilleven''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'ostentatious', 'ornate' or 'sumptuous' still life) is a style of ornate [[still life]] painting, which was developed in the 1640s in [[Antwerp]] from where it spread quickly to the [[Dutch Republic]]. 

==Development==
Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals.

The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pronkstilleven Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven]&lt;/ref&gt;  A leading Dutch representative was [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36842 Jan Davidsz. de Heem] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]] developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the [[trompe-l'œil]] compositions for which he was known.  An example is his ''[[:File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|Silverware in an Open Cabinet]]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]].&lt;ref name=gijs&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/collectie/pronkstilleven-in-openstaande-kast Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, ''Pronkstilleven in an open cabinet''] at barokinvlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning==
[[File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|thumb|''Silverware in an Open Cabinet'' by Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]]
Pronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of [[vanitas]] painting that conveys a moral lesson.  The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life.

For instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end.  Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations.  The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tento.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-van-beyeren-pronk-stilleven L.J., Bol, ''Abraham van Beyeren - Pronk-stilleven''] at okv {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rubbing''' (''[[Frottage (art)|frottage]]'') is a reproduction of the [[Surface finish|texture]] of a surface created by placing a piece of paper or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly [[charcoal]] or [[pencil]], but also various forms of blotted and rolled ink, [[chalk]], [[wax]], and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the  technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowsky, D., ''Failure Analysis of Wood and Wood-Based Products'', McGraw-Hill Education; 1st edition (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-07-183937-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses for this technique include:
* [[Brass rubbing]], to make copies of [[monumental brass]]es
* [[Forensic]] uses, including finding out what was written on a sheet of paper removed from a pad by rubbing the impressions left on subsequent sheets or other backing materials
* [[Frottage (art)|Frottage]], a [[surrealist]] art form
* [[Stone rubbing]], to make copies of patterns and inscriptions of gravestones or other incised or textured stone surfaces

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">The '''Salon de la Sécession''' was an [[Avant-gardism|Avant-gardist]] art exhibition which was held in [[Luxembourg]] each year from 1927 to 1930. It was the main event of the Luxembourg Secession movement which had been founded in 1926 by a number of artists including [[Claus Cito]], [[Nico Klopp]], [[Joseph Kutter]] and [[Auguste Trémont]] who were unhappy with the academic approach of the [[Cercle artistique de Luxembourg]] and its support of Impressionism. Hoping to develop interest in [[Fauvism]] and [[Expressionism]], they had been inspired by similar but substantially earlier secessionist movements in [[Munich]] (1892), [[Vienna]] (1896) and [[Berlin]] (1897). The Luxembourg movement folded in 1930 following the reconciliation of the Secession movement and the Cercle artistique.&lt;ref&gt;"Sezession, Luxemburger", ''Luxemburger Lexikon'', Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perrine Pouget, Alice de Lestrange, Jean-Paul Labourdette, Dominique Auzias: "Luxembourg", Petit Futé, 2008, p. 250 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salon's first exhibition was held in Luxembourg's city hall in 1927. The participating artists were Claus Cito, Nico Klopp, Joseph Kutter, [[Jemp Michels]], [[Harry Rabinger]], [[Jean Schaak]], [[Jos Sünnen]], [[Jean-Joseph Thiry]] and Auguste Trémont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onsstad.lu/index.php?id=242&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=80&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1003&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=240&amp;cHash=1164358a19 Georgette Bisdorff, "Claus Cito, der Bildhauer aus Bascharage"], ''Ons stad'' No 60, 1999.

'''Sensory design''' aims to establish an overall diagnosis of the [[Sense|sensory perceptions]] of a product, and define appropriate means to [[design]] or redesign it on that basis. It involves an observation of the diverse and varying situations in which a given product or object is used in order to measure the users' overall opinion of the product, its positive and negative aspects in terms of [[Somatosensory system|tactility]], [[Visual perception|appearance]], [[Hearing (sense)|sound]] and so on.

Sensory assessment aims to quantify and describe, in a systematic manner, all human [[Perception#Types|perceptions]] when confronted with a product or object. Contrary to traditional laboratory analysis, a sensory analysis of a product is either carried out by a panel of  [[Psychological testing|trained testers]], or by specialized test equipment designed to mimic the perception of humans.

The result allows researchers to establish a list of specifications and to set out a precise and quantified requirement. These are applied to materials and objects using various criteria:
* [[Somatosensory system|Touch]], textures, compliance, friction.
* [[Visual system|Vision]] color, luminosity, shape, pattern.
* [[Sound]]s and [[:wiki:movement|movement]]s made when a product is handled;
* [[Olfaction|Smell]];
* [[Taste]];
* [[Temperature]] and perceived thermal properties

==Use in Transportation==
In the [[transport]]ation sphere, these two branches of [[sensory analysis]] translate into sometimes minor enhancements to the design for a vehicle interior, information system, or station environment to smooth some of the rougher edges of the travel experience.&lt;ref name="Railway"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kingsley | first=Nick | title=Railway Gazette: Sensolab drives interior experimentation | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sensolab-drives-interior-experimentation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, specialized air purifying equipment can be used to design a more pleasant odor.&lt;ref name="Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leone|first1=Catherine|title=Come to Your Senses|url=http://www.iida.org/content.cfm/come-to-your-senses|website=International Interior Design Association|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Food and Beverage==
Sensory design plays a critical role the modern food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Howard|title=Sensory and Consumer Research in Food Product Design and Development|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1366-0|edition=2|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813813662.html|date=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The food and beverage industry attempts to maintain specific sensory experiences. In addition to smell and flavor, the color of food (e.g. ripe fruits),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Fernando|title=Calibrated color measurements of agricultural foods using image analysis|journal=Postharvest Biology and Technology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=285–295|doi=10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.04.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521406001116|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture of food (e.g. potato chips) are critical. Even the environment is important as "Color affects the appetite, in essence, the taste of food".&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt;

==Sensory Design Technologies==
While classically limited to the perception of trained sensory experts, advances in sensors and computation have allowed objective quantified measurements of sensory information to be acquired, quantified and communicated leading to improved design communication, translation from prototype to production, and quality assurance. Sensory areas that have been objectively quantified include vision, touch, and smell.

===Vision===
In vision both light and color are considered in sensory design. Early [[light meter]]s (called extinction meters) relied on the human eye to gauge and quantify the [[Luminosity function|amount of light]]. Subsequently, analog and digital light meters have been popularized for photography. Work by Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s lead to a systematic combination of lighting and color samples required to quantify colors by human eye. This became the basis for the [[pantone|Pantone Matching System]]. Combining this with specialized light meters allowed digital color meters to be invented and popularized.

===Touch===
Touch plays an important role in a variety of products and is increasingly considered in product design and marketing efforts and has led to a more scientific approach to tactile design and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=Charles|title=Multisensory design: Reaching out to touch the consumer|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=3 March 2015|volume=28|issue=3|pages=267–308|doi=10.1002/mar.20392|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229911988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical the field of tribology has developed various tests to evaluate interacting surfaces in relative motion with a focus on measuring friction, lubrication, and wear. However these measurements do not correlate with human 
perception.&lt;ref name="Bayesian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fishel|first1=Jeremy|title=Bayesian exploration for intelligent identification of textures|journal=Frontiers in Neurorobotics|date=18 June 2012|volume=6|pages=4|doi=10.3389/fnbot.2012.00004|pmid=22783186|pmc=3389458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods for evaluating how materials feel were first popularized from work initiated at Kyoto University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabrics|url=http://www.kod.tul.cz/laboratore/Kes/index_eng.html|website=Kawabata Laboratory|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309134855/http://www.kod.tul.cz/laboratore/Kes/index_eng.html|archivedate=2016-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kawabata evaluation system developed six measurements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lahey|first1=Timothy|title=Modelling Hysteresis in the Bending of Fabrics|date=2002|pages=17–21|url=http://etd.uwaterloo.ca/etd/tjlahey2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how fabrics feel. The SynTouch Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tactile Characterization|url=http://syntouchllc.com/Services/Tactile-Characterization/|website=SynTouch|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a  system developed using a biomimetic tactile sensor which quantifies fifteen dimensions of touch based on testing over 500 materials.&lt;ref name="Bayesian"/&gt;

===Smell===
Measuring odors has remained difficult. A variety of techniques have been attempted but “Most measures have had a subjective component that makes them anachronistic with modern methodology in experimental behavioral science, indeterminate regarding the extent of individual differences, unusable with infra humans and of unproved ability to discern small differences”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wise|first1=Paul|title=Quantification of Odor Quality|journal=Chemical Senses|date=2000|volume=25|issue=4|pages=429–443|doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.429|url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/429.full|pmid=10944507}}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods for robotic exploration of smell are being proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loutfi|first1=Amy|title=Smell, think and act: A cognitive robot discriminating odours|journal=Autonomous Robots|date=8 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=239–249|doi=10.1007/s10514-006-7098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shock Illustrated''''' was an American black and white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] from late 1955 to early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The artists drew one to four panels per page with the text overlaid onto the artwork. The first issue appeared with a cover date of September–October 1955 and featured three psychology-themed stories, similar in theme to the comic ''Psychoanalysis'' published by EC in 1955. Starting with the second issue this type of story was generally reduced to one per issue, with the remaining stories being similar in theme to those that appeared in EC's comic ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shock Illustrated'' ran for a total of three issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, the company had no choice but to cancel the prints. The third issue of this magazine is known as the rarest EC publication of all time. Although all 250,000 copies had been printed, publisher [[William Gaines|Bill Gaines]] lacked the funds to bind them, and all but 100 copies were destroyed.

==Contributors==
The editor of ''Shock Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. In addition to those stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonym [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by Gaines. This included "A Question of Time" and "Dead Right" in the second issue and "Curiosity Killed" in the third issue. Contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications), Robert Bernstein, John Larner, and [[Daniel Keyes]] (using the pseudonyms Kris Daniels and A.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19729">This is a list and description of the '''guitars and other equipment''' played by musician '''[[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'''. Vaughan played a number of [[Fender Stratocaster]]s throughout his career, one of which, a 1963 body and a late 1962 rosewood (curved fingerboard) neck, became "the most famous battered Strat in rock history."&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;Gregory pp. 124–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was notoriously hard on his guitars, and many of them required extensive periodic maintenance. He used a limited number of (mainly vintage) effect pedals, and favored [[Fender amplifiers|Fender]]&lt;ref name="buchholz"/&gt; and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amplification.&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

Vaughan was hard on his instruments and his equipment and was reported to hear even the slightest malfunction, even when, for instance, he was running 32 amplifiers into the [[mixing console]] for the recording of ''[[In Step]]''.&lt;ref name="guru"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Dave|date=March 1993|title=Gear Guru: Cesar Diaz Reveals the Tech Secrets of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton &amp; Bob Dylan|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=27|issue=3|pages=109–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His guitars were serviced by Charley Wirz of Charley's Guitar Shop in [[Dallas, Texas]],&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt; and especially Rene Martinez, who worked in Wirz's shop for a while.&lt;ref name="buchholz"&gt;{{cite news|title=You can own a guitar like Stevie Ray's|last=Buchholz|first=Brad|date=28 January 1992|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinez also built guitars for [[Carlos Santana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2010/03/four_finger_five_sounds_like_l.html|title=Four Finger Five sounds like Led Zeppelin, Al Green 'fighting for the last woman on Earth'|last=Wedel|first=Mark|date=18 March 2010|publisher=[[Booth Newspapers|Mlive]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His amplifiers were tuned and serviced by [[César Díaz]], also the guitar technician for [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref name="guru"/&gt;

==Number One==
'''Number One''' (also known as Vaughan's 'First Wife') was a  [[Fender Stratocaster]] used by Vaughan for most of his career; it was "rebuilt more times than a custom Chevy."&lt;ref name="buchholz"/&gt; Vaughan always claimed it was a 1959 model, since that date was written on the back of the pick-ups; Rene Martinez, who maintained the guitar since 1980, saw the year 1963 stamped in the body and 1962 on the neck.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;Kitts pp. 102–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The guitar was given to him by the owner of Ray Henning's Heart of Texas music shop in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1973 and was his main performing instrument and companion. Vaughan used the guitar on all five of his studio albums and on ''[[Family Style (Vaughan Brothers album)|Family Style]]''. The distinctive cigarette burn on the headstock comes from an incident when Vaughan had left a burning cigarette tucked under the sixth string for too long while playing.

"Number One" had a neck relief of .012" at the 7th and 9th frets, and leveled out through the remainder of the fingerboard. The fingerboard radius when new would have been 7.25&amp;nbsp;inches as were all pre CBS curved fingerboard Fenders but SRV's guitar ended up after many refrets and sanding of the fingerboard as 10" and used Dunlop 6100 fretwire. String height was measured to be 5/64" on the high E string and 7/64" on the low E string. Each string had 3 full winds for the best angle at the bone nut.

===Neck===
The original neck has a fairly thick D shaped profile. It was not as sometimes stated a "D" width nut (D width was 1{{frac|7|8}} inch - the standard width was B which is 1{{frac|5|8}} - SRV's guitar had a standard B width of nominally 1{{frac|5|8}}). The nut width letter was stamped on the end of the neck on Fender guitars from March 1962. It had a curved rosewood fingerboard and was refretted so often that, after a while, it could not be refretted anymore. Martinez replaced it with the neck from "Red" (see below), an event often said to foretell Vaughan's death. This neck was destroyed when a piece of stage rigging fell on it. After Vaughan's death, the original neck was reinstalled on Number One, and both are now in the possession of [[Jimmie Vaughan]].&lt;ref name="number"/&gt;

===Fender signature model===
[[File:Fendersrvstratfront.jpg|thumb|right|A Stevie Ray Vaughan signature Stratocaster, based on "Number One"]]
Vaughan collaborated with Fender for an ''Artist Signature'' model, based on Number One; already in the works at the time of Vaughan's death, his brother Jimmie asked for the process to be sped up and the guitar became available in 1992. To achieve the sound Vaughan wanted, builder Larry Brooks put 600 windings on the [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides adding to the number of windings, the polarity of the middle pickup was reversed to eliminate [[Mains hum|hum]]. The signature Strat has an alder body with a maple neck and pau ferro fingerboard, and comes equipped with .010-.046 strings (lighter than Vaughan's); it was praised by ''[[Guitar Player]]'' for its neck and "juicy tone": "the SRV is one of the coolest Strats we've ever played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Art|title=Bench Tests: Cool Blues Gear|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=26|issue=8|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yellow==
'''Yellow''' was a 1959 Stratocaster formerly owned by [[Vanilla Fudge]]'s lead guitarist, [[Vince Martell]], who sold it to Charley Wirz. The body had been hollowed out to make room for "a shitload of humbuckers," but Wirz fashioned a new pickguard in which he placed a single Fender Strat pickup in the neck position and painted the body yellow. Wirz gave the guitar to Vaughan in 1982; it is the guitar with the letters "SRV" on the pickguard under the string.&lt;ref&gt;Kitts p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was supposedly the guitar played on the album versions of "Honey Bee" and "Tell Me". Yellow was stolen in 1985 at the [[Albany International Airport]] in New York, but was later recovered and is now on display in the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[Hard Rock Cafe]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Red==
In late 1983, Vaughan purchased a 1962 sunburst Fender Stratocaster from Charley's Guitar Shop, though he had it repainted by Fender in fiesta red as a custom color option, and simply named the guitar "Red." The guitar remained stock until 1986, when a left-handed neck was installed and "SRV" stickers were applied to the pickguard.  In 1989, the neck on "Number One" was unable to withstand more re-fret jobs, replacing it with the original neck from "Red." The next year, following a concert at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center|Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel, New Jersey]], a [[stanchion]] fell onto Vaughan's rack of guitars, splitting the neck from "Red" that was installed on "Number One."&lt;ref&gt;Kitts, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The neck was replaced the next night.

==Hamiltone Guitars==
[[File:Hamiltone Guitars.jpg|thumb|On the left: The 20th Anniversary Hamiltone made by Jim Hamilton]]
'''Hamiltone''' (also known as "Main" or the "Couldn't Stand the Weather" guitar) was a custom Stratocaster-style guitar made for Vaughan by James Hamilton in [[Buffalo, NY]]. It was presented to Vaughan by James as a gift from [[ZZ Top|ZZ Top's]] [[Billy Gibbons]] on April 29, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novan.com/jimspage.htm|title=Hamiltone Guitars|last=Hamilton|first=Jim|publisher=Jim Hamilton|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This guitar features a 2-piece maple body and a 3-piece "neck-through body" design. It also originally had EMG preamped pickups, but Vaughan didn't like the pickups in it. He was about to make next the music video for "Couldn't Stand the Weather", and didn't want to get Number One wet during filming, as that would have ruined the 1959 pickups, so he used the Hamiltone for filming. The EMG pickups and Gibson style amber top hat knobs were changed in June 1984.

The Hamiltone's fingerboard is ebony with a mother-of-pearl inlay that read "Stevie Ray Vaughan". The guitar was originally set to be made for Stevie in 1979, but the plan was dropped when Vaughan started using his middle name "Ray"; he was only known as "Stevie Vaughan" at the time.

==Scotch==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Butter is a 1961 Fender Stratocaster used by Vaughan for the last 5 years of his life. He acquired this guitar in the fall of 1985, and it is said to have been bought in either Baltimore or "The Boathouse" in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. It was to be a prize at one of Stevie's shows, but he bought the guitar instead and gave away another one of his guitars.

This guitar has a butterscotch colored finish with a non-original tiger-striped pickguard made by Rene Martinez, Vaughan's guitar tech. The tiger-striped pickguard resembled the same pickguard [[Buddy Guy]] had on his butter-colored guitar at the time.

"Scotch" was stock except for the tiger-striped pickguard where he added his famous "SRV" prismatic stickers.

==Charley==
'''Charley''' was a white custom-made "hardtail" (non-tremolo, fixed bridge) "Stratocaster-style" guitar built by Charley Wirz, a friend of Vaughan's and owner of Charley's Guitar Shop in Dallas. Wirz built it in late 1983, and placed a neck plate on it engraved "To Stevie Ray Vaughan, more in '84". It had three [[Danelectro]] [[lipstick pickup]]s. This guitar often was used during "Life Without You", which was itself said to be written as a tribute to Charley Wirz.&lt;ref name="ultimate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/the_history_of/stevie_ray_vaughan_part_2_his_guitars.html|title=Stevie Ray Vaughan. Part 2: His Guitars|date=7 February 2005|publisher=Ultime Guitar |accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lenny==
'''Lenny''' is a 1963 or 1964 Stratocaster, bought for Vaughan for his birthday by his wife, Lenora, and several friends because he didn't have the money to buy it.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevieray.com/gear.htm|title=Stevie Ray's King Tone|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally 3-tone sunburst with a rosewood neck, it was later stripped down to a dark natural finish and re-fitted with a mid-'50s-style maple neck reportedly given to him by Billy Gibbons. Behind the bridge, on the lower bout of the guitar body is a unique inlay, thought to be originally from an early 1900s mandolin. The [[Fender Custom Shop]] has produced a limited-edition run of Lenny replicas since December 12, 2007, and they are sold by the [[Guitar Center]] for $17,000. The guitar was mainly used for [[Lenny (Stevie Ray Vaughan song)|"Lenny"]].&lt;ref name="lenny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therockdose.com/stevie-ray-vaughans-lenny-guitar-a-brief-history/|title=Stevie Ray Vaughan’s "Lenny" Guitar: A Brief History|date=5 July 2008|publisher=Rock Dose|accessdate=5 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082946/http://www.therockdose.com/stevie-ray-vaughans-lenny-guitar-a-brief-history/|archivedate=3 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, Lenny was put up for auction and was sold to Guitar Center for $623,500.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; It is on display at Guitar Center's Austin location on Anderson Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.strat-talk.com/threads/stevie-ray-vaughans-lenny-spotted-in-the-wild.443760/|title=Stevie Ray Vaughan's Lenny Spotted in the wild!|work=Fender Stratocaster Guitar Forum|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guild acoustic==
He played a [[Guild]] JF6512 on ''MTV Unplugged'', and on "Life By The Drop" from the posthumous album ''[[The Sky Is Crying (album)|The Sky Is Crying]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Other guitar equipment==

===Strings===
Vaughan was noted for playing extraordinarily thick strings, "as thick as barbed wire,"&lt;ref name="buchholz"/&gt; "sometimes as extreme as a .018 through .074 set."&lt;ref name="licks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gress|first=Jesse|date=December 1993|title=Rock Heart Blues Soul: The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan Licks|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=27|issue=12|pages=100 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not picky on string brand, but favored GHS Nickel Rockers of heavy gauge, partly for tone and partly because his fretting and strumming were so strong he often snapped strings while playing. He changed around gauges often, depending on the condition of his fingers, but always favored, from high to low, .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058. Sometimes he used a slightly lighter high E string (.012 or .011). He always tuned down one half step.&lt;ref name="sound"/&gt;

===Picks===
Vaughan favored Fender Medium picks,&lt;ref name="sound"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1997|title=30 players who changed the way we sound|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=31|issue=12|pages=60–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and played with the round end of the pick, stating the fact that the rounded end allowed for more string attack than the tip.&lt;ref name="king picks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Widders|first=Andy|date=December 1993|title=SRV's 'King Tone' Secrets|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=27|issue=12|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amplifiers==
[[File:1964 Fender Vibroverb.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A 1964 Fender Vibroverb|alt=An image of a 1964 Fender Vibroverb]]
Vaughan used various amplifiers, mainly [[Fender amplifiers|Fender]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]]. He said of his choice that he had it backwards: "I use the Fenders for distortion and the Marshall for clarity." He often used two amplifiers simultaneously, one more [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] than the other.&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

The amplifiers he used on stage included:
* Two "Blackface" [[Fender Super Reverb]]s
* Marshall Club &amp; Country combo amp with 2×12" [[JBL]] speakers&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;
* Two 1964&lt;ref name="guru"/&gt; "Blackface" Fender Vibroverb amplifiers (numbers five and six off production line), each with one 15" speaker&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

From early on his career, beginning in 1979, Vaughan received technical assistance from [[César Díaz]], who began by replacing and tweaking the output transformers on his amplifiers. Vaughan played so hard (especially on the low strings) and his heavy strings produced such "non-standard frequencies" that the amplifiers' [[vacuum tube]]s would occasionally spark and emit smoke, causing the need to buffer the input.&lt;ref name="guru"/&gt;

An oddity about Vaughan's usage was that he preferred the amplifier's dials to always have the same numbers ("Volume at 7, treble at 5{{frac|1|2}}, bass at 4"), and "in order to avoid problems, [Díaz] would back off the volume control by unscrewing the knob and turning it back a bit so it would appear to be at the same level as before."&lt;ref name="guru"/&gt;

===Studio equipment===
On ''[[Texas Flood]]'', Vaughan borrowed a [[Dumble Amplifiers|Howard Dumble]] amplifier from [[Jackson Browne]], and he later bought a 150-watt Dumble Steel String Singer. Besides Dumble,&lt;ref name="dumble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevieray.com/gear.htm|title=Stevie Ray - Gear|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also used [[Mesa Boogie]] amplifiers and a Groove Tubes [[Preamplifier|pre-amp]].&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

After he kicked his addictions, Vaughan became especially obsessed with the sound produced by his amplifiers. During the rehearsals for ''[[In Step]]'' in New York City, Díaz brought 32 amplifiers, as well as 200-watt Marshall 4×15" bass cabinets. According to Díaz, "the whole studio was taken up with amps--upstairs, downstairs, every room was filled with amps. So he would hit these notes, and the whole place would rattle."&lt;ref name="guru"/&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:1968 King Vox Wah pedal.JPG|thumb|100px|A 1968 King Vox Wah pedal.]]
Vaughan typically used an [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]] (various kinds—the TS-808, TS9, and TS10&lt;ref name="Kitts p. 116-17"&gt;Kitts p. 116-17.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a [[Leslie speaker|Leslie revolving speaker]].&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chappell p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally he used a Fender Vibratone (aka. Leslie 16/18. A Leslie speaker especially designed for guitar), and a [[Fuzz Face]] and [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]].&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; His standard [[Wah-wah pedal|wah pedal]] was a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]],&lt;ref name="Kitts p. 116-17"/&gt; sometimes two simultaneously.&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of unconsciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] that portrays an individual's point of view by transcribing the author's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dialogue or ''[[somniloquy]]'' during sleep, in connection to his or her actions within a [[dream]].&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 5: Recent Sleep Works." ''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4631">'''Symphony No. 1''' is a four-movement [[orchestra]]l composition by American composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].  The work was jointly commissioned in 1940 by [[CBS]] and the [[New York Philharmonic]] and was completed March 29, 1941, though Herrmann revised the work in 1973.  It premiered July 27, 1941 at the [[CBS Radio]] Theater, with Herrmann conducting the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra|CBS Symphony Orchestra]].  Though he would continue to compose [[Classical music|concert music]] and [[film score]]s throughout his later life, the symphony would be Herrmann's last foray into [[Absolute music|nonprogrammatic]] music.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four movements:&lt;ref name="FSM"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Mark |title=Herrmann Centennial Concert Work Series: Symphony No. 1 |work=[[Film Score Monthly]] |date=March 8, 2011 |url=http://filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm/articleID/6634/Herrmann-Centennial-Concert-Work-Series--Symphony-No.-1/ |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Maestoso: Allegro pesante
#Scherzo
#Andante sostenuto
#Rondo: Epilogue à la processional
On the experience of composing [[absolute music]], Herrmann said, "For the first time I was not confined to the outline of a story. It was not necessary to depict waves, portray the anguish of a lost soul, or look for a love theme... Consequently, working on the Symphony I had a Roman holiday."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Albert Imperato of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' compared the music favorably with that of other [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] composers [[Samuel Barber]], [[William Walton]], and [[William Schuman]].&lt;ref name="Gramophone"&gt;{{cite web |last=Imperato |first=Albert |title=My Weekend With Bernie: Getting beyond Herrmann's famed film scores |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=July 7, 2011 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/blog/new-york-insider/my-weekend-with-bernie |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Initial critical response to the symphony was favorable, though the work has fallen into relative obscurity since its premiere.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  In 2011, Brian Gittis of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' called the work "an underappreciated symphony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gittis |first=Brian |title=Who is Bernard Herrmann? |work=[[The Paris Review]] |date= June 23, 2011|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/06/23/who-is-bernard-herrmann/ |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'''s Albert Imperato also argued for a reassessment of the piece, calling it "more than a curiosity."&lt;ref name="Gramophone" /&gt;  Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith further commented: {{quote|After the innovations of ''[[Citizen Kane|Kane]]'' and ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|All That Money Can Buy]]'' and the orchestral originality of ''Moby Dick'', Herrmann's Symphony seems in some ways a step back, a retreat to concert [[Neoromanticism (music)|Neo-Romanticism]]. [...] Although Herrmann apparently enjoyed the process of its composition, the Symphony illustrates Herrmann's uneasiness working in a rigidly formal structure. It also suffers from the fragmentation that characterizes most of Herrmann's output, a quality ideal for radio and film but not for the concert hall. Yet the Symphony was an impressive achievement for the thirty-year-old Herrmann: a mature, brilliantly orchestrated work whose power increases on subsequent listenings. Its traditional idiom makes it the most accessible of Herrmann's concert works and the most likely candidate for rediscovery (especially in its 1973 revised form).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;}}

__NOTOC__
'''''The Golden Stairs''''' is one of the best-known paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  It was begun in 1876 and exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), pp. 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood (1997), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many of Burne-Jones's works, ''The Golden Stairs'' is not based on a literary source. It has been called [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; as it has no recognisable narrative, but rather sets a mood.  It is a harmony of color in the tradition of the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] works of the 1860s and 1870s, as a group of young women carrying musical instruments descend a spiraling staircase, dressed in classically inspired robes in tones of white, shading to gold and silver.&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Golden Stairs| work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/burne-jones-the-golden-stairs.html | accessdate =31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildman247"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[F. G. Stephens]] wrote in ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' that the musicians "troop past like spirits in an enchanted dream ... whither they go, who they are, there is nothing to tell".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Golden Stairs'' was one of many paintings Burne-Jones sketched out in 1872 following a trip to Italy.  He began work on the canvas in 1876 and finished it in great haste in April 1880, just days before the Grosvenor Gallery exhibition was to open.  Stephens found in the painting echoes of the work of [[Piero della Francesca]], whose frescoes Burne-Jones had seen and copied in 1871.&lt;ref name="Wildman247" /&gt; The figures of the musicians were drawn from professional models, but the heads are young women of Burne-Jones's circle.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt; Some identifications have been made as follows.

His daughter Margaret is fourth from top, holding a trumpet.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 102 (caption to colour plate VI)&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Gellibrand, known by the stage name Edith Chester, is seventh from top, seen stooping.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus (1975), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[May Morris]], daughter of [[William Morris]], is ninth from top, holding a violin. Frances Graham, later known as Lady Horner, daughter of [[William Graham (Glasgow MP)|William Graham]], is bottom left, holding cymbals.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102/&gt; Standing behind her on the stairs is [[Mary Gladstone]], daughter of [[William Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Laura Tennant, later known as [[Laura Lyttelton]], and Mary Stuart-Wortley, later [[Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]].&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

The painting was purchased by [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|Cyril Flower]] (1843–1907), later Lord Battersea, a politician and art patron, and was bequeathed by him to the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]], where it remains.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

'''''The Lace Maker''''' (1662) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Caspar Netscher]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the [[Wallace Collection]].

The woman is sitting working over a [[lace pillow]] on [[bobbin lace]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1913, who wrote; "48. THE LACE MAKER. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 21. Full length. A young girl, simply dressed, sits in profile to the right. She is working with both hands at a bobbin-lace cushion held on her lap. She wears a green skirt, a bright red bodice with the white under-garment showing at the neck and the elbows, and a light cap embroidered in black. Behind her on the floor in the left foreground lie her shoes ; beyond them, in the corner, stands a broom. At the back is a sunlit wall, on which to the right an unframed landscape print is loosely pinned with two nails. 
Signed "C. Netscher," on the margin of the print, and dated 166-

'''''The Magdalen Reading''''' is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century [[Panel painting|oil-on-panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The panel, originally [[oak]], was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the [[National Gallery]], London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky pp.&amp;nbsp;258–9 (writing before the painting had been cleaned of its overpaint): "Soon after the completion of the 'Descent from the Cross,' that is to say, in 1436–1437, Roger would seem to have produced two works in which the youthful feminine types of the Escorial picture, still vaguely Flémallesque, appear refined to greater spirituality: a major composition, apparently a ''Virgo inter Virgines,'' of which only a fragment, the 'Magdalen Reading' in the National Gallery at London, survives; and the beautiful "Madonna Duran" or "Madonna in Red" in the Prado".&lt;/ref&gt; She is identifiable as the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalen]] from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the [[Mary of Bethany#Catholic identification with Mary Magdalene|Magdalen was conflated]] with both [[Mary of Bethany]] who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–48}} is also relevant.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unnamed "sinner" of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}. [[Iconography]] of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.

The background of the painting had been [[overpainting|overpainted]] with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, which shows the head of [[Saint Joseph]], while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], is thought to be from the same larger work.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rogier-van-der-weyden-the-magdalen-reading The Magdalen Reading]". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The original altarpiece was a ''[[sacra conversazione]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A 'sacred conversation' is an informal depiction of the Virgin and Child among a group of saints.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MGulb"&gt;"[http://www.museu.gulbenkian.pt/obra.asp?num=79ab&amp;nuc=a9&amp;lang=en Bust of St Catherine ?; Bust of 'St Joseph'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001230613/http://www.museu.gulbenkian.pt/obra.asp?num=79ab&amp;nuc=a9&amp;lang=en |date=2009-10-01 }}. Museu Gulbenkian, 19 April 2009. Retrieved 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; known only through a drawing, ''[[Virgin and Child with Saints (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child with Saints]]'', in Stockholm's [[Nationalmuseum]], which followed a partial copy of the painting that probably dated from the late 16th century. The drawing shows that ''The Magdalen'' occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of ''The Magdalen'', which measures {{convert|62.2|x|54.4|cm|abbr=on}}.

Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. ''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the [[National Gallery]], London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] as "one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works."&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:M Reading Detail2.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the face and veil of Mary Magdalene painted in pure whites. The eyebrows and eyelids have been plucked in accordance with conventional ideals of beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Plucked-Shaved-Braided-Renaissance-Practices/dp/193006408X Turudich] (2004), 198&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Mary Magdalene]] as depicted in early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painting]] is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on [[Mary of Bethany]], who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and "listened to His Word", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister [[Martha]] who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve.&lt;ref name="jj54"&gt;Jones (2011), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a ''chemise'' of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript "looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible" and is "clearly a devotional text".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395–396, 398; quotes 396, 398.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.&lt;ref name="B58"&gt;Belloli (2001), 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;  She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden [[sideboard]]. By her feet is her usual [[emblem|attribute]] of an [[alabaster]] jar; in the [[Gospel]]s she brought spices to the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998),398; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:1}}. Another passage, taken in the [[Middle Ages]] to refer to the Magdalene, {{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}} is the source of the [[alabaster]] jar.&lt;/ref&gt; The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an [[Archery|archer]] atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.&lt;ref name="P54"&gt;Potterton (1977), 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail showing the prayer book, likely a [[book of hours]], decorated with white cloth and gold clasps.]]
Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master [[Robert Campin]] or his workshop.&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;  It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of [[Saint Barbara]] in Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]'',&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Clark (1960), 45&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Virgin in an ''[[Annunciation]]'' attributed to Campin in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 400; the ''[[Merode Altarpiece]]'' is another version of this composition, though the Virgin's figure there is less similar.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white.&lt;ref&gt;Salih (2002), 130&lt;/ref&gt; Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue [[sash]], while the gold [[brocade]] of her [[Petticoat|underskirt]] is adorned by a jewelled hem.&lt;ref name="B58" /&gt; Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a "[[Prostitution|fallen woman]]" is hinted at by the [[Nap (textile)|nap]] in the [[fur]] lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil.  Darwent wrote, "Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't."&lt;ref name="Darw"&gt;Darwent, Charles. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/rogier-van-der-weyden-master-of-passions-museum-leuven-belgium-1793708.html Rogier van der Weyden: Master of Passions, Museum Leuven, Belgium]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 27 September 2009. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as [[Hans Memling|Memling]] and [[Quentin Matsys|Matsys]] often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she "is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in ''The Magdalen Reading'' by Rogier van der Weyden".&lt;ref&gt;Crispin (2008), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the jar and row of nails on the timber floor at the lower right corner of the panel. Note the attention paid to the gilded clasp and fall of the shadow.]]

The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as "far exceed[ing]" [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]. Her lips are painted with a shades of [[vermilion]], white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of [[impasto]], grid and dots of varying colour and size.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"&gt;Campbell (1998), 402&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt; The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal [[Rosary#Rosary beads|rosary beads]] have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt;

Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as "small miracles of painting", and says that "the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 396 and 402&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect".&lt;ref name="Darw" /&gt; A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases.&lt;ref&gt;These objects are often cut off in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]], possibly a [[reliquary]]. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.&lt;ref name="JW35"&gt;Ward (1971), 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altarpiece fragment==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - St Joseph - WGA25722.jpg|thumb|220px|''Head of Saint Joseph'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. This panel is thought to show [[Saint Joseph]], whose body is visible to his upper arm in ''The Magdalen Reading''.]]

''Virgin and Child with Saints'',&lt;ref name="C49"&gt;Campbell (2004), 49&lt;/ref&gt; a drawing in Stockholm's [[Nationalmuseum]], is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden,&lt;ref name="C398-400"&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400&lt;/ref&gt; who possibly may have been the [[Master of the Drapery Studies|Master of the Coburger Rundblätter]]. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with [[mitre]] and [[crosier]] making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint [[John the Baptist]]; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as [[John the Evangelist]]. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt; This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden (1399of1400-1464) - Buste van Ste. Catharina - Lissabon Museu Calouste Gulbenkian 21-10-2010 13-11-07.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Head of a Female Saint (Saint Catherine?)'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. A possible representation of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop.]]

At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, 398&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to damage, although ''The Magdalen'' fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings".&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"/&gt; From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1&amp;nbsp;m high by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period.&lt;ref name="C398-400"/&gt; The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of Léo Lardus in [[Suresnes]], France.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt; Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear [[rosary]] beads in one hand&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's beads closely resemble those in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside ''The Magdalen Reading''. See Jones, 46, 54&lt;/ref&gt; and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]] shows the head of a figure believed to be the [[Saint Joseph]]; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

[[File:The Magdalen Reading uncleaned.jpg|thumb|260px|Cropped 1930s black and white photograph of the panel before it was cleaned of the overpaint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Davies (museum director)|Davies, Martin]] (1937), 140, 142–145&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the overpainting and the breaking up of the altarpiece are unknown.]]

There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at [[Suresnes]]. The figure may represent [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.&lt;ref name="Campell49"&gt;Campell (2009), 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  Some art historians, including [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] and John Ward,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since.&lt;/ref&gt; have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is [[chamfer]]ed. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3&amp;nbsp;cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures {{convert|18.6|x|21.7|cm|abbr=on}}, the Saint Joseph {{convert|18.2|x|21|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "W32"&gt;Ward (1971), 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is "obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the ''Magdalen''",&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"/&gt; it "seems likely" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that "about half way up the right edge of this fragment ["Catherine"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist".&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.&lt;!-- Campbell says J the Baptist &amp; Ward says J the Evangelist? Is this a mistake? --&gt;&lt;ref name = "W32"/&gt;

The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward—which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints—is widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the ''[[recto and verso|verso]]'' shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a [[Brussels]] workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Weyden, Rogier van der - Descent from the Cross - Detail women (left).jpg|260px|thumb|Detail from ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany,&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described as "This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair".{{Bibleref2|John|11:1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified by the time of [[Pope Gregory I]] as the repentant prostitute of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara (1994), 24&lt;/ref&gt; She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by [[Tintoretto]] and [[Titian]] which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a [[Gaze|male gaze]]), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212/&gt; Writing in "The Crying Face", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a "pictorial formula for crying".&lt;ref&gt;Barasch (1987), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campin Annunciation triptych.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Mérode Altarpiece|Annunciation]]'', attributed to Robert Campin, [[Brussels]], c. 1427–1432, where the figure of the Virgin is close to van der Weyden's London Magdalen.]]

By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a [[psalter]] or [[book of hours]] in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2007), 10–12, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.&lt;ref&gt;Jagodzinski (1999), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212&gt;Badir (2007), 212&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in [[Sainte-Baume]] and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2009), 174&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and "borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth".&lt;ref&gt;Maisch (1998), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1996), 170&lt;/ref&gt; She signified the "sacrament of anointing ([[Chrism]] and [[Anointing|Unction]])" by pouring precious [[spikenard]] on Christ's feet at his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos-Cappadona (2005), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and provenance==

The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/rogier-van-der-weyden Rogier van der Weyden]". [[National Gallery]], London. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by [[Robert Campin]].&lt;ref name="JW35"/&gt; He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna and Child with Saints Master of the Koberger.JPG|thumb|280px|The Stockholm drawing, attributed to the Master of the Coburger Rundblätter, likely shows the portion of the altarpiece to the left of the Magdalen. The kneeling figure to the far right is probably Saint [[John the Evangelist]], some of whose red drapery can be seen in the London fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's position on the lower right hand corner (out of view) is guessed at by Ward from van der Weyden's positioning of similar figures in other works.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Because van der Weyden, like most of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|early Netherlandish painters]], was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 7, 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.

''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in [[Haarlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell; Stock (2009), 441&lt;/ref&gt; when the work was already cut down.&lt;ref name="Darw"/&gt; The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell (2004), 50&lt;/ref&gt; After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt; in Paris, whose "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the [[National Gallery]], London by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] in 1860; an acquisition that also included two [[Robert Campin]] portraits and panels by [[Simon Marmion]] (1425–1489).&lt;ref name ="R203"&gt;Borchert (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery.&lt;ref name ="R203"/&gt; Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, with photo on 395&lt;/ref&gt;  In general the "painted surface is in very good condition", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.&lt;ref name="C394"&gt;Campbell (1998), 394&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magdalen Reading'' was transferred from its original oak to a [[mahogany]] panel (West Indian [[swietenia]])&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395&lt;/ref&gt; by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was "Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="C394"/&gt; Artificial [[ultramarine]]-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997), 85&lt;/ref&gt; The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bjurström (1985), 166&lt;/ref&gt; It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="C49" /&gt;

'''The Oxburgh [[chalice (cup)|Chalice]]''' is preserved by the church authorities in the parish of Templeport in [[County Cavan]], Ireland. It bears the date 1665 and is inscribed in [[Latin]] with the following inscription (in translation): ''Pray for the soul of Heward Oxburgh and Clare Oxburgh alias Coghlan who had this made in 1665.''

== History ==
Heward Oxburgh was High Sheriff of [[Offaly]] (Kings  County) and represented the county in the [[Patriot Parliament]] summoned by [[James II of England|King James II]] in 1689. The Oxburghs were strong supporters of James II and several officers of the family fought at [[Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]]. Colonel Heward Oxburgh was killed at the [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July 1691. After the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] the Oxburgh estates were confiscated. Clare Oxburgh made a claim on her late husband’s property and this helps to establish the donors of the chalice. She belonged to the Coghlan family who also had estates in Offaly and whose lands were confiscated by [[William III of England|William of Orange]].

A synod of the Irish church was held in Baunbuidhe ([[Bawnboy]]) in the parish of [[Templeport]] at [[Pentecost]] 1669, four years after the Oxburgh Chalice was made.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''De Praesulibus Hiberniae'', Vol. I, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition says that the chalice had been in the possession of a friar named O’Coghlan who attended the synod as a representative of a northern [[Franciscan]] friary and that this is how the chalice came to Bawnboy.

The base of the chalice shows Christ crucified, with a ladder on either side of the cross. There are figures of two animals and a bird that resembles a pelican with its young on its back, being fed with the mother’s flesh and blood, a symbol for the Eucharist.

The chalice is only used on rare occasions.

'''''Ut pictura poesis''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase literally meaning "as is [[painting]] so is [[poetry]]". The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, "bonus dormitat Homerus", or "[[Homeric nod|even Homer nods]]" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse):
:Poetry resembles painting. Some works will captivate you when you stand very close to them and others if you are at a greater distance. This one prefers a darker vantage point, that one wants to be seen in the light since it feels no terror before the penetrating judgment of the critic. This pleases only once, that will give pleasure even if we go back to it ten times over. (Quoting from English translation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Horace|last=Golden|first=Leon|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-5540-3|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Gregson|location=Oxford, UK|pages=400|chapter=Reception of Horace's Ars Poetica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, "imaginative texts") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting.

Some centuries before [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides of Keos]]( c. 556 – 468 BC) had stated, "Poema pictura loquens, pictura poema silens," which translates into, "Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/utpict.html.|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. [[Plato]], through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding so disregarded the whole concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up of which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, painting took precedence because sight was higher ranking to people than hearing was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmt.uchicago.edu/gloassary/2004/utpicturapoesis.htm|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] opens his ''[[Laocoön|Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry]]'' (1766){{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} by observing that "the first who compared painting with poetry &amp;#91;[[Simonides of Ceos]]&amp;#93; was a man of fine feeling,"&lt;ref&gt;Simonides, who wrote "poema pictura locguens, pictura poema silens" (poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent [mute] poetry) was quoted by [[Plutarch]], ''De gloria Atheniensium'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0234%3Astephpage%3D346f 3.346f].&lt;/ref&gt; though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated "as two equitable and friendly neighbors."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[W. J. T. Mitchell]] trenchantly observed that "We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a [[metaphor]], while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth."&lt;ref&gt;Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (University of Chicago Press, 1986) page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Pope ==
18th-century British poet [[Alexander Pope]] was partial to ''ut pictura poesis.'' He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and "it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert W.|date=1983-1984|title=Alexander Pope and Ut Pictura Poesis|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSE/article/view/396/365|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=9|pages=61–75|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is note of Pope finding himself "in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"/&gt; ''Ut pictura poesis'' surfaces in regards to Pope's [[The Rape of the Lock|"Rape of the Lock"]] through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay "'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's "Rape of the Lock", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda’s character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: "Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body," and

&lt;blockquote&gt;The belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both her body and her allure in the reader's eye. (Ferguson)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Rebecca|date=1992|title=Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix’d as those’: objectification and seeing in  Pope’s "Rape of the Lock"|url=|journal=Critical Survey|volume=4|pages=14–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.

The '''Vienna School of Art History''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte}}) was the development of fundamental [[art history|art-historical]] methods at the [[University of Vienna]]. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.

A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School  combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.

The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by [[Otto Benesch]] in 1920 and by [[Julius von Schlosser]] in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.

== History ==

===Pragmatic art history===

[[Rudolf Eitelberger]] is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the [[Vormärz]], and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.

The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was [[Moritz Thausing]], who in 1879 became the second ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from [[aesthetics]].

===Formalist art history===

Thausing's students [[Franz Wickhoff]] (Professor 1891) and [[Alois Riegl]] (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of [[late antiquity]], which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of [[positivism]], focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.

===Idealist art history===

After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by [[Max Dvořák]], who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of [[Mannerism]]. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed "''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte''" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in [[Hans Tietze]] and [[Otto Benesch]].

===Structuralist art history===

Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 [[Julius von Schlosser]] was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Karl Vossler]], a Munich-based professor of the [[Romance languages]], under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the "''Stilgeschichte''" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the "''Sprachgeschichte''" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides [[Ernst Gombrich]], were [[Hans Sedlmayr]] and [[Otto Pächt]], who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."

===Ideological art history===

[[Josef Strzygowski]], who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of "''Planforschung''," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.

===Synthesis===

The era of [[Nazism]] signified a turning point for the Vienna School.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Aurenhammer, "Zäsur oder Kontinuität? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im Ständestaat und im Nationalsozialismus." In ''Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven'' (''Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte'', 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. [[Hans Sedlmayr]], a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, [[Karl Maria Swoboda]] assumed leadership of the ''Insitut'', where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two ''Ordinarius'' positions were once more created, and were filled by [[Otto Pächt]] (a student of Schlosser) and [[Otto Demus]] (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a "''Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte''" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of [[Fritz Novotny]]. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

''Walking to Church'' sold for $3.2 million (including a buyer's premium) at the auctioneers [[Sotheby's]] in New York in December 2013.&lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{Cite web |work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/04/norman-rockwell-painting-sells-record-auction|title=Norman Rockwell painting bought for record $46m price at Sotheby's auction|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other Rockwell paintings that had been loaned to the Norman Rockwell Museum were sold alongside ''Walking to Church''; ''[[Saying Grace (Rockwell)|Saying Grace]]'' and ''The Gossips''.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The three paintings, along with four other art works by Rockwell, were sold by the descendants of Kenneth J. Stuart, the [[art director]] of ''The Saturday Evening Post''. The sale of the art works was initiated after the conclusion of a legal disagreement between Stuart's sons.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; A long term colleague of Rockwell's, Stuart had been given the paintings by Rockwell as a gift.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; ''Walking to Church'' had hung in the bedroom of Stuart's wife, Katherine. Stuart's sons could no longer afford the insurance and upkeep of the paintings by the time of their 2013 sale.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Upon Stuart's death in 1993 his estate was divided equally between his three sons, Ken Jr., William and Jonathan.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The oldest brother, Ken Jr., was subsequently sued by William and Jonathan, who claimed that he had forced their father to sign papers so could gain control of his fortune.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; They additionally claimed that Ken Jr. had used the assets of his father's estate for his own expenses.

The director of the Norman Rockwell Museum, Laurie Norton Moffatt, has expressed her hope that the paintings will eventually be reunited with the museum. Moffatt said of the paintings that "We cared for them like children&amp;nbsp;... We hope they come back some day. We believe that's where they belong."&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; Moffatt said that the loss of the paintings left an "irreplaceable hole in the museum's collection."&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt;

'''Walter Hood Fitch''' (28 February 1817 &amp;ndash; 1892) was a [[botanical illustrator]], born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], who executed some 10,000 drawings for various publications.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; His work in colour [[lithograph]], including 2700 illustrations for ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]'', produced up to 200 plates per year.&lt;ref name="Kew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/heritage/people/fitch.html|title=Walter Hood Fitch (1817-1892)|work=Kew, History &amp; Heritage|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2009-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129190957/http://www.kew.org/heritage/people/fitch.html|archivedate=2009-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/fitch.walter.html|title=Fitch, Walter Hood (1817 - 1892)|work=Collectors &amp; Illustrators|publisher=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fitch was involved in fabric printing from the age of 17 and took to botanical art after meeting [[William Jackson Hooker]], [[Regius Professor]] of Botany, a competent botanical illustrator, and the editor of ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''. Fitch's first lithograph of ''Mimulus roseus''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the Botanical Magazine in 1834, and he soon became its sole artist. In 1841 W.J. Hooker became director of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and Fitch moved to [[London]]. After 1841 Fitch was the sole artist for all official and unofficial publications issued by Kew; his work was paid for by Hooker personally. It was not unusual for him to work on several different publications simultaneously; he could draw directly onto the [[lithography|lithographic stone]] to save time. These [[chromolithograph]]s were based on botanical illustrations provided by Hooker and others, and produced some of his most spectacular results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html|title=Plants and Gardens portrayed|work=LuEsther T. Mertz Library|publisher=The New York Botanical Garden|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitch's important works are his illustrations for William Hooker's ''A century of orchidaceous plants''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1849), and for [[James Bateman]]'s ''A Monograph of Odontoglossum''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1864–74). He also created around 500 plates for Hooker's ''Icones Plantarum'' (1836–76) and four lithographic plates for the monograph ''Victoria Regia''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work received critical acclaim in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', "they are accurate, and they are beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allibone|first=Samuel Austin |author-link=Samuel Austin Allibone|title=A critical dictionary of English literature and British and American authors|publisher=George W.

[[File:Victoria Regia. (Opening flower) (1851).jpeg|thumb|Plate 2, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', of ''Victoria Regia'', 1851]]
Other works were for [[George Bentham]]'s ''Handbook of the British Flora''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1858, later editions edited by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]).
When J. D, Hooker returned from his travels in [[India]], Fitch prepared lithographs from Hooker's sketches for his ''Rhododendrons of Sikkim Himalaya''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1849–51) and, from the drawings of Indian artists, for his ''Illustrations of Himalayan Plants''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1855). He also produced the illustrations presented in the younger Hooker's ''[[Flora Antarctica|The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage]]'', consisting of three volumes covering the flora of the Antarctic, New Zealand, and Tasmania collected on the [[Ross expedition]] of 1839 to 1843.&lt;ref name="ANH"/&gt;

A dispute over pay with J. D. Hooker ended Fitch's service to both the ''Botanical Magazine'' and Kew in 1877. He was much sought after and remained active as a botanical artist until 1888. Works during this period included [[Henry John Elwes]]'s ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium''&lt;ref&gt;

 | url =https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/536#}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  (1877–80). His renown as a botanical illustrator was such that his obituary in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated "... his reputation was so high and so world-wide that it is unnecessary to say much on this point.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v45/n1161/abs/045302a0.html News.] ''Nature'' '''45''', 302-302 (28 January 1892)&lt;/ref&gt;

His nephew, [[John Nugent Fitch]] (1840&amp;ndash;1927), also produced illustrations for ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''.
