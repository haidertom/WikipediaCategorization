'''''A Negress''''' ({{lang-pl|[[Murzyn|Murzynka]]}}) is an 1884 realistic portrait study [[oil painting]] on canvas by the Polish artist [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]. During [[World War II]], the painting was stolen; it was recovered in 2012.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Negress|url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/en/portfolio/a-negress/|publisher=Lost Museum|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture was painted in oil technique in 1884 in [[Paris]]. It is a portrait of a black woman located on a light background. She is shown from waist up, dressed in a white robe, but is part naked, exposing a breast. She wears a gold necklace, and a red head scarf. This type of painting of an exotic person was a  popular topic in the late nineteenth century. The canvas is signed in the upper right corner with the painter's family name and date of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negress Back in the National Museum|url=http://dzieje.pl/kultura-i-sztuka/odnaleziony-obraz-murzynka-wraca-do-muzeum-narodowego|publisher=Dzieje.pl|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The painting originally belonged to the collector Dominik Witke-Jeżewski, who deposited the canvas at the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]] in 1933. In 1939, the painting was purchased by the Museum for 700 [[złoty]]s. During World War II, the painting was stolen in unknown circumstances, and since 1945 was sought by the Poles. In 2011, the painting appeared at an auction in Germany. It was recovered thanks to the effort of the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] and the support of the Kronenberg Foundation of Citi Handlowy Bank. Since 2012 the picture is once more displayed at the Warsaw National Museum.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

'''Ian Matthias Bavitz''' (born June 5, 1976), better known by his stage name '''Aesop Rock''', is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist and producer residing in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He was at the forefront of the new wave of [[underground hip hop|underground]] and [[alternative hip hop]] acts that emerged during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was signed to [[El-P]]'s [[Definitive Jux]] label until it went on hiatus in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37778-definitive-jux-goes-on-hiatus/|title=Definitive Jux Goes "On Hiatus"|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=February 3, 2010|website=pitchfork.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; betterPropaganda ranked him at number 19 at the ''Top 100 Artists of the Decade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=990|title=Top 100 Artists of the Decade|last=Taylor-Parker|first=Phillip|date=|work=|publisher=''betterPropaganda''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106084109/http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=990|archive-date=January 6, 2010|via=|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the groups [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]], [[Hail Mary Mallon]] (with [[Rob Sonic]] &amp; DJ Big Wiz), [[The Uncluded]] (with [[Kimya Dawson]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Two of Every Animal (with [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhymesayers.com/hailmarymallon|title=Hail Mary Mallon|last=|first=|date=|website=rhymesayers.com|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his name, he said: "I acquired the name Aesop from a movie I had acted in with some friends. It was my character's name and it sort of stuck. The rock part came later just from throwing it in rhymes."&lt;ref name="mvremix1"&gt;[http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/aesoprock.shtml Aesop Rock Interview with MVRemix Urban | US and Canadian Underground Hip Hop and Soul&amp;nbsp;– exclusive interviews, reviews, articles].

==Early life and education==

===Early and personal life===
Bavitz was born at Syosset Hospital in [[Syosset, New York]] and raised in [[Northport, New York|Northport]], [[Long Island]], New York to his father Paul and mother Jameija.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Aesop Rock&amp;nbsp;– One of Four (Thank You) | work = | publisher= SongMeanings.com| url = http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858559450/ | accessdate = December 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian has two brothers: Christopher T. Bavitz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10055/Bavitz|title=Christopher T. Bavitz {{!}} Harvard Law School|last=School|first=Harvard Law|website=hls.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1973), a clinical professor at [[Harvard Law School]] and director of Cyberlaw Clinic at the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]], and Graham J. Bavitz (born 1978). Ian, along with his siblings, was raised [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] but later on in his life became agnostic.&lt;ref name="MVRemix"&gt;{{cite news | last =Doe| first =John| title = Aesop Rock: Laundry Days | work =Unknown | publisher= MVRemix.com| url = http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/aesop_rock_06.shtml | accessdate = February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bavitz attended [[Northport High School]] in 1990 and graduated in 1994. He married Allyson Baker, guitarist and vocalist of rock band [[Dirty Ghosts]] in 2005. They resided in San Francisco but have since divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stickymagazine.com/features/interviews/736-dirty-ghosts |title=Talking Dirty: An Interview with Allyson Baker of Dirty Ghosts |author=Chad Hutchings |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114185010/http://stickymagazine.com/features/interviews/736-dirty-ghosts |archivedate=November 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has [[tattoos]] on each forearm. His left arm reads "Must Not Sleep..." and the right says "...Must Warn Others." These are inspired by childhood antics where he and his friends would act as robots arms outstretched quoting the line which has its origins in the 1956 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''. Aesop Rock has used these quotes as lyrics in the chorus of his song "Commencement at the Obedience Academy": "Must not sleep; must warn others / Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers." He also used them in his song "Antisocial," in the line "Must not sleep; must warn others / I'll tourniquet your turbulence then trample on your stutters."

===1994–1998: College===
After graduating from high school, Bavitz attended [[Boston University]] in [[Massachusetts]] where he studied [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=firsttime&gt;{{cite web|date=May 27, 2015|title=My First Time: Aesop Rock Remembers 1996|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/05/my-first-time-aesop-rock-remembers-1996/|publisher=Pigeons &amp; Planes|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|bachelor's]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110117211713/http://www-test.bu.edu/alumni/informed/famous/arts/ Retrieved February 24, 2011]. Test.bu.edu. Retrieved on November 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He met his future collaborator, [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]], in 1994 during the latter's only year at the school. After hearing Aesop Rock freestyle, Blockhead decided to forgo his own dreams of rapping in favor of focusing on production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/blockhead/id5609495|title=iTunes - Music - Blockhead|work=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockhead was involved with a crew in New York called The Overground that included [[Dub-L]].&lt;ref name="Splendid Zine Interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Walt |title=Love / Hate: Aesop Rock |work=Online Magazine |publisher=Splendid |url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/aesop/ |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213203756/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/aesop/ |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early adulthood, Aesop Rock held various odd jobs including positions answering phones for clothing catalogs, packaging artwork in [[art gallery]] storerooms and working for one-hour [[Photographic processing|photo developers]].&lt;ref name=firsttime /&gt;

==Musical career==

===1985–2001: New York City underground music scene===
As a youth, Bavitz and his family would usually [[Commuting|commute]] to New York City. This had a great impact on him and the way he viewed the [[hip hop culture]]. Bavitz began rapping in the early 1990s. He cites [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Boogie Down Productions|BDP]], [[KMD]], and [[Run DMC]] as early influences.&lt;ref name="mvremix1"/&gt; Bavitz also listened to rock acts such as [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Fugazi]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]; he was introduced to these groups by his older brother Chris.&lt;ref name="The Metabunker"&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Sie|ze|hide=y}} the Moment!

He then eventually acquired a [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Sie|ze|hide=y}} the Moment! Interview |url=http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=295 |publisher=The Metabunker |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131162331/http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=295 |archivedate=January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, ''[[Music for Earthworms]]'' (1997), a full-length featuring [[underground hip hop|underground]] artist [[Percee P]] on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video to "Abandon All Hope", which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies,&lt;ref name="The Metabunker"/&gt; largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ootbot.com/archives/aesoprock/wormyhole/ AesopRock.com]. Retrieved on January 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the money he made from his previous release, he then released his ''[[Appleseed (EP)|Appleseed]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1999 which received critical acclaim in the underground hip-hop circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} His early records were mostly produced by a long-time friend [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]], and underground producer [[Dub-L]].

After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the [[Mush (record label)|Mush]] label and obtained his first [[record deal]] in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, ''[[Float (Aesop Rock album)|Float]]'' (2000), with guest appearances from [[Vast Aire]], [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]], and [[Dose One]]. Production was split between [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography [[Contemporary art gallery|gallery]].&lt;ref name="AesopRockInterview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplunk |first=Sumo |title=AES Interview |work=U.K. Hip-Hop |publisher=UKHH |url=http://www.mushrecords.com/articles/AesopRockUKHipHopProfile1.htm |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001 tragedy struck when Bavitz had a [[nervous breakdown]]. The song "One of Four" on his ''Daylight'' EP documents his struggles.&lt;ref name="mrcomplex"&gt;{{cite news | last =Werde| first =Bill| title = Mr. Complex | work =[[Urb Magazine|URB]] | publisher= URB| url = http://www.mushrecords.com/articles/AesopRockUrbMrComplex.html | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–2004: ''Labor Days'', ''Daylight'' EP, ''Bazooka Tooth''===
Shortly after releasing ''Float'', Aesop Rock signed to [[Manhattan]]-based label [[Definitive Jux]] (commonly shortened to Def Jux), where he released ''[[Labor Days]]'' (2001), an album dedicated to the discussion of labor in American society and the concept of [[wage slavery|"wage slaves"]]. This album was most well known for its single "Daylight".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Because of its popularity, ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' was re-released in 2002 as a seven-track EP, including an "alternative" new version of the song "Night Light", whose paraphrased lyrics simultaneously refer back to, and stand in stark opposition to, the original's. The song "Labor" (from ''Labor Days'') was featured in ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]''; it also was the first album in his catalog to break through the ''Billboard'' charts, peaking at number 15 at the [[Billboard Top Independent Albums#Top Independent Albums|United States Independent Charts]].
[[Image:Aesop Rock live.jpg|220px|thumb|Aesop Rock performing live]]

''Labor Days'' was followed by ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]'' in 2003. For the first time, production was mostly handled by Rock himself, with three tracks from longtime collaborator [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and one from close friend and Definitive Jux label CEO El-P. Guest appearances include [[Party Fun Action Committee]], El-P, and [[Mr. Lif]] (all Definitive Jux labelmates) and [[Camp Lo]]. With this release Aesop hit a higher level of recognition, releasing "No Jumper Cables" as a single and music video, then another single, "Freeze", shortly after. A remix of "No Jumper Cables" was featured on ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', furthering Aesop's recognition. In 2004, he released ''[[Build Your Own Bazooka Tooth]]'' and created a contest in which you had to create a remix of an Aesop Rock song using the cappellas and instrumentals.

===2005–2007: ''Fast Cars'' EP, ''None Shall Pass'', Nike+iPod ===
In February 2005, Aesop Rock released a new EP, ''[[Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives]]''. The first pressing of the EP included an 88-page booklet with lyrics from every release from ''Float'' until this EP (the lyric booklet is titled ''The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow''); later pressings of the album come without the booklet, but with an additional bonus track, "Facemelter". In addition, a limited number of albums were available direct from Def Jux with Aesop Rock's [[graffiti]] tag on them. In response to demands from his fans, Rock did less production on the EP: three songs are produced by Blockhead, three produced by Aesop, and one by [[Rob Sonic]]. During this time he was asked to join [[The Weathermen (hip-hop group)|The Weathermen]] to replace [[Vast Aire]].

Aesop Rock was commissioned to create a 45-minute instrumental track for the [[Nike+iPod]] running system, entitled ''All Day''. It was released in February 2007. Distributed via the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] and featuring his wife Allyson Baker on guitar and [[turntablism|scratches]] from DJ Big Wiz, Aesop has described the release as "something that evolved enough that the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as though the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes."&lt;ref name="Podophile"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/ | title = Nike+ Aesop Rock: New "Original Run" Mix This Tuesday | publisher = Podophile.com | date = February 11, 2007 | accessdate = March 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070312162411/http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/| archivedate= March 12, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All Day'' was followed in August of the same year by Bavitz's fifth full-length album, ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' released in 2007. The album also contained original artwork by [[Jeremy Fish]]. About Jeremy Fish, Aesop Rock said: "Man that guy is my hero. We have a friend in common who hit me up a while back saying that this guy Jeremy Fish had an opportunity to pitch a cartoon to Disney and wanted me to be involved in the music side. I flipped out cuz I was also a fan of his, and owned some of his work." Aesop Rock also teamed up with Jeremy Fish again in a project called Ghosts of the Barbary Coast. Aesop Rock made a song called "Tomorrow Morning", to go along with a slideshow of drawings that Jeremy Fish drew. This was displayed in San Francisco, but was also made available for download online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fecalface.com/SF/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&amp;Itemid=100 Aesop Rock Interview]. Fecalface.com.

===2007–2011: Hiatus===
In February 2010, El-P announced that the label would be put "on hiatus," aside from selling its catalog and merchandise. During this time Bavitz was absent in terms of making any new albums or EPs, albeit being featured on other artist records and producing.

===2008–2013: Rhymesayers, HMM, Kimya Dawson, ''Skelethon''===
In 2009, Bavitz produced [[Felt (hip hop)|Felt's]] third album, ''[[Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez]]''.

April 20, 2011: it was announced that [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] would release [[Hail Mary Mallon]]'s debut album ''Are You Going To Eat That?''. A music video for their first single off the album ''Smock'' was announced that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

January 17, 2012: it was reported that Aesop Rock finished recording his upcoming solo album ''[[Skelethon]]'', and it was scheduled to be released July 10, 2012 through Rhymesayers Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesop Rock Preps New LP|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/45139-aesop-rock-preps-new-lp-skelethon/|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate= January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced he will be performing on the first day of Coachella 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://showscoop.com/32506-Aesop-Rock |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216184459/http://showscoop.com/32506-Aesop-Rock |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |title=Aesop Rock Tour |publisher=showscoop |accessdate=February 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Aesop Rock released a music video for the song "Rings" and announced his seventh studio album ''The Impossible Kid'', which was released on April 29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matera|first1=C.

In 2017, Aesop Rock scored his first film soundtrack for [[Bushwick (film)|Bushwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aesop-rock-bushwick-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|title=Aesop Rock: Bushwick (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative album with electronic musician [[Tobacco (musician)|Tobacco]] entitled ''Malibu Ken'' is scheduled to be released in January 2019.

==Lyrics==
Bavitz's lyrics are generally seen as being both complex and abstract while others dismiss them as [[verbosity|verbose]]. His frequent use of [[homonym]]s exacerbates this. Critics state that the use of words can be so detailed that it becomes difficult to determine their originally intended meaning.&lt;ref name="louispattison"&gt;{{cite news | last =Pattison | first =Louis | title = Aesop Rock's well-chosen words paint dense, fascinating pictures | work =[[BBC]] | publisher= BBC | date =August 1, 2007 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/wvxm/ | accessdate = October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics are sometimes inspired by events which have occurred in Bavitz's personal life and are thus naturally prone to subjective interpretation by outsiders.&lt;ref name="kimedward"&gt;{{cite news

Questioned about his lyrical style in an interview, Bavitz responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It’s probably because it’s not the most accessible music in the world. It may pose a slight challenge to the listener beyond your average pop song. I'm no genius by a long shot, but these songs are not nonsensical, that's pretty preposterous. I'd have to be a genius to pull this many nonsensical records over people's eyes. It's not exactly fast food but when people pretend I'm just spewing non-sequiturs and gibberish I can’t help but think they simply haven’t listened and are regurgitating some rumor they’ve heard about me. Even if it's not laid out in perfect sentences—is any rap?—you’d have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything from them in the first place."&lt;ref name="guernicaarticle"&gt;{{cite news |last=DiPalo |first=Joseph |title=Graffiti or Vermeer |work=[[Guernica Magazine|Guernica]] |publisher=Guernica |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205045610/http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2002 on the song "One of Four" (a hidden track on the ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' EP) Aesop Rock explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But I can tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it / so take this how you want but know I mean it."&lt;br /&gt;
— Aesop Rock, "One of Four" ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' EP (2002)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2014, a study by Matt Daniels found that Aesop Rock's vocabulary in his music surpassed 85 other major hip-hop and rap artists, as well as Shakespeare's works and Herman Melville's Moby Dick, being named the largest vocabulary in Hip Hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html|title=Rappers, sorted by the size of their vocabulary|last=Daniels|first=Matt|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated, to-scale view of this study was subsequently done by Mike Pultz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop (Adjusted)|url=http://mikepultz.com/number-of-unique-words-used-within-artists-first-35000-lyrics-adjusted/|publisher=Mike Pultz|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build up his vocabulary, he reads a lot of news and science articles and writes down all the words he finds interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Jon|title=Interview: Aesop Rock|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-aesop-rock/|website=Sound of Boston|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Akaa logo.png|{{largethumb}}|Logo for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture]]
The '''Aga Khan Award for Architecture''' ('''AKAA''') is an [[List of architecture prizes|architectural prize]] established by [[Aga Khan IV]] in 1977. It aims to identify and reward [[architecture|architectural]] concepts that successfully address the needs and aspirations of [[Muslim world|Islamic societies]] in the fields of contemporary [[design]], [[social housing]], [[community development]] and improvement, [[Building restoration|restoration]], [[reuse]] and [[Architectural conservation|area conservation]], as well as [[landscape design]] and [[Environmental science|improvement of the environment]].&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"&gt;"[http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0109/news_1-1.html Aga Khan Award for Architecture]." ''ArchitectureWeek'' 9 Jan. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented in three-year cycles to multiple projects and has a monetary award, with prizes totalling [[United States dollar|US$]] 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;^[http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/aga-khan-award-for-architecture-prize-doubled-to-us-1-million/1001116410/ ''Canadian Architect'', April 26, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely among architectural awards, it recognizes projects, teams, and stakeholders in addition to buildings and people.&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt;

The award is associated with the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] (AKTC), an agency of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN).

==Award process==
The award is aimed at societies in which Muslims have a significant presence.&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt; It is organised on the basis of a three-year cycle and is governed by a steering committee chaired by the Aga Khan IV.&lt;ref name="CanadianArc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/aga-khan-award-for-architecture-announces-master-jury-for-2007/1000060192/|title=Aga Khan Award for Architecture announces Master Jury for 2007 - Canadian Architect|date=12 January 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new committee is constituted each cycle to establish the eligibility criteria for projects, provide thematic direction with reference to current concerns, and to develop plans for the long-term future of the award. The ''Steering Committee'' is responsible for the selection of the ''Master Jury'' appointed for each award cycle, and for activities such as [[seminar]]s and field visits, the [[award ceremony]], publications and exhibitions.

===Chairman's Award===
The ''Chairman's Award'' is given in honour of accomplishments that fall outside the mandate of the Master Jury. It recognises lifetime achievements. It has been presented four times: in 1980 to Egyptian architect and urban planner [[Hassan Fathy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/firstcycle/chairman.html Lifetime Achievements of Hassan Fathy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004014/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/firstcycle/chairman.html |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 to Iraqi architect and educator [[Rifat Chadirji]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/thirdcycle/thirdcycle_chairman.html Lifetime Achievements of Rifat Chadirji] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004020/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/thirdcycle/thirdcycle_chairman.html |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 to [[Sri Lanka]]n architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/eighthcycle/bawa.htm Lifetime Achievements of Geoffrey Bawa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219135634/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/eighthcycle/bawa.htm |date=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 to historian of Islamic art and architecture [[Oleg Grabar]].&lt;ref name="Grabar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/Content/1037|title=Speech by Oleg Grabar, Recipient of the 2010 Chairman's Award - Aga Khan Development Network|website=www.akdn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion===
The Aga Khan Foundation funded the television series ''Architects on the Frontline'' which was about entries to the competition. The media watchdog [[Ofcom]] criticised [[BBC World News]] for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules with the series, which praised the competition; viewers were not informed that it was sponsored content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33971919|title=News channels breached sponsorship rules, Ofcom says|date=18 August 2015|access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award cycles==
Prizes totalling up to US$ 1m, constituting the largest architectural award in the world,&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt; are presented every three years to projects selected by the Master Jury.&lt;ref name="CanadianArc"/&gt; Since 1977, documentation has been compiled on over 7500 building projects located throughout the world, of which over 100 projects have received awards.&lt;ref name="CanadArc2013"/&gt;

The 1986 award ceremony took place at [[El Badi Palace]] in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]]. The [[Brief (architecture)|brief]] prepared by the Steering Committee for this award cycle focused on the preservation and continuation of cultural heritage, community building and social housing, and excellence in contemporary architectural expression.

Six winners were chosen from among 213 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198706/the.changing.present.htm |title=The Changing Present, Loughran, G., Saudi Aramco World, Nov/Dec 1987: 28-37 |accessdate=2006-12-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061229124620/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198706/the.changing.present.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservation of Mostar Old Town and restoration of Al-Aqsa Mosque were examples of cultural heritage, the first theme, while the Yama Mosque and Bhong Mosque were noted for their innovation in translating traditional techniques and materials to meet contemporary requirements. The Social Security Complex and Dar Lamane Housing address the issues of community and social housing while remaining sensitive to local culture. The Chairman's Award for Lifetime Achievements was given to [[Iraq]]i architect [[Rifat Chadirji]].

The fourth cycle of the award considered 241 project nominations. Of these, 32 were short-listed for technical review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198906/better.by.design.htm |title=Better by Design, Loughran, G., Saudi Aramco World, Nov/Dec 1989: 28-33 |accessdate=2006-12-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061229121526/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198906/better.by.design.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Master Jury selected 11 winners. Two themes were noted as areas of focus in this cycle: Revival of past vernacular traditions, and projects that reflect the efforts of individual patrons and of non-governmental organisations in improving society.

Projects such as the Great Omari Mosque and the Rehabilitation of Asilah seek to reconstruct and preserve heritage buildings for continued use, demonstrating the significance of these spaces within their communities. Meanwhile, the Grameen Bank Housing Programme and Sidi el-Aloui Primary School apply architectural solutions to address current socioeonomic issues.

===Seventh (1996-1998)===
The 1998 award ceremony took place at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]]. The Master Jury selected seven winning projects of the 424 presented. During this cycle, special emphasis was placed on projects that responded creatively to the emerging forces of [[globalization]]. Issues such as [[demographic pressure]], [[environmental degradation]], and the crisis of the [[nation-state]], and the changes in lifestyle, cultural values, and relationships among social groups and between governments and people at large they prompted, were considered.

Of the winning projects, the rehabilitation of Hebron Old Town and Slum Networking of Indore City sought to reclaim community space in environments strained by social, physical and environmental degradation. The Lepers Hospital created a sustainable and dignified shelter for a marginalized segment of society. The remaining projects were recognized for their contribution in evolving an architectural vocabulary in response to contemporary social and environmental challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cynthia C.

'''Alliance Graphique Internationale''' (AGI) is a club of the world’s leading [[graphic artist]]s and [[designer]]s. There are 497 members from 39 countries.  Its members have been collectively responsible for the identity design of most of the world's top corporations and institutions as well as for countless examples of globally known packaging, publications, illustration and posters. [[:fr:Bernard_Baissait|Bernard Baissait]] is the only member who left the AGI following disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bernardbaissait.fr/cv.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1951 two Swiss and three French graphic artists decided to formalise their relationship into a kind of association. In 1952 the Alliance Graphique Internationale was incorporated in [[Paris]] with 65 members. The first AGI show was in [[Paris]] in 1955. In 1969 the AGI headquarters moved to [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=3 AGI Backwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important events of the organisation are the annual AGI Congress and AGI Open that take place in a different country in each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=2 AGI Outwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American modernism''', much like the [[modernism]] movement in general, is a trend of philosophical thought arising from the widespread changes in culture and society in the age of [[modernity]]. American modernism is an artistic and cultural movement in the United States beginning at the turn of the 20th century, with a core period between World War I and World War II. Like its European counterpart, American modernism stemmed from a rejection of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, seeking to better represent reality in a new, more industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;Singal, Daniel Joseph. "Towards a Definition of American Modernism". ''American Quarterly'' 39.1 (1987): 7–26. Web ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Characteristically, [[modernism|modernist]] art has a tendency to abstraction, is innovative, aesthetic, futuristic and self-referential. It includes [[visual art]], [[literature]], music, film, [[design]], [[architecture]] as well as [[Life style (sociology)|life style]]. It reacts against [[historicism (art)|historicism]], artistic conventions and [[institutionalization]] of art. Art was not only to be dealt with in academies, theaters or concert halls, but to be included in everyday life and accessible for everybody. Furthermore, cultural institutions concentrated on [[fine art]] and scholars paid little attention to the revolutionary styles of modernism. Economic and technological progress in the U.S. during the [[Roaring Twenties]] gave rise to widespread [[utopianism]], which influenced some modernist artists, while others were skeptical of the embrace of technology. The victory in World War I confirmed the status of the U.S. as an international player and gave the people self-confidence and a feeling of security. In this context, American modernism marked the beginning of American art as distinct and autonomous from European taste, by breaking artistic conventions that had been shaped after European traditions until then.

American modernism benefited from the diversity of immigrant cultures. Artists were inspired by African, Caribbean, Asian and European folk cultures and embedded these exotic styles in their works.

The Modernist American movement was a reflection of American life in the 20th century. In the quickly industrializing world and hastened pace of life, it was easy for the individual to be swallowed up by the vastness of things, left wandering, devoid of purpose. Social boundaries in race, class, sex, wealth and religion were being challenged. As the social structure was challenged by new incoming views, the bounds of traditional standards and social structure dissolved, and a loss of identity was what remained, translating eventually into isolation, alienation and an overall feeling of separateness from any kind of "whole". The unity of a war-rallied country was dying, along with it the illusion of the pleasantries it sold to its soldiers and people. The world was left violent, vulgar and spiritually empty.

The middle class worker fell into a distinctly unnoticeable position, a cog much too small to hope to find recognition in a much greater machine. Citizens were overcome with their own futility. Youths' dreams shattered with failure and a disillusioning disappointment in recognition of limit and loss. The lives of the disillusioned and outcasts became more focal. Ability to define self through hard work and resourcefulness, to create your own vision of yourself without the help of traditional means, became prized. Some authors endorsed this, while others, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, challenged how alluring but destructively false the values of privilege can be.

Modernist America had to find common ground in a world no longer unified in belief. The unity found lay in the common ground of the shared consciousness within all human experience. The importance of the individual was emphasized; the truly limited nature of the human experience formed a bond across all bridges of race, class, sex, wealth or religion. Society, in this way, found shared meaning, even in disarray.

Some see modernism in the tradition of 19th century [[aestheticism]] and the "[[art for art's sake]]" movement. [[Clement Greenberg]] argues that modernist art excludes "anything outside itself". Others see modernist art, for example in [[blues]] and [[jazz]] music, as a medium for emotions and moods, and many works dealt with contemporary issues, like feminism and city life. Some artists and theoreticians even added a political dimension to American modernism.

American modernist design and architecture enabled people to lead a modern life. Work and family life changed radically and rapidly due to the economic upswing during the 1920s. In the U.S., the car became popular and affordable for many, leisure time and entertainment gained importance and the job market opened up for women. In order to make life more efficient, designers and architects aimed at the simplification of housework.

The [[Great Depression]] at the end of the '20s and during the '30s disillusioned people about the economic stability of the country and eroded utopianist thinking. The outbreak and the terrors of World War II caused further changes in mentality. The [[Post-war]] period that followed was termed [[Late Modernism]]. The ''[[Postmodernist]]'' era was generally considered characteristic of the art of the late 20th century beginning in the 1980s.

==Jazz==
:''For a wider, more formal account, please see [[Jazz]] and [[Jazz Age]]''.
Early in the 20th century, [[jazz]] evolved from the [[blues]] tradition, but also incorporated many other musical and cultural elements. In [[New Orleans]], often considered the birthplace of jazz, musicians benefited from the influx of Spanish and French colonial influences. In this city, a unique ethnic cultural mix and looser racial prohibitions allowed African Americans more influence than in other regions of the South. The [[Spanish–American War]] brought Northern soldiers to the region with their bands. The resulting music adopted sounds from the new brass instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John. ''Blues and jazz in American Culture''. Bielefeld University, Bielefeld (Germany). 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], jazz spread from New Orleans to New York, Chicago, and other cities, incorporating new sounds along the way. [[Harlem]], New York City, became the new center for the [[jazz age]].&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, Frank A. "Expatriate Jazz Musicians in Europe." Ed. William Boelhower, et al. ''Sites of Ethnicity: Europe and the Americas''. Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag Winter GmbH, 2004. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz – music of integration===
[[Jazz]] music, as a central element of American culture, has its roots in Black slave culture. The music combined elements from African call and response patterns into its instrumentation and riffs.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, Nathan Irvin. ''Harlem Renaissance''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; In its beginnings jazz was looked critically upon by parts of the white population, who thought that jazz and [[ragtime]] rhythms were "savage crash and bang,"&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lawrence W. "Jazz and American Culture." Ed. Robert O'Meally. ''The Jazz Cadence of American Culture''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and denigrated the genre as a product "not of innovators, but of incompetents."&lt;ref&gt;Levine 437, ''NY Times'', 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Its expressive and pulsating style initially served racial stereotypes in the public mind and was widely encountered with skeptical rejection. Despite this phenomenon of animosity towards a rising Black cultural significance, American writer Lawrence W. Levine interprets the role of jazz as a catalyst of a shifting national consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Culturally, we remained to a much larger extent than we have yet recognized, a colonized people attempting to define itself in the shadow of the former imperial power. Jazz was an expression of that other side of ourselves that strove to recognize the positive aspects of our newness and our heterogeneity; that learned to be comfortable with the fact that a significant part of our heritage derived from Africa and other non-European sources; and that recognized in the various syncretized cultures that became so characteristic of the United States an embarrassing weakness but a dynamic source of strength.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After all, it was in the nature of jazz to strive for cultural convergence between blacks and whites; according to saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], "Jazz has always been a music of integration."&lt;ref&gt;Levine 440&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s jazz gained considerably in popularity and aroused increasing interest in young whites who were attracted by the artistic, personal as well as cultural freedom of expression this new musical form had to offer. Well-known white musicians such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Gene Krupa]], Milton Mezzrow, [[Muggsy Spanier]] or [[Joe Sullivan]] were inspired by Afro-American icons like [[Louis Armstrong]]. The acceptance of jazz soon spread across the Atlantic and, by the mid-20th century, made it international. Today, jazz music is regarded as an integral and vibrant part of American culture, the unique native music of America, a worldwide representative of Afro-American culture.

===Jazz as American===
A compilation article appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1923 proclaimed jazz, "... a contribution of America to the arts. It is recognized the world over as part of a musical folk lore of this country: it is as thoroughly and typically American as the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the [[Fourth of July]], or [[baseball]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Say Jazz Will Live." ''The New York Times''. 23 December 1923: Page XX4&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz's American-ness begins with its roots. Jazz was a product of African Americans, a cultural group distinct to America. Though the early [[blues]] sang distinctly of the sorrows of a displaced people, jazz was something else. The African American labor class who gave birth to jazz were not subject to the education of other white musicians; black minstrels were able to escape the pressure to "Europeanize" their art. Culture (with a capital C) essentially demanded that Americans prefer, commend, and reiterate all things European. Free from these constraints, jazz progressed in an uncharted manner.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Irving Berlin]] called jazz "American folk music" and cited influences ranging from "old Southern Songs" and the "Negro spirituals", to a "tinge of the Russian and Italian folk songs", but Berlin concluded that it was "typically American above all."&lt;ref&gt;"Berlin Calls Jazz American Folk Music." ''The New York Times''. 10 January 1925. pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the nation where it was created, jazz blended separate [[ethnic]] and cultural influences into a new and different product, combining elements from Black identity with other immigrant influences. It incorporated the sounds of the South and the modern, and adapted elements from urban skylines.&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven, John A. "What's 'American' About America." Ed. Robert O'Meally. ''The Jazz Cadence of American Culture''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz was distinctly American in that it blended the character of different peoples, but still let the individual have his chance to express himself in an improvisational solo,&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven 128&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore asserted the "rugged individualism"&lt;ref&gt;Zelinsky, Wilbur. ''The Cultural Geography of the United States''. Trenton: Prentice Hall. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that already characterized the nation. Furthermore, jazz began to break down the barrier between performer and audience. It "democratized" culture, making it accessible to the common person.&lt;ref name="Levine 433"&gt;Levine 433&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz as modern===
Jazz is distinctly modern in sound and manner. According to Lawrence Levine, "Jazz was, or seemed to be the product of a new age ... raucous, discordant ... accessible, spontaneous ... openly an interactive, participatory music."&lt;ref name="Levine 433"/&gt; Daniel Gregory Mason charged that jazz "is so perfectly adapted to robots that the one could be deduced from the other. Jazz is thus the exact musical reflection of modernist industrial capitalism", and jazz has also been likened to the sound of riveting.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 437&lt;/ref&gt; Irving Berlin called jazz the "music of the machine age."&lt;ref&gt;Whiteman, Paul. "In Defense of Jazz and its Makers." ''The New York Times''. 13 March 1927. pg. SM4.&lt;/ref&gt; Players drew influences from everyday street talk in Harlem, as well as from French Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon 256&lt;/ref&gt; The improvised nature begs the player to dismantle and examine pre-existing structure within the music.&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven 127–130&lt;/ref&gt; As tribute to the modernity of jazz, one only needs to examine the various media that drew influences from the music. The musical ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' is one of the earliest and most successful jazz adaptation to the stage,&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 291&lt;/ref&gt; jazz ballets appeared in New York City's Metropolitan Theatre, [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]] drew poetry from the Jazz music they experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 223&lt;/ref&gt; and jazz music colored the paintings of [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], and many others.

There is no single date for the beginning of the modern era in America, as dozens of painters were active at the beginning of the 20th century. It was the time when the first [[cubism|cubist]] landscapes, still-life  and portraits appeared; bright colors entered the palettes of painters, and the first [[Geometric abstraction|non-objective]] paintings were displayed in the galleries.

The modernist movement during the formative years was also becoming popular in New York City by 1913 at the popular Manhattan studio gallery of [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) and through the work of the Whitney Studio Cub in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor Emeritus James K. Kettlewell: Harvard, Skidmore College, Curator The Hyde Collection. Foreword to The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm: {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davidson, the beginning of American modernist painting can be dated to the 1910s. The early part of the period lasted 25 years and ended around 1935, when modern art was referred to as, what [[Clement Greenberg|Greenberg]] called the [[avant-garde]].

The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City displayed the contemporary work of European artists, as well as Americans. The [[Impressionist]], [[Fauvist]] and [[Cubist]] paintings startled many American viewers who were accustomed to more conventional art. However, inspired by what they saw, many American artists were influenced by the radical and new ideas.

The early 20th century was marked by the exploration of different techniques and ways of artistic expressiveness. Many American artists like [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong|Wilhelmina Weber]], [[Man Ray]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and others went to Europe, notably Paris, to make art. The formation of various artistic assemblies led to the multiplicity of meaning in the visual arts. The [[Ashcan School]] gathered around [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] ([[Robert Henri]] or [[George Luks]]); the [[Alfred Stieglitz|Stieglitz]] circle glorified abstract visions of New York City ([[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Abraham Walkowitz]]); color painters evolved in direction of the colorful, abstract "[[Synchromism|synchromies]]" ([[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]]), whereas [[precisionism]] visualized  the industrialized landscape of America in the form of sharp and dynamic geometrization ([[Joseph Stella]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] and [[Charles Demuth]]). Eventually  artists like [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who was thought of as the mother of American Modernism, [[John Marin]], [[Arthur Beecher Carles]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], [[James Daugherty]], [[John Covert (painter)|John Covert]], [[Henrietta Shore]], [[William Zorach]], [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite Thompson]] (Zorach), [[Manierre Dawson]], [[Arnold Friedman]] and [[Oscar Bluemner]] ushered in the era of [[Modernism]] to the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

The shift of focus and multiplicity of subjects in the visual arts is also a hallmark of American modernist art. Thus, for example, the group [[Ashcan School|The Eight]] brought the focus on the modern city, and placed emphasis on the diversity of different classes of citizens. Two of the most significant representatives of The Eight, Robert Henri and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] made paintings about social diversity, often taking as a main subject the slum dwellers of industrialized cities. The late 1920s and the 1930s belonged (among many others) to two movements in American painting, [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] and [[Social Realism]]. The regionalists focused on the colorfulness of the American landscape and the complexities of country life, whereas the social realists went into the subjects of the [[Great Depression]], poverty, and social injustice. The social realists protested against the government and the establishment that appeared hypocritical, biased, and indifferent to the matters of human inequalities. Abstraction, landscape and music were popular modernist themes during the first half of the 20th century. Artists like Charles Demuth who created his masterpiece ''I Saw The Figure Five in Gold'' in 1928, [[Morton Schamberg]] (1881–1918) and [[Charles Sheeler]] were closely related to the [[Precisionism|Precisionist movement]] as well. Sheeler typically painted cityscapes and industrial architecture as exemplified by his painting ''Amoskeag Canal'' 1948. [[Jazz]] and music were improvisationally represented by [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], as exemplified by ''Hot Still-Scape for Six Colors – 7th Avenue Style,'' from 1940.

Modernism bridged the gap between the art and a socially diverse audience in the U.S. A growing number of museums and galleries aimed at bringing modernity to the general public. Despite initial resistance to the celebration of progress, technology, and urban life, the visual arts contributed enormously to the self-consciousness and awareness of the American people. New modernist painting shined a light on the emotional and psychic states of the audience, which was fundamental to the formation of an American identity.

Numerous directions of American "modernism" did not result in one coherent style, but evoked the desire for experiments and challenges. It proved that modern art goes beyond fixed principles.

====Modernist painting====
{{main|Modernism|History of painting|Western painting}}
[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], known as the "Mother of American modernism", has been a major figure in American Modernism since the 1920s. She has received widespread recognition, for challenging the boundaries of modern American artistic style. She is chiefly known for paintings of flowers, rocks, shells, animal bones and landscapes in which she synthesized abstraction and representation. ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' from 1935 is a well known painting by O'Keeffe.
[[Image:O'Keeffe Georgia Ram's Head.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' 1935]]
[[Image:Me and the Moon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Arthur Dove]], ''Me and the Moon'' 1937]]
[[Arthur Dove]] used a wide range of media, sometimes in unconventional combinations to produce his abstractions and his abstract landscapes. ''Me and the Moon'' from 1937 is a good example of an Arthur Dove abstract landscape and has been referred to as one of the culminating works of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/publications/essay-prize/2012-essay-prize-jennifer-stettler-parsons|title=2012 Essay Prize: Jennifer Stettler Parsons|first=Emily D.|last=Shapiro|date=8 January 2012|website=si.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove did a series of experimental collage works in the 1920s.  He also experimented with techniques, combining paints like hand mixed oil or tempera over a wax emulsion.

African-American painter [[Aaron Douglas]] (1899–1979) is one of the best-known and most influential African-American modernist painters. His works contributed strongly to the development of an aesthetic movement that is closely related to distinct features of African-American heritage and culture. Douglas influenced African-American visual arts especially during the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

One of Douglas' most popular paintings is ''The Crucifixion''. It was published in James Weldon Johnson's ''God's Trombones'' in 1927. The crucifixion scene that is depicted in the painting shows several elements that constitute Douglas' art: clear-cut delineation, change of shadows and light, stylized human bodies and geometric figures as concentric circles in contrast to linear forms. The painting's theme resembles not only the biblical scene but can also be seen as an allusion to African-American religious tradition: the oversized, dark Jesus is bearing his cross, his eyes directed to heaven from which light is cast down onto his followers. Stylized Roman soldiers are flanking the scene with their pointed spears. As a result, the observer is reminded for instance of the African-American gospel tradition but also of a history of suppression. [[Beauford Delaney]], [[Charles Alston]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Romare Bearden]] were also important [[African-American]] [[Modernist]] painters that inspired generations of artists that followed them.

====Modernist photography====
[[Image:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|''[[Rrose Sélavy]]'' (Marcel Duchamp). 1921. Photograph by [[Man Ray]]. Art Direction by Marcel Duchamp.]]
{{See also|Photo-Secession}}
At the beginning of American modernism, photography still struggled to be recognized as a form of art. The photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] described it as: "Artists who saw my earlier photographs began to tell me that they envied me; that they felt my photographs were superior to their paintings, but that, unfortunately, photography was not an art. I could not understand why the artists should envy me for my work, yet, in the same breath, decry it because it was machine-made." (Stieglitz:8). In 1902, Stieglitz founded the [[Photo-Secession]] group with members such as [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gertrude Käsebier]] and [[Clarence Hudson White]], which had the objective of raising the standard and increasing the awareness of art photography. At that point, their main style was ''[[pictorialist]]'', which was known for modifying photos through soft focus, special filters or exotic printing processes, to imitate the style of paintings and etchings of that time. For means of publication, Stieglitz, as the driving force of the movement, started the magazine ''[[Camera Work]]'', in which he published artists he felt represented the movement. He also ran three galleries one after another, namely "291" (1905–1917), "The Intimate Gallery" (1925–1929) and "An American Place" (1929–1947). Especially 291 served as a meeting point for artists and writers and was the first to exhibit the early modernist art works of European artists, such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], in the United States. A further link to the European avant-garde was established by [[Man Ray]]. Born in America and inspired by the work he saw in Stieglitz' galleries, Ray emigrated to Paris in 1921 and together with artists of the European [[Dada]] and [[Surrealist]] movements created new photographic techniques such as [[rayographs]] (placing objects directly on photosensitive paper).

In the early 1920s, photographers moved towards what they called ''[[straight photography]]''. In contrast to the pictorialist style, they now rejected any kind of manipulation in the photographic process (e.g., soft lens, special developing or printing methods) and tried to use the advantages of the camera as a unique medium for capturing reality. Their motifs were supposed to look as objective as possible. Turning the focus away from classic portraiture and the pictorialist style, the photographers started using their pictures as means for representing the harsh realities of everyday life, but at the same time tried to search for the beauty in the detail or the overall aesthetical structure. Machines and factory work, sky scrapers and technical innovations became prominent motifs.
In 1932 some younger photographers (e.g. [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], [[Edward Weston]]) started [[Group f/64]] based on the ideals of straight photography, which became the most progressive association of its time.

==Feminism, gender, and sexuality==

===Development of feminism===
Starting from the early 19th century, some women used the doctrines of the ideal femaleness to avoid the isolation of the domestic sphere. By the 1830s, women were openly challenging the women's sphere and demanding greater political, economic and social rights. They formed women's clubs and benevolent societies all over the U.S. Male domination of the public arena was no longer within acceptable limits to many of these middle-class activist women. Beginning with the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848, American feminists held state and national conventions until the early 20th century. Some spokeswomen of the feminist movement connected the feminist cause with free love and the sexual revolution, which were the taboo issues of the [[Victorian Age]]. Therefore, feminists in both Britain and the United States concentrated on political and legal issues, the vote in particular, and other important women's issues regarding the domestic roles of women and the organization of domestic life in general. Eventually, after a long and hard struggle that included massive, sometimes violent protests, the imprisonment of many women, and even some deaths, the battle for [[women's suffrage]] was won. The suffrage law was passed in the United States in 1920 for women who were householders or wives of householders and in 1928 for all adult women. (African-American women were not included. They only received the right to vote in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s.) The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was founded in 1966 by a group of feminists. The largest women's rights group in the U.S. NOW aimed to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. The following years of the late 20th century witnessed a great expansion of women's rights in all areas of the modern society.
Modernist artists had an ambivalent attitude towards feminism: on the one hand they opted for equal treatment of men and women with regard to law, franchise, and professions; on the other hand they still had the perceived female inadequacies in terms of biology, culture, and transcendence in mind. As the radical feminist [[Emma Goldman]] proclaimed, "true liberation begins neither at the polls nor in courts [but rather] in a woman's soul" (qtd. in Lyon 223).

===Gender and sexuality===
The roles of gender and sexuality in American modernism were elaborated through studies of national identity and citizenship, racial identity and race politics, queer identity and aesthetics, magazine culture, visual culture, market economies, and historical accounts of 20th century political modernity. Immense work done by scholars of feminism, gender, and sexuality helped to restructure the field of American modernist scholarship. Women writers have become the subjects of extensive literary study. Gay and lesbian communities have been revalued as patterns of modern aesthetic experimentation, and sexual identity and gender formation were interpreted in a new way.

The turn of the 20th century cultural life saw a shift to a dichotomy of mass culture versus high culture, with the former generally thought feminine, and high culture thought male-oriented. Formerly denounced popular fiction now served the feminist purpose. "It formed the bedrock for defenses of a new phase of free love and the concomitant promotion of birth control." (Lyon 225)

The upcoming interest in popular psychology, especially [[Freudian]] theories, encouraged this new approach to gender roles and sexuality in the arts. Sexual difference was portrayed by women themselves with the help of the media available to them. This manifested itself for example in [[Mina Loy]]'s "sex-talk" which is "stunning both for the focus it places on a woman's sexual disappointment and for the balance it strikes between clinical frankness and poetic indirection" (Lyon 225). It also entailed the breaking up of traditional gender roles. They were no longer exclusively male or female but there was also an acknowledgment of homosexuality, feminine men, and masculine women. Thus the concept of sexuality became multi-layered, as in [[Djuna Barnes]]' novel ''Nightwood'' (1936) in which she obliterates all established ideas of gender and sexuality. This early debate dealing with these issues cleared the way for contemporary approaches to gender, for instance that of [[Judith Butler]] in her book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990).

==American icons in the European mind==

===Definition of "American icon"===

This section focuses on people and objects that represent American modernism. Generally speaking, these famous human beings and well-known objects are called ''icons'' since, apart from radiating an aura of uniqueness as well as originality (cf. Wagner 2006: 121.), they sparked public interest in this period and have had a lasting influence on future generations (cf. Czech 2006: 27–28). Thus, they serve as focal points for collective memory or identity at present (cf. ibid.). Even some people in Europe still recognize them as symbols of American modernism.

The medial/public depiction lays the foundation stone for the creation of icons. In this way, a certain image of a biological person or a real object (''signifier'') is produced and becomes the ''signified'' (cf. Volkmann 2006: 94–96). The emanated ''configuration of signs'' (cf. ibid. 96) helps turn ''the signified'' into an icon, if it captures the atmosphere of a particular period/country and is acknowledged by contemporary societies as well as future generations.

===New York City===

''To read more about New York City, please see [[New York City]]''

New York City is one of the most iconic cities in the United States and one of the major global cities of the world due to its important business, financial, trading and cultural organizations, such as Wall Street, United Nations, the Metropolitan Museum of Arts and Broadway theaters with their (in that time innovative) electric lighting. It is regarded as the birthplace of many American cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and [[abstract expressionism]] in visual art.

New York City is iconic not only for Americans, but also for many Europeans as the city of melting pot where many ethnic groups live, often in specific neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, Little Italy. In American modernism, New York became the first stop for immigrants seeking a better life. The city's population boomed, 5 boroughs were formed, the New York City Subway was opened and became a symbol of progress and innovation. The city saw construction of skyscrapers in the skyline.

"Take New York City skyline, for example – that ragged man-made Sierra at the eastern edge of the continent. Clearly, in the minds of immigrants and returning travelers, in the iconography of the admen who use it as a backdrop for the bourbon and airplane luggage they are selling, the eyes of poets and of military strategies, it is one of the prime symbols" (Kouwenhoven 1998: 124). Iconic is especially the Manhattan skyline and its structural properties. It is regarded as a symbol of American progress and competition in height, creativity of structure, advancement and efficiency. It is considered an icon of "architectural individualism" (cf. ibid.  125). The typical gridiron pattern of the city's streets  is an icon of simplicity (cf. ibid 127), while vertical steel construction of many stories is an icon of progress and innovation.

====Charlie Chaplin====
[[Charlie Chaplin]] is regarded as a film icon. Born in London, and while not a U.S. citizen, he had a strong sense of belonging to American society. Chaplin became famous after starring in his first film, ''[[Making a Living]],'' (1914). As a 10-year-old boy "he worked as a mime on the British vaudeville circuit".&lt;ref&gt;(Douglas 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was once very poor inspired his Tramp's trademark. He created a distorted version of a formal dinner suit (as a symbol of an adult man personified) combined with the attitude of an innocent child.

He was the first and the last person who was in charge of every aspect of making his films. He started his own film studio [[United Artists]]; was in charge of directing, writing, editing, producing and casting the films in which he played. It is said that he changed the film industry into an art form in the first decades of the 20th century. It was his personality, and his genius with "expressive grace", "endless inventiveness" and creativity that made him an American icon&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;(ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred making silent films, (he made more than 75 silent films) setting the acting and the plot in the center of the action. His best known films are ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936)&lt;ref name="cf. ibid"&gt;(cf. ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was so highly recognizable that a movement of "Chaplinitis" was formed by 1920. There were Chaplin songs, dances, comic books, dolls, and cocktails. Poems were written about him and his pantomime. The [[Beat Generation]] (of writers) made him one of its icons. In the '80s IBM took the Tramp for the logo in their advertisements of personal computers&lt;ref name="cf. ibid"/&gt;

"Every few weeks, outside the movie theater in virtually any American town in the late 1910s, stood the life-size cardboard figure of a small tramp—outfitted in tattered, baggy pants, a cutaway coat and vest, impossibly large, worn-out shoes and a battered derby hat—bearing the inscription ''I AM HERE TODAY".'' "The endearing figure of his [[Little Tramp]] was instantly recognizable around the globe and brought laughter to millions. Still is. Still does"&lt;ref name="ibid"/&gt;

During the McCarthy era he was attacked and condemned by some for the increasingly politicized messages of his films; and he was accused of "anti-American activities" and of being a suspected communist supporter. He maintained his British citizenship, and after a trip to England in 1952 and for many years he wasn't allowed to re-enter the U.S. Finally in 1972 he triumphantly returned and was awarded an honorary [[Academy Award|Oscar]]. He is perceived today as an American film icon due to the charm and brilliance of his films.

===The Model-T Ford===

Icons are usually capable of conveying, on the one hand, awareness of tradition and, on the other hand, the notion of progress (cf. www.ikonothek.de). At this point, it is worth mentioning some concepts of modernism in the U.S., namely ''the sense of forward-looking contemporaneity'' (Wilk 2006: 2) ''the be-lief in the power and potential of the machine and industrial technology'' (ibid. 3) and the emphasis on ''process'' (Kouwenhoven 1998: 133–136).  All these aspects can be associated with the 1913 Model-T Ford. By using assembly-line systems, ''Henry Ford and his men applied continuous-process principles'' (Strasser 1989: 6) during its production. What should be mentioned, in this context, is the fact many unskilled immigrants were employed by the expanded Ford factory in order to meet the increasing demand for this material icon of American modernism on the emerging mass market. In consequence, the foreign workers' contribution also underscored the myth of ''The American Melting Pot'' (see also: Meyer 1998).

Today, the Model-T Ford continues to represent the idea of process and mobility. Therefore, although modernism aimed at rejecting any form of tradition and history, this icon transmits, up to a certain degree, a sense of tradition.

==Everyday life and culture==

The modernist movement caused vast changes in societies in which it took place. With the introduction of industrial developments, the American people started to enjoy the outcome of the new modernist era. Everyday life and culture are the areas that reflected the social change in the habits of the society. Developments that occurred with modernism influenced American people life standards and gave way to new style of living.

Widespread use of electricity and mass production of technological house appliances like refrigerator brought about the change of eating habits of American people. Use of frozen food became more common. After the war &lt;!--WHICH WAR?--&gt; the U.S. government passed new laws concerning food. So some new foods came right out of the ration kits to the stores. "Foods formerly manufactured solely for army use were put on the civilian market", Frozen and dried food products also became popular after the war. National Research Corporation of Boston introduced frozen orange juice concentrate called "tang." The company became Minute Maid, and, by 1950, a quarter of Florida's orange crop was going into concentrates. The frozen product quickly overtook fresh squeezed orange juice in most American homes. Full frozen meals were not far behind. In the 1950s, a Nebraska company Swanson's brought out their TV Dinners to great success.

These changes in eating habits caused huge changes in appliances, transportation and farming. Since people began buying the new products, new refrigerators were quickly developed with bigger freezer sections Shock resistant refrigerator units for trucks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/money_14.html |title=A Revolution in Transportation for Agriculture during the 1940s |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; had to be invented and used by the military before frozen products could distributed and marketed around the country and around the world. These developments forced farmers to change what they grew and how they grew their products to meet new consumer demands.

In the following are there a few of the foods that were first produced and sold in the 1940s.

– Mrs. Paul's frozen fish sticks&lt;br /&gt;
– Cheerios (first sold as Cheeri Oats, the first ready-to-eat oat cereal) and Kellogg's Raisin Bran&lt;br /&gt;
– Minute Rice&lt;br /&gt;
– Reddi-Whip whipped cream&lt;br /&gt;
– Nestles Quick powdered drink mix&lt;br /&gt;
– Packaged cake mixes&lt;br /&gt;
– M&amp;Ms Chocolate Candies, Peppermint Patty, Junior Mints, Almond Joy, Whoppers malted milk balls, Jolly Rancher Candies&lt;br /&gt;
– Deep Dish Pizza (Pizzeria Uno, Chicago)

With the increasing number of automobiles, American people started to get out of their homes and had dinner outside. However, during the war &lt;!--WHICH WAR?--&gt; people drove their cars as little as possible. Gas and tires were limited by the government. Car production ceased as factories had to manufacture tanks, Jeeps and other military vehicles. After the war families piled into cars again, as a consequence, new highways were built. The number of drive-ins  increased immediately. Drive-ins became part of the social life in America by the end of 1940.

Modernism showed its effects nearly in all areas. One of the immense developments was to supply the rural areas with the electricity. The REA, Rural Electrification Administration, began in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/life_08.html |title=Bringing Electricity in Rural America |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it took time to build power lines scores of miles into rural areas. Throughout the 1940s, the REA continued to build the electricity lines.

Electricity changed the lives of farm families, from the moment they got up early in the morning, through meals, chores, and work until they went to bed at night. Electricity brought power for lights to work, read, and sew at night; power for appliances like refrigerators and freezers to preserve food; power for small kitchen devices such as mixers and blenders; and power for other labor saving devices such as electric stoves, irons and clothes washers. Electricity brought changes that just made life safer and better – like colored lights instead of dangerous candles on Christmas trees, refrigerators to keep food fresh and electric fans to bring relief on a hot summer day.
 
:In 1930, only 13 percent of farms had electricity.
:By the early 1940s, only 33 percent of farms had electricity.
:Locally in York, Nebraska, the Perennial Public Power District had strung nearly 250 miles of electric line to more than 500 customers by September 1945.
:By 1950 nearly all of Nebraska farms were "hooked up", and electricity replaced kerosene lanterns in homes and barns.

There were some crucial steps taken in the communication and media devices like the invention of radio and television.

Radio was the nation's first mass medium, linking the country and ending the isolation of rural residents. Radio was so important that the 1930 Census asked if the household had a radio. Radio provided free entertainment (after you bought the radio) and connected country people to world events. Walter Winchell and Lowell Thomas were popular news commentators on the radio.

:Families laughed at comedians Jack Benny, Fred Allen, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Amos and Andy, and Fibber McGee and Molly.
:Radio featured daytime soap operas.
:In the evening, people listened to the Lone Ranger, the Green Hornet, The Shadow, and Jack Armstrong.
:Singers Bing Crosby and the Mills Brothers, as well as Guy Lombardo's orchestra and the Grand Ole Opry were popular.
:Families listened to baseball, cheering for stars like Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. Nearly 40 million people listened to the horserace between Seabiscuit and War Admiral in Maryland.
:In news coverage, the German airship Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 as it landed in New Jersey. Thousands of people across the country heard Herb Morrison describe the terrifying scene on live radio, saying "Oh the humanity!"

The first practical TV sets were demonstrated and sold to the public at the 1939 World's Fair in New York. The sets were very expensive and New York City had the only broadcast station. When World War II started, all commercial production of television equipment was banned. Production of the cathode ray tubes that produced the pictures was redirected to radar and other high tech war uses. After the war television was something few had heard of. That changed quickly. In 1945, a poll asked Americans, "Do you know what television is?" Most didn't. But four years later, most Americans had heard of television and wanted one! According to one survey in 1950, before they got a TV, people listened to radio an average of nearly five hours a day. Within nine months after they bought a TV they listened to radio, but only for two hours a day. They watched TV for five hours a day. The 1940s TVs didn't look like today's televisions. Most had picture screens between 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide diagonally, inside large, heavy cabinets. And, of course, color broadcasts and sets didn't arrive until much later, in 1954.

===Fashion===

''For a further, more formal account, please see [[Fashion]]''

Referring to fashion, usually one would think of dressing styles or costumes. Of course, dressing style is a very important category of the word "fashion". On the other hand, "fashion" has more meanings and could be explained and found in many other fields, such as architecture, body type, dance and music, and even forms of speech, etc.

'''1. Costumes'''

In the early 1920s, the ready-to-wear fashion began to spread America. More women earned their own wages and didn't want to spend time on fittings. Fashion as the status symbol was no more important as class distinctions were becoming blurred. People especially women called for inexpensive fashion. In the aspect of mass production of contemporary style clothing for women, America went ahead of other countries. Several designers of this fashion including [[Jane Derby]] made a stage pose.

'''''Women:''''' By 1921 the longer skirt, which was usually long and uneven at the bottom was out of date. The short skirt became popular by 1925. No bosom, no waistline, and hair nearly hidden under a cloche hat. The manufacturing of cosmetics also began from this decade. Powder, lipstick, rouge, eyebrow pencil, eye shadow, colored nails, women had them all. Moreover, pearls came in fashion as well.

'''''Men:''''' In this period, clothing for men was more conservative. Trousers widened to 24&amp;nbsp;inches at the bottoms. Knickers, increased the width and length, were called ''plus fours''. In summer, white linen was popular, while in the winter an American coat—the raccoon coat—was in fashion. The slouch hat, made of felt, could be rolled up and packed into a suitcase. These were very popular with college men.

'''2. Furniture'''
There's no pure American modern style in the designing world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The American modern artists inherited the style characterized by simplicity of form, absence of decorative ornament, and focused on functional concerns from their precedents. At the same time, the American designers blended the wild style of Parisian painting, as well as the features of modern architecture in their works, such as Art Deco. Moreover, the designers also placed much emphasis on the materials, especially those invented in the modern age.

==American modernist literature==

American modernist literature was a dominant trend in American literature between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The modernist era highlighted innovation in the form and language of poetry and prose, as well as addressing numerous contemporary topics, such as race relations, gender and the human condition. Many American modernists became expatriated in Europe during this time, often becoming stalwarts in the European movement, as was the case for [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. These writers were often known as The Lost Generation.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, David, and David C. Ward. "Lighting Out for the Territories: American Expatriates, Paris, and Modernism". ''The Sewanee Review'' 105.3 (1997): 423–427. Web ...&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to this trend, many American authors and poets began a trend of 'nativism', seeking to represent the modern American experience in America. Notable contributors to this trend include [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Marianne Moore]]. These poets were often critical of the works of expatriate writers such as Eliot and Pound, as evidenced by poems like [[Spring and All]].

Influenced by the first World War, many American modernist writers explored the psychological wounds and spiritual scars of the war experience. The economic crisis in America at the beginning of the 1930s also left a mark on literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. A related issue is the loss of self and need for self-definition, as workers faded into the background of city life, unnoticed cogs within a machine yearning for self-definition. American modernists echoed the mid-19th-century focus on the attempt to "build a self"—a theme illustrated by Fitzgerald's ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. Madness and its manifestations seems to be another favorite modernist theme, as seen in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', Hemingway's ''[[The Battler]]'' and Faulkner's ''[[That Evening Sun]]''. Nevertheless, all these negative aspects led to new hopes and aspirations, and to the search for a new beginning, not only for the contemporary individuals, but also for the fictional characters in American modernist literature.

Modernist literature also allowed for the development of regional trends within American literature, including the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and southern modernism. The Harlem Renaissance marked a rebirth for African American arts, centralized in the Harlem area of New York. Writers and thinkers such as [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]] were among the key figures of the movement. The movement was connected to a vogue for African American culture, as seen too in the popularity of Jazz music, with many writers financed by white patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/dkv/tools/0746/web/s5/s5_2.html|title=The Rise of Consumer Culture|author=|date=|website=c250.columbia.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers of this movement used modernist techniques to represent African American life, for instance incorporating the rhythms of Jazz music and dialects of African American culture into poetry and prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.05.x.html|title=89.01.05: The Impact of the Music of the Harlem Renaissance on Society|author=|date=|website=www.yale.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern modernism similarly represented the life and unique experiences of the South using modernist aesthetics, with celebrated figures including [[William Faulkner]] and [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cCd5woijF3oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=southern+modernism&amp;ots=i3fI7E7gdW&amp;sig=TmTRKhphg0zFspnrdCfeIbUBfr0&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Nation's Region: Southern Modernism, Segregation, and U.S. Nationalism|first=Leigh Anne|last=Duck|date=10 April 2018|publisher=University of Georgia Press|accessdate=10 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new criticism in America===

From the 1930s to the 1960s, [[New Criticism]] became a critical force in the United States. It was the most powerful perspective in American literary criticism. The representatives were [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Robert Penn Warren]]. "The influential critical methods these poet-professors developed emphasized the sharpening of close reading skills. New Criticism privileged the evaluation of poetry as the justification of literary scholarship". ''Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry'' (1938) became one of the most influential college poetry textbooks of the 1930s and was revised and reprinted well into the 1970s. (Morrisson: 29).

New criticism showed itself in such works as [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]'s and [[Yeats]]' poems. "Poetry that best fit the aesthetic criteria of the New Critics was emphasized in important classroom teaching anthologies" (Morrisson: 29).
T. S. Eliot redefined tradition in his essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent". He formulated such critical concepts as "objective correlative", and rethought the literary canon in his elevation of Jacobean drama and metaphysical poetry. His work had a fundamental influence on New Criticism in America.

==Architecture and space==

The United States played a great role in the modernism movement concerning new advanced building and construction technologies.
Among construction innovations there are such materials as iron, steel and reinforced concrete.
Brooklyn Bridge by John and Washington Roebling (1869–1883) (for more details see [[John Roebling]]/Washington Roebling)

[[Louis Henry Sullivan]] headed the so-called Chicago school of architecture, which was distinct by its development of functional design along with modern materials. Sullivan's follower [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] absorbed from his 'lieber Master' (dear master) the German romantic tradition of organic architecture. He developed a new and original approach to residential design before World War I, which became known as the "prairie style." It combined open planning principles with horizontal emphasis, asymmetrical facade elevations, and broad, sheltering roofs. Robie House in Chicago (1909) and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City (1946–59) are two of his seminal works.

In his works Wright moved closer and closer to an earth-bound sense of natural form, using rough-hewn stone and timber and aiming always in his houses to achieve an effect of intimate and protective shelter.

Foreign-born architects as [[Richard Neutra]], [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]], and [[William Lescaze]] during the 1920s played a great role in development of American architecture performing later a style, which got the name of [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and was reflected in the design of corporate office buildings after World War II. Such buildings as Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Lever House (1952) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building (1956–58) in New York City are the examples of this new style. When such famous Europeans as [[Walter Gropius]] and  [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] immigrated to the United States, many American architectural schools went under the influence of the traditions of the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany.

[[File:Sheikh-Lotf-Allah mosque wall and ceiling 2.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan, Iran]]]]
'''[[Aniconism]]''' is a proscription in [[Islam]] against the creation of images of sentient beings. The most absolute proscription is of images of [[God in Islam]], followed by [[depictions of Muhammad]], and then [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophets]] and the [[Ahl al-Bayt|relatives of Muhammad]], but the depiction of all humans and non-human animals is discouraged in the ''[[hadith]]'' and by the long tradition of Islamic authorities, especially [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ones. This has led to [[Islamic art]] being dominated by [[Islamic geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], the barely representational foliage patterns of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], and the 'half-formed' figures (e.g. wings without a body) of [[batik|Indonesian art]]; but [[figurative art]] still has a strong tradition, especially on a small scale in private works for the home or palace. The proliferation of photographic and filmed images today has led to controversy, with some religious authorities stating, for example, that all television is un-Islamic, but this is not a widely held position.

==Theological views==
The [[Quran]], the [[Islamic holy books|Islamic holy book]], does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199794133|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|end=92|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|21|51|end=52|s=ns|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the hadith, among a dozen of the hadith recorded during the [[History of Islam|latter part of the period]] when they were being written down. Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner.

Sunni [[Exegesis|exegetes]] or ''[[tafsir]]'', from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious ''[[madhhab]]'' (schools) and marked differences between different [[Islamic schools and branches|branches of Islam]]. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafi]]s and [[Wahhabi]]s (which are also often [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements within Islam]]. [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sufism|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism. On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith, and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a problematic issue, discussed by early [[Theology|theologians]], as to how to describe [[God]], Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. God is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[Names of God in Islam|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds recorded in the biographies known as ''[[Prophetic biography|Sirah Rasul Allah]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

[[Titus Burckhardt]] sums up the role of aniconism in Islamic aesthetics as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of icons in Islam has not merely a negative but a positive role. By excluding all anthropomorphic images, at least within the religious realm, Islamic art aids man to be entirely himself. Instead of projecting his soul outside himself, he can remain in his ontological centre where he is both the viceregent (''khalîfa'') and slave ('''abd'') of God. Islamic art as a whole aims at creating an ambience which helps man to realize his primordial dignity; it therefore avoids everything that could be an 'idol', even in a relative and provisional manner. Nothing must stand between man and the invisible presence of God. Thus Islamic art creates a void; it eliminates in fact all the turmoil and passionate suggestions of the world, and in their stead creates an order that expresses equilibrium, serenity and peace.&lt;ref name="Burckhardt1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Titus Burckhardt|title=Mirror of the intellect: essays on traditional science &amp; sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K9ELNioz18C|accessdate=12 December 2011|date=1 October 1987|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-684-9|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In practice==

=== Religious core ===
In practice, the core of normative religion in Islam is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the Quran or the white dress of [[pilgrim]]s entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion (mysticism, popular piety, private level) exhibit in this regard significant variability. Aniconism in secular contexts is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking, aniconism in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts. In the past, it was enforced only in some times and places.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The representation of living beings in Islamic art is not just a modern phenomenon or because of current technology, Westernization or the [[cult of personality|cult of the personality]].

[[File:Pisa-Opera del Duomo-Grifone islamico000.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pisa Griffin]], probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andalus]], is the largest Islamic figurative sculpture to survive.]]
The avoidance of idolatry is the main concern of the restrictions on images, and the traditional form for religious cult image, the free-standing sculpture, is extremely rare, and there are no large examples of humans. The [[Pisa Griffin]], of a [[Legendary creature|mythical beast]] and designed to spout water for a fountain, is the largest example, at three feet tall in bronze, and probably only survives because it was taken as booty by the city of [[Pisa]] in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false Mack, p. 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125727/https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false |date=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the [[Alhambra]], it probably came from [[Al-Andalus]], one of the more relaxed Arabic-speaking regions in this respect. The [[griffin]] and lions cannot easily be regarded as potential idols, given their submissive position (and the lack of religions worshipping lions or griffins), and the same is true of small decorative figures in relief on objects in metalwork, or figures painted on [[Islamic pottery]], both of which are relatively common. In particular [[hunting]] scenes of humans and animals were popular, and presumably regarded as clearly having no religious function. The figures in miniatures were, until the late 16th century, always numerous in each image, small (typically only an inch or two high), and showing the central figures at roughly the same size as the attendants and servants who are usually also shown, thus deflecting potential accusations of idolatry. The books illustrated were most often the classics of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and historical [[chronicle]]s.

The hadith show some concessions for context, as with the dolls, and condemn most strongly the makers rather than the owners of images. A long tradition of prefaces to ''[[muraqqa]]s'' sought to justify the creation of images without getting involved in discussions of the specific texts, using arguments such as comparing God to an artist.

Miniature painting was mostly patronized by the court circle and is a private form of art; the owner chooses who to show a book or ''muraqqa'' (album). But wall-paintings with large figures were found in early Islam, and in Safavid and later Persia, especially from the 17th century, but were always rare in the Arabic-speaking world. Such paintings are also mainly found in private palaces; examples in public buildings are rare though not unknown, in [[Iran]] there are even some in mosques.

In Islamic sacred architecture, ornamentation consists mainly in arabesques and [[geometry|geometrical]] patterns.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Mosques do not feature dynamic elements, but aim for a quality of serenity and repose.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Similarly, weight-bearing elements are not designed along [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] lines to present an image of physical strength; [[cupola]]s for example often feature [[muqarnas]] disguising the transition between the cupola and its supports, creating the impression that the supports, rather than holding up the cupola, have "congealed" from the divine void above.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Titus Burckhardt]] |title=The Void in Islamic Art |journal=Studies in Comparative Religion |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1970 |url=http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050237/http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized by noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;See '[[Sura]]' and 'Taswir' in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.

Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images. TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins, in streets and offices (e.g. presidents like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafez al-Assad|al-Assad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries ([[Saddam Hussein]]'s are infamous&lt;ref&gt;[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html David Zucchino "U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue" ''Honolulu Advertiser'', July 5, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192226/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as art schools training sculptors and painters. In the [[Egypt]]ian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mecca on the walls of their houses.

The [[Taliban]] movement in [[Afghanistan]] banned photography and destroyed non-Muslim artifacts, especially carvings and statues such as the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], generally tolerated by other Muslims, on the grounds that the artifacts are idolatrous or ''[[shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''. However, sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of Talibans from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Lee Anderson]], [[Thomas Dworzak]], ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9542648-5-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For Shia communities, portraits of the major figures of Shiite history are important elements of religious devotion. In Iran, portraits of Muhammad and of [[Ali]], printed on pieces of cloth or woven into carpets, are called ''temsal'' ("likenesses") and can be bought around shrines and in the streets, to be hung in homes or carried with oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dabashi|first=Hamid|title=Shi'ism - A Religion of Protest|year=2011|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] portraits of Ali can be found on notoriously ornate trucks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm Saudi Aramco World : Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008035126/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm |date=October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; buses and rickshaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ The Rickshaw Arts of Bangladesh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021211125/http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ |date=October 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the Sunni tradition, a photographic picture of the deceased can be placed on the Shiite tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml Picture of Golestan e Shohoda cemetery Esfahan -Esfahan, Iran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075410/http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html Mashad Martyrs Cemetery at Best Iran Travel.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407170105/http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html |date=April 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A curiosity in Iran is an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] photography supposed to represent Muhammad as a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;Photography by Lehnert &amp; Landrock, titled "Mohamed", Tunis, c. 1906.

[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature painting from the 16th century, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
Medieval Muslim artists found various ways to represent especially sensitive figures such as Muhammad. He is sometimes shown with a fiery [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] hiding his face, head, or whole body, and from about 1500 is often shown with a veiled face. Members of his immediate family and other prophets may be treated in the same way. More generally, it can be believed that since God is absolute, the act of depiction is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two cannot be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-737929@51-735567,0.html LeMonde.fr : JEAN-FRANÇOIS CLÉMENT « Cette affaire de caricatures participe d'une mentalité de «victimisation» » des musulmans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, symbolising the severing of the soul, and clarifying the fact that it is not something alive and imbued with a soul that is depicted: a purposeful flaw to make what is depicted impossible to live in reality (as merely impossible in reality is still often frowned upon or banned, such as representations of comic book characters or unicorns, although exceptions do exist). Calligraphy, the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, has also its figurative side due to anthropo- and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] [[Islamic calligraphy#Calligrams|calligrams]]. Few portraits were attempted, and the ability to create recognisable portraits was rare in Islamic art until the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] tradition began in the late 15th century, although in both Mughal India and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey portraits of the ruler then became very popular in court circles.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|left|A [[hilya]] or description in calligraphy of the appearance of [[Muhammad]] by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]] (d. 1698).]]
Forms of Islamic calligraphy evolved, especially in the Ottoman period, to fulfill a function similar to that of representative art by means of calligraphic representation, when on paper usually with elaborate frames of [[Ottoman illumination]]. These include the name of Muhammad, the ''[[hilya]]'', or description of his physical appearance, similar treatments of one or more of the names of God in Islam, and the ''[[tughra]]'', a calligraphic version of the name of an Ottoman [[sultan]].

==Causes==

===Hadith and exegesis examples===

During its early days, aniconism in Islam was intended as a measure against idolatry, particularly against the statues worshipped by [[Paganism|pagans]]. All hadith presented in this section are Sunni, not Shia.

{{Quote|Narrated [[Aisha]]:&lt;br&gt;(the [[Muhammad's wives|wife of the Prophet]]) I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When [[Allah]]'s Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] have I committed?' Allah's Apostle said. "What is this cushion?" I said, "I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it." Allah's Apostle said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished on the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]], and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' " The Prophet added, "The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)."|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|318}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She replied: My dolls. Among them he saw a horse with wings made of rags, and asked: What is this I see among them? She replied: A horse. He asked: What is this that it has on it?

They invited him, and when he came he put his hands on the side-ports of the door, but when he saw the figured curtain which had been put at the end of the house, he went away. So Fatimah said to Ali: Follow him and see what turned him back. I (Ali) followed him and asked: What turned you back, Apostle of Allah? He replied: It is not fitting for me or for any Prophet to enter a house which is decorated.|Abu Dawood|''Sunan Abu Dawood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|27|3746}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle returned from a journey when I had placed a curtain of mine having pictures over (the door of) a chamber of mine. When Allah's Apostle saw it, he tore it and said, "The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who try to make the like of Allah's creations." So we turned it (i.e., the curtain) into one or two cushions.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|838}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To show the superiority of the [[Monotheism|monotheist]] faith, Muhammad smashed the idols at the [[Kaaba]]. He also removed paintings that were [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemous to Islam]], while protecting others (the images of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and Jesus) inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.

{{Quote|Narrated [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]]:&lt;br&gt;When Allah's Apostle arrived in Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba while there were idols in it. So he ordered that they be taken out. The pictures of the (Prophets) Abraham and [[Ishmael]], holding arrows of divination in their hands, were carried out. The Prophet said, "May Allah ruin them (i.e. the [[infidel]]s) for they knew very well that they (i.e. Abraham and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]) never drew lots by these (divination arrows). Then the Prophet entered the Ka'ba and said. "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" in all its directions and came out and not offer any prayer therein.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|584}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Muslim b. Subaih reported: I was with Masriuq in the house which had the portrayals of Mary ([[hadrat]] [[Mary in Islam|Maryan]]). Thereupon Masriuq said: These are portraits of Kisra. I said: No, these are of Mary. Masruq said: I heard [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah b, Mas'ud]] as saying Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said: The most grievously tormented people on the Day of Resurrection would be the painters of pictures. (Muslim said): I read this before Nasr b. 'Ali at-Jahdami and he read it before other narrators, the last one being Ibn Sa'id b Abl at Hasan that a person came to Ibn 'Abbas and said: I am the person who paints pictures; give me a religious verdict about them. He (Ibn 'Abbas) said to him: Come near me (still further). He came near him so much so that he placed his hand upon his head and said: I am going to narrate to yor what I heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I heard him say: All the painters who make pictures would be in the fire of [[Hell]]. The soul will be breathed in every picture prepared by him and it shall punish him in the Hell, and he (Ibn 'Abbas) said: If you have to do it at all, then paint the pictures of trees and lifeless things; and Nasr b. 'Ali confirmed it.|[[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]]|''[[Sahih Muslim]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although [[Arabian mythology|pagans in Muhammad's times]] also worshiped trees and stones, Muhammad opposed only images of animated beings — humans and animals —, as reported by the hadith. Subsequently, geometrical ornamentation became a sophisticated art form in Islam.

{{Quote|Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:&lt;br&gt;While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|father of 'Abbas]]! My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures." Ibn 'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|428}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: We had a curtain with us which had portraits of birds upon it. Whenever a visitor came, he found them in front of him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: Change them, for whenever I enter the room) I see them and it brings to my mind (the pleasures) of worldly life. She said: We had with us a sheet which had silk badges upon it and we used to wear it. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn Muthanna but with this addition: 'Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not command us to tear that."|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me. and I had a shelf with a thin cloth curtain hangin. over it and on which there were portraits. No sooner did he see it than he tore it and the colour of his face underwent a change and he said: A'isha, the most grievous torment from the Hand of Allah on the Day of Resurrection would be for those who imitate (Allah) in the act of His creation. A'isha said: We tore it into pieces and made a cushion or two cushions out of that.|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5261}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad also warned his followers of dying amongst people that built places of worship at graves and placed pictures in it (i.e. [[Christian]]s).
{{Quote| Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;When the Prophet became ill, some of his wives talked about a [[Church (building)|church]] which they had seen in [[Ethiopia]] and it was called Mariya. [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya|Um Salma]] and [[Ramla bint Abi Sufyan|Um Habiba]] had been to Ethiopia, and both of them narrated its (the Church's) beauty and the pictures it contained. The Prophet raised his head and said, "Those are the people who, whenever a pious man dies amongst them, make a place of worship at his grave and then they make those pictures in it. Those are the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|2|23|425}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad made it very clear that [[angel]]s do not like pictures.
{{Quote|Narrated [[Ali ibn Abi Talha|Abu Talha]]:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle said, "[[Islamic view of angels|Angels]] (of mercy) do not enter a house where there are pictures.'" The sub-narrator Busr added: "Then [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zaid]] fell ill and we paid him a visit. Behold! There was, hanging at his door, a curtain decorated with a picture. I said to 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani, the step son of [[Maymuna bint al-Harith|Maimuna]], the wife of the Prophet, "Didn't Zaid tell us about the picture the day before yesterday?" 'Ubaidullah said, "Didn't you hear him saying: 'except a design in a garment'?"|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|841}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Salim's father:&lt;br&gt;Once [[Gabriel]] promised to visit the Prophet but he delayed and the Prophet got worried about that. At last he came out and found [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]] and complained to him of his grief (for his delay). Gabriel said to him, "We do not enter a place in which there is a picture or a dog."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|843}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, there are hadith stating that Muhammad permitted dolls belonging to both his wife and daughter in his own house.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Comparison with Judaism and Christianity==

[[Judaism]], which is related to Islam as a monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Mūsa]]), and other prophets, has a [[Idolatry in Judaism|comparable prohibition]] which takes the form of a prohibition on any [[Cult image|idol]] or on any artistic representation of [[God in Judaism|God]]. The third of the three related religions, [[Christianity]], actively practiced aniconism in the [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]], in the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected [[Beeldenstorm|all images in churches]]. But it has generally had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures, and the movement of iconoclasm was at no time supported by the Roman papacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Babs Reingold''' (born in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]) is an American contemporary interdisciplinary artist working with sculpture, [[Installation art|installation]], video, painting and drawing. She currently lives and works in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and maintains a studio in [[New York City]].

==Art==
Reingold is best known as a visual and [[conceptual artist]] for creating alternate ambiguities with her wall art and installations as they relate to the environment, poverty and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 Babs Reingold, 2010 Fellow in Visual Art, Pinellas County, Florida Division of Cultural Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017025132/http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She draws on her early experiences of hardship to create elaborate installations using domestic objects and natural materials like clotheslines, threads, human hair, animal skins, [[organza]] fabric structures, rust and tea staining, and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamics of the environment, power, technology, and the manipulation and destruction of nature are recurring themes in her art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drawingcenter.org/viewingprogram/share_portfolio.cfm?pf=1013 Babs Reingold’s Drawing Center entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Her installation ''The Last Tree'' portrays the world's 193 countries with fabricated silk organza tree stumps stuffed with human hair in pails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iseny.org/usr_helio1/index.php Babs Reingold: The Last Tree curated by Midori Yoshimoto, Ph.D at the ISE Cultural Center, NY]&lt;/ref&gt; This elaborate installation, curated by Midori Yoshimoto at the ISE Cultural Foundation in New York, illuminates [[Jared Diamond]]'s question ''What was the Easter Islander thinking when he chopped down the last tree?'' resulting in a culture that demolished the entire wealth of its natural resources. A second show of the traveling exhibit was at the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 2016-2017. Recent museum showings were at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in 2015-2016.

==Personal life==
After spending her childhood in Caracas, and youth in [[Dallas, Texas]], Reingold endured grinding poverty as an adolescent in Woodhill, a public housing complex in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with her mother and four siblings after her photographer father became ill with [[multiple sclerosis]] and her mother was unable to cope,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cltampa.com/tampa/babs-reingolds-unsettling-vision-of-lives-traumatized-by-poverty/Content?oid=2035505#.UUS5eaWj4Rw Babs Reingold's unsettling vision of lives traumatized by poverty by Megan Voeller]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://local-artists.org/user/4883/cv Babs Reingold and the illusion of reality]&lt;/ref&gt; Reingold later escaped the cycle of poverty to become a successful artist. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (BFA) degree from the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]], and obtained a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]].

==Museum collections==
Reingold's works of art can be found in numerous public and private collections around the world, and are included in the permanent collections of the [[Newark Museum of Art]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; and the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], among others.

[[UNESCO]]'s '''City of Literature''' programme is part of a wider [[Creative Cities Network]] which was launched in 2004 and is currently made up of 180 UNESCO Creative Cities globally. Members are drawn from 72 countries and cover seven creative fields: Crafts &amp; Folk Art, Design, Film, Gastronomy, Literature, Music, and Media Arts.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/about-creative-cities/ UNESCO What is the Creative Cities Network?]&lt;/ref&gt; The Network was born out of UNESCO's Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity initiative which was created in 2002. The Creative City Network’s aim is to "promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world." The cities in the network promote their local creative scene and conform to UNESCO’s goal of fostering cultural diversity. They recognise past, present and future: a strong cultural heritage, a vibrant and diverse contemporary cultural scene, and aspirations to extend culture to the next generation at home and to other cities in a global partnership.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"/&gt; {{As of|2017}}, 28 cities have been designated as part of the City of Literature programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macdonald |first=Moira |date=31 October 2017 |title=UNESCO declares Seattle a City of Literature |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/unesco-declares-seattle-a-city-of-literature/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Cities of Literature network of 28 cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofliterature.com/international-cities-of-literature/how-it-began/ How It Began]&lt;/ref&gt; represents 6 continents and 23 countries, and a combined population of over 26 million.

==Criteria for Cities of Literature==
To be approved as a City of Literature, cities need to meet a number of criteria set by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/literature/ Do you have what it takes to be a City of Literature?]&lt;/ref&gt; Designated UNESCO Cities of Literature share similar characteristics:
*Quality, quantity and diversity of publishing in the city
*Quality and quantity of educational programmes focusing on domestic or foreign literature at primary, secondary and tertiary levels
*Literature, drama and/or poetry playing an important role in the city
*Hosting literary events and festivals which promote domestic and foreign literature; 
*Existence of libraries, bookstores and public or private cultural centres which preserve, promote and disseminate domestic and foreign literature
*Involvement by the publishing sector in translating literary works from diverse national languages and foreign literature
*Active involvement of traditional and new media in promoting literature and strengthening the market for literary products.

Cities submit bids to UNESCO to be designated a City of Literature.  The designations are monitored and reviewed every four years by UNESCO.

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.5|"The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all "the ends of the world are come," and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea." The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' described by [[Walter Pater]]]]

'''Ekphrasis''' or '''ecphrasis''',  comes from the Greek for the description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical exercise,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers Dictionary'', Chambers Harrap, Edinburgh 1993 {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in the adjectival form '''ekphrastic''', is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a [[Visual arts|visual work of art]], either real or imagined. In [[Classical antiquity|ancient times]], it referred to a description of any thing, person, or [[experience]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκ ''ek'' and φράσις ''phrásis'', 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν ''ekphrázein'', "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name".

According to the [[Poetry Foundation]], "an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art."&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry Foundation, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/glossary-term/ekphrasis Glossary Terms: Ekphrasis] (accessed 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an ekphrastic poem is a poem inspired or stimulated by a work of art.

Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a [[rhetorical device]] in which one medium of [[art]] tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its [[essence]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness.
A descriptive work of [[prose]] or [[poetry]], a [[film]], or even a [[photograph]] may thus highlight through its ''rhetorical'' vividness what is happening, or what is shown in, say, any of the [[visual art]]s, and in doing so, may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. One example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is "telling the story of" the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. Virtually any type of [[artistic media|artistic medium]] may be the actor of, or subject of ekphrasis. One may not always be able, for example, to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way; yet if it's the spirit of the book that we are more concerned about, it certainly can be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through [[synergy]].

In this way, a painting may represent a sculpture, and vice versa; a poem portray a picture; a sculpture depict a heroine of a novel; in fact, given the right circumstances, any art may describe any other art, especially if a ''rhetorical element'', standing for the sentiments of the artist when she/he created her/his work, is present. For instance, the distorted faces in a crowd in a painting depicting an original work of art, a sullen countenance on the face of a sculpture representing a historical figure, or a film showing particularly dark aspects of neo-Gothic architecture, are all examples of ekphrasis.

== History ==

=== Plato's forms, the beginning of ekphrasis ===
In the ''Republic'', Book X, Plato discusses [[substantial form|forms]] by using real things, such as a [[bed]], for example, and calls each way a bed has been made, a "bedness". He commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect [[archetype]] or image in the form of which beds ought to be made, in short, the [[epitome]] of bedness.

In his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness – with all its shortcomings – with that of the ideal form, or template. A third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. He continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever-present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. As bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an "infinite regress of forms".

=== From form to ekphrasis ===
It was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage.

Artists began to use their own literary and artistic [[genre]] of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===
For [[Plato]] (and [[Aristotle]]), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines ''bedness'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~jjacobs1/utpictura/1.htm|title=Ecphrasis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[mimesis|mimetic]] stages at which beds may be viewed that defines ''bedness.'' 
# a bed as a physical entity is a mere form of bed
# any view from whichever perspective, be it a side elevation, a full panoramic view from above, or looking at a bed end-on is at a second remove
# a full picture, characterising the whole bed is at a third remove
# ekphrasis of a bed in another art form is at a fourth remove

=== Socrates and Phaedrus ===
In another instance, [[Socrates]] talks about ekphrasis to [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] thus:&lt;br /&gt;
"You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing,
which makes it truly correspond to painting.&lt;br /&gt;
The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive,&lt;br /&gt;
but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the same with written words; they seem to talk&lt;br /&gt;
to you as if they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything&lt;br /&gt;
about what they say, from a desire to be instructed,&lt;br /&gt;
they go on telling you just the same thing forever".&lt;ref&gt;Plato: ''Phaedrus'' 275d&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==

=== In literature ===

The fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in [[Philostratus III|Philostratus of Lemnos]]' ''Eikones'' which describes 64 pictures in a Neapolitan villa.  Ekphrasis is described in [[Aelius Festus Aphthonius|Aphthonius]]' ''[[Progymnasmata]]'', his [[textbook]] of [[style guide|style]], and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques was keenly revived in the Renaissance.

In the Middle Ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially as regards real objects, and historians of [[medieval art]] have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of [[relic]]s, and rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the [[iconography]].

The [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods made much use of ekphrasis. In Renaissance Italy, Canto 33 of [[Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' describes a picture gallery created by Merlin. In Spain, [[Lope de Vega]] often used allusions and descriptions of Italian art in his plays, and included the painter [[Titian]] as one of his characters. [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] also incorporated works of art in dramas such as ''The Painter of his Dishonor''. [[Cervantes]], who spent his youth in Italy, utilized many Renaissance frescoes and paintings in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and many of his other works. In England, [[Shakespeare]] briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in [[Cymbeline]], but his most extended exercise is a 200-line description of the Greek army before Troy in [[The Rape of Lucrece]]. Ekphrasis seems to have been less common in France during these periods.

Instances of ekphrasis in [[19th century literature]] can be found in the works of such influential figures as Spanish novelist [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], French poet, painter and novelist [[Théophile Gautier]], Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]], and Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

[[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby Dick]], or The Whale'' features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. In the chapter "The Spouter Inn", a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler's inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. The narrator, so-called Ishmael, describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a Whale, which grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how Melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter.

In Pérez Galdós's ''Our Friend Manso'' (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]] to point to the shipwreck of ideals; while in  ''La incógnita'' (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of Italian art, including references to [[Botticelli]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Masaccio]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], etc.

In [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s 1888 work ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex-lover returning to her.  Both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist Ellida Wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead.  Furthermore, as an interesting example of the back-and-forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]] painted an image similar to the one described by Ibsen in a painting he entitled (unsurprisingly enough) ''Lady from the Sea''.  Ibsen's last work [[When We Dead Awaken]] also contains examples of ekphrasis as the play's protagonist, Arnold Rubek, is a sculptor who several times throughout the play describes his masterpiece "Resurrection Day" at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation.  Once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by Rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression Ibsen's own plays took as many scholars have read this final play (stated by Ibsen himself to be an 'epilogue') as the playwright's reflection on his own work as an artist.

The Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''.  In this novel, the protagonist, Prince Myshkin, sees a painting of a dead Christ in the house of Rogozhin that has a profound effect on him.  Later in the novel, another character, Hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of Christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine.  Rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man's faith, a comment that Dostoyevsky himself made to his wife Anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, ''[[The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]].  The painting was seen shortly before Dostoyevsky began the novel.  Though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when Prince Myshkin sees a painting of Swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in Switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, Nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait.  At one point in the novel, Nastasya, too, describes a painting of Christ, her own imaginary work that portrays Christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead Christ.

The Irish aesthete and novelist [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890/1891) tells how Basil Hallward paints a picture of the young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. Under his sway, Dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. He would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. As Dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. There are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait's imagery to the imagination. The novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. Wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in [[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]] (1889).

[[Anthony Powell]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' begins with an evocation of the painting by [[Poussin]] which [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|gives the sequence its name]], and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.

In the 20th century, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s "[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]" uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of [[Hokusai]]'s famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story.

==== Ekphrastic poetry ====
[[File:Angelo monticelli shield-of-achilles.jpg|thumb|This is a design of the Shield of Achilles based on the description in the Iliad. It was completed by Angelo Monticelli c. 1820. This shield represents the art of Ekphrastic poetry Homer used in his writings.]]
Ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of [[Homer]] whose [[Iliad]] (Book 18) describes the [[Shield of Achilles]], with how [[Hephaestus]] made it as well as its completed shape.&lt;ref name="writingaboutart"&gt;Munsterberg, Marjorie, Writing About Art: [http://writingaboutart.org/pages/ekphrasis.html Ekphrasis] (retrieved 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Famous later examples include [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] when he describes what [[Aeneas]] sees engraved on the doors of [[Carthage]]'s temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and [[Catullus 64]], which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of [[Ariadne]] picked out on it.

Ekphrastic poetry flourished in the [[romanticism|Romantic]] era and again among the [[pre-Raphaelite]] poets. A major poem of the English Romantics – [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]]— provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. The entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds immensely evocative. [[Felicia Hemans]] made extensive use of ekphrasis &lt;ref&gt;Grant F. Scott. ''The Fragile Image: Felicia Hemans and Romantic Ekphrasis'' in ''Felicia Hemans. Reimagining Poetry in the Nineteenth Century''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-333-80109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as did [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], especially in her ''Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures''. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s "double-works" exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. Rossetti also ekphrasised a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='For "Our Lady of the Rocks", by Leonardo da Vinci'|url=http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/5-1848.raw.html|website=Rossetti Archive|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include [[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]]'s 1892 volume ''Sight and Song'', which contains only ekphrastic poetry; [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s poem 'Before the Mirror', which ekphrasises [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s [[Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl]], hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, "Verses Written under a Picture"; and [[Robert Browning]]'s [[My Last Duchess]], which although a [[dramatic monologue]], includes some description by the Duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand.

Ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practised. Twentieth-century examples include [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s "Archaïscher Torso Apollos",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/gr/Rilke.html|title=Rainer Maria Rilke, Torso of an Archaic Apollo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1952), a poem by [[W.H. Auden]],&lt;ref name="writingaboutart" /&gt; which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in Homer (see above), where [[Thetis]] finds very different scenes from those she expects. In contrast, his earlier poem ''[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]'' describes a particular real and very famous painting ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', thought until recently to be by rather than after [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], which is also described in the poem by [[William Carlos Williams]] ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}

=== In, or as, art history ===

Since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual Greek or Roman art, an approach full of risk. This is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to "paint a picture".  Many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate.

This tendency is by no means restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in ''[[Beowulf]]'' are eventually always mentioned by writers on [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and compared to the treasures of [[Sutton Hoo]] and the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. The ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]] (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record.  The inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise.

Journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by [[Denis Diderot]] in his long pieces on the works in the [[Paris Salon]], and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most Western countries.  Since few if any of the works could be illustrated description and evocation was necessary, and the cruelty of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style.

As [[art history]] began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, exphrasis as [[formal analysis]] of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject, and by no means all examples lack attractiveness as literature.  Writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in English [[John Ruskin]], both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and [[Walter Pater]], above all for his famous evocation of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', are among the most notable.  As photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images was even perhaps increased.

Ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Homer and other classical examples were certainly an inspiration for the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or [[silver-gilt]], crowded with complicated scenes in [[relief]], that were produced in 16th century [[Mannerist]] metalwork.

=== In music ===

There are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a [[suite (music)|suite]] in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for [[piano]] by the Russian composer [[Modest Mussorgsky]] in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. The suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified.

The first movement of ''[[Three Places in New England]]'' by [[Charles Ives]] is an ekphrasis of the [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]] in Boston, sculpted by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Scott|title=Orchestral Set No. 1: Three Places in New England – Notes|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Ives/WK_OS_1_Three_Places.htm|work=A Charles Ives Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachmaninoff]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' is a musical evocation of [[Böcklin]]'s [[Isle of the Dead (painting)|painting of the same name]]. [[King Crimson]]'s song "[[Starless and Bible Black|The Night Watch]]", with lyrics written by [[Richard Palmer-James]], is an ekphrasis on [[Rembrandt]]'s painting ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

=== Notional ekphrasis ===

Notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. It may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. The expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. Finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non-existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality.

== In ancient literature ==


=== Greek literature ===

==== ''The Iliad'' ====

The [[shield of Achilles]] is described by Homer in a famous example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. The shield contains images representative of the [[Cosmos]] and the inevitable fate of the city of Troy. The shield of Achilles features the following nine depictions:
# The Earth, Sea, Sky, Moon and the Cosmos (484–89)
# Two cities – one where a wedding and a trial are taking place, and one that is considered to be Troy, due to the battle occurring inside the city (509–40)
# A field that is being ploughed (541–49)

==== ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'' ====

Although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609–614 the belt of [[Heracles|Herakles]] is described as having "marvelous works,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Odyssey of Homer|last=Lattimore|first=Richmond|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|year=1967|location=New York|at=lines 609–614}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. It also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. In ''the Odyssey,'' there is also a scene where Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, Penelope, that he has proof that Odysseus is still alive. She asks him about the clothes Odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted Odysseus. Homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of Odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''The Argonautika'' ====

The Cloak of Jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. In ''[[Argonautica|The Argonautika]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodios|first1=Apollonios|title=The Argonautika|at=lines 720–763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's cloak has seven events embroidered into it:

# The forging of Zeus' thunderbolts by the Cyclops (730-734)
# The building of Thebes by the sons of Antiope (735–741)
# Aphrodite with the shield of Ares (742–745)
# The battle between Teleboans and the Sons of Electryon (746–751)
# Pelops winning Hippodameia (752–758)
# Apollo punishing Tityos (759–762)
# Phrixus and the Ram (763–765)

The description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled off of Homer's writing, but alludes to several occurrences in Homer's epics ''the Iliad'' and ''the Odyssey''. Jason's cloak can be examined in many ways. The way the cloak's events are described is similar to the catalogue of Women that Odysseus encounters on his trip to the Underworld.&lt;ref name="University of Berkeley, California"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulloch|first1=Anthony|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=www.academia.edu|page=59|url=https://www.academia.edu/367874/Jasons_Cloak|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares Jason to future heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. Jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to Odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to Ithaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association (1974-)|date=1 January 1980|volume=110|pages=263–286|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason also bears similarities to Achilles; by donning the cloak, Jason is represented as an Achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of Achilles. He is also takes up a spear given to him by Atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|date=1993|publisher=The University of California Press|page=120|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with Hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that Jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. Through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, Apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the Roman people, and that Jason should learn to live by. Such virtues include the piety represented by the Cyclops during the forging of Zeus' thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association |date=1 January 1980|volume=110|page=265|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reminiscent of the scene in ''the Iliad'' when Thetis goes to see Hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son Achilles. Before he began creating the shield and armor, Hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on Jason's cloak we see the Cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|page=122|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman literature ===

==== ''The Aeneid'' ====

''[[Aeneid|The Aeneid]]'' is an epic that was written by Virgil during the reign of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. While the epic itself mimics Homer's works, it can be seen as propaganda for Augustus and the new Roman empire.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. D.|date=1981|title=The Shield of Aeneas|jstor=41591854|journal=Vergilius|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield of Aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629–719.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shield was given to him by his mother, Venus, after she asked her husband Vulcan to create it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aeneid of Virgil|last=Ahl|first=Frederick|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-923195-9|location=Great Britain|at=lines 372–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is almost identical to Thetis, the mother of Achilles, asking Hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of Troy.

The difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of Achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for Aeneas depicts the future that Rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the Emperor Augustus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events:

# The She Wolf and the suckling Romulus and Remus (629–634)
# The Rape of the Sabine Women (635–639)
# Mettius pulled apart by horses (640–645)
# Invasion of Lars Parsona (646–651)
# Manlius guarding the capitol (652–654)
# Gauls invading Rome (655–665)
# Tartarus with Cato and Catiline (666–670)
# The Sea around the width of the shield (671–674)
# The Battle of Actium (675–677)
# Augustus and Agrippa (678–684)
# Antony and Cleopatra (685–695)
# Triumph (696–719)

There is speculation as to why Virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain Roman values that would have been of high importance to the Roman people and to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classicsvic.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/penwillvol18.pdf|title=Reading Aeneas' Shield|last=Penwill|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values may include ''virtus, clementia, iustitia'', and ''pietas'', which were the values inscribed on a shield given to Augustus by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=S. J.|date=November 1997|title=The Survival and Supremacy of Rome: The Unity of the Shield of Aeneas|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8428342&amp;fileId=S0075435800058081|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instance of ekphrasitc poetry maybe Virgil's attempt to relate more of his work to Augustus.

Earlier in the epic, when Aeneas travels to Carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. Like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. Out of these, there are eight images related to the Trojan War:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Depictions of Agamemnon and Menelaus, Priam and Achilles (459)
# Greeks running from Trojan soldiers (468)
# The sacking of the tents of Rhesus and the Thracians, and their deaths by Diomedes (468–472)
# Troilus being thrown from his Chariot as he flees from Achilles (473–478)
# The women of Troy in lamentation, praying to the gods to help them (479–482)
# Achilles selling Hektor's body (483–487)
# Priam begging for the return of his son, with the Trojan commanders nearby (483–488)
# Penthesilea the Amazon, and her fighters (489–493)

==== ''The Metamorphoses'' ====

There are several examples of ekphrasis in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; one in which Phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father Phoebus. When Phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamorphoses|last=Martin|first=Charles|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The seas that circle the Earth, the surrounding lands, and the sky (8–9)
# The gods of the sea and the Nymphs (10–19)
# Scenes of men, beasts, and local gods (20–21)
# Twelve figures of the Zodiac, six on each side of the door to the temple (22–23)

== Other aspects ==

=== Educational value of using ekphrasis in teaching literature ===

The rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized for example, the student's emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. The literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Joseph O'Beirne, and Lucy Floyd Morcock Milner. Bridging English. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice, 1999. pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student's brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. Using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of [[higher order thinking]] skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.

'''Elisabeth Thuillier''' (fl. 1890s-1920s) was a French colourist who ran a workshop in Paris where her employees [[Film colorization#Hand colorization|hand-coloured]] early films and photographic slides using her plans and colour choices. She is remembered especially for the work she did for the director [[Georges Méliès]].

== Colourist ==
Thuillier had experience in colouring slides for [[magic lantern]]s, and in other kinds of photographic and colour work. Her workforce had started colouring film by 1897.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; This cinematic work was still new and it was given last place in the following description of her exhibit for the Paris ''[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]'' in 1900. Its length reflects the importance of Thuillier's business.&lt;ref name=Toulet&gt;{{citation|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5446181q/f8.image|language=French|first=Emmanuelle|last=Toulet|title=Le cinéma à l'Exposition universelle de 1900|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|volume=XXXIII|date=April 1986|pages=182–183|quote=Couleurs et coloris. Matières premières colorantes. Photographies négatives et positives, sur papier, sur verre, sur soie, sur cuir, sur parchemin celluloïd. Épreuves stéréoscopiques sur verres, et vues à projections en couleurs. Photochromie et photographies artistiques en couleurs. Coloris de films pour cinématographe.|jstor=20529217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Colours and colouring. Raw materials for tinting. Negative and positive photographs, on paper, on glass, on silk, on leather, on celluloid parchment. Stereoscopic prints on glass, coloured slides. Photochromy and artistic colour photographs. Film colouring for cinematography.''&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Exposition'' jury awarded her a bronze medal.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;

Thuillier hired more than 200 employees, all women, to handle the film commissions her workshop undertook. In a 1929 interview, she recollected spending her nights selecting colours and trying out samples.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Thuillier described her colours for film as "fine" [[aniline dye]]s, creating transparent and luminous tones. These dyes were dissolved first in water and then in alcohol. Each colourist was assigned a single tone, tinting specific parts of each frame before passing the film on to the next worker, in [[assembly line]] fashion.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Some areas to be coloured were so small that a paintbrush containing only a single horsehair was used.&lt;ref name=Kizirian/&gt;

Thuillier and her workers probably used four basic dyes: orange, a cyan-like blue-green, magenta, and bright yellow. These could be mixed to create other colours. The tones produced also changed depending the shade of grey of the film underneath.&lt;ref name=Essai&gt;{{citation|chapter=Avertissement|last1=Malthête-Méliès|first1=Madeleine|last2=Quévrain|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Malthête|first3=Jacques|pages=5–11|title=Essai de reconstitution du catalogue français de la Star-Film; suivi d'une analyse catalographique des films de Georges Méliès recensés en France|location=Bois d'Arcy|publisher=Service des archives du film du Centre national de la cinématographie|year=1981|isbn=2903053073|oclc=10506429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films used more than twenty distinct colours, and all the work was done by hand.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{citation|first=François|last=Mazeline|journal=L'Ami du Peuple|date=13 December 1929|title=Mme Thullier nous rappelle… le temps où le cinéma ne manquait pas de couleurs}}.

According to Thuillier's recollections, her studio typically produced about 60 coloured copies of each film they took on. For 300 metres of hand-coloured film, the cost was about 6 or 7 thousand francs per copy.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

== Clients ==
[[File:Trip to the Moon Selenite on Shell.jpg|thumb|Restoration of original hand-coloured frame from Méliès' ''Trip to the Moon'']]
Thuillier handled all colouring work on Méliès' films from 1897 to 1912.&lt;ref name=Yumibe/&gt; Thuillier's work on Méliès's films was international; for example, the American distribution company [[Selig Polyscope]] negotiated with Méliès to have its prints shipped to France to be coloured by Thuillier's workers.&lt;ref name=Kizirian&gt;{{citation|title=The Color of Silents|first=Shari|last=Kizirian|work=Keyframe|publisher=[[Fandor.com]]|url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/the-color-of-silents|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her business was also used by [[Pathé]], but she called off an agreement to work exclusively for them when she realised she would have to share authority with a Mme. Florimond whose husband was a key employee there.&lt;ref name=Yumibe&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|title=Moving Color: Early Film, Mass Culture, Modernism|location=New Brunswick, NJ|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2012|pages=84, 166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpvymkXtt1AC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another customer was experimental film-maker [[Raoul Grimoin-Sanson]].&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

The pioneering director [[Segundo de Chomón]] was not a client but was introduced to Thuillier's techniques of hand-colouring through his wife [[Julienne Mathieu]]. Mathieu (Mme. Chaumont or Chomón) had worked in the Thuillier workshop, as a supervisor according to some sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.larevuedesressources.org/des-tresors-de-films-dans-le-domaine-public-europa-film-treasures,2479.html|title=Des trésors de films dans le domaine public. Europa Film Treasures|work=La Revue des Ressources|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as acting in silent movies. Chomón soon moved on to adding colour with stencils.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

== Later life ==
Thuillier's hand-painting proved to be a slow, expensive way of colouring reels of film, and the world of cinema moved towards using stencils instead of freehand colouring; this was more efficient for multiple copies.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|chapter=French Film Colorists|editor-first1=Jane|editor-last1=Gaines|editor-first2=Radha|editor-last2=Vatsal|editor-first3=Monica|editor-last3=Dall'Asta|title=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, Columbia University Libraries|year=2013|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/essay/french-film-colorists|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last client for Thuillier's colouring techniques was [[Georges Dufayel]],&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; whose impressive department store ''Grands Magasins Dufayel'' housed a cinema and other attractions. In her 1929 interview, Thuillier expressed regrets about the disappearance of her craft.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

In December 1929, she was invited to a gala given in Méliès' honour at [[Salle Pleyel]].&lt;ref name=Melies/&gt; Several films were shown, including ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. For this event, "extremely delicate" colour restoration work was undertaken by two of Thuillier's "pupils", according to ''Cinéa'' magazine. Since the original negatives had been destroyed, the women removed the colour from old positive copies of the films, made new negatives, then new positives, and re-coloured those.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=L'Activité cinégraphique|journal=Cinéa|date=15 December 1929|page=26|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5739062d/f25.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thuillier remarked to the press that if she had had sufficient time, she would have done the work herself.)&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Méliès introduced her in his speech at the gala as an "eminent artist" who did her work with a "remarkable talent".&lt;ref name=Melies&gt;{{citation|first=Georges|last=Mélies|title=Allocution au gala Méliès|date=October 1982|journal=Les dossiers de la cinémathèque|pages=34–36|url=http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/articles/allocution-au-gala-melies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience applauded and called "bravo".&lt;ref name=mage&gt;{{citation|first1=Maurice|last1=Bessy|first2=Lo|last2=Duca|title=Georges Méliès, mage|location=Paris|publisher=Prisma|year=1945|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Thuillier's non-professional life. On her business letterheads she was Mme. B. Thuillier,&lt;ref name=Images/&gt; and was described as a widow around 1900.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt; In the 1920s she withdrew from Paris to "the provinces".&lt;ref name=mage/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3719">[[Image:Emily Pelloe.jpg|thumb|right|Emily Pelloe dressed for the 1929 Centenary Ball, Perth]]
'''Emily Harriet Pelloe''' (3 May 1878 – 15 April 1941) was a [[botanical illustrator]], and author of books, of the flowering plants of [[Western Australia]]. Her work in [[watercolour]], extensive illustrations, and English language descriptions were included in a number of publications on the flora of the State.

==Biography==
[[Image:Caladenia.PlateI.jpg|thumb|''Caladenia''&lt;br&gt;Plate 1 from ''West Australian Orchids'']]Emily Sims was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], later moving to [[Perth, Western Australia]] where she married a banker, Theodore Parker Pelloe, in 1902.  An early interest in equestrian sports was replaced with an interest in botany in 1916. In 1920 she wrote for ''[[The West Australian]]'', in a column 'Women's Interests' as 'Ixia', and contributed to such organisations as the [[Country Women's Association]], a writers club, and continued her interest with horse riding.

She began to paint and publish a large number of watercolours, her landscapes were also acquired by government departments. She collaborated with the state botanist, [[Charles Gardner|C. A. Gardner]], in producing her books, and was included in [[Hal Colebatch]]'s ''A Story of a Hundred Years: Western Australia, 1829–1929''.

Aside from a number of paintings and illustrations, her most noted works are ''Wildflowers of Western Australia'' in 1921 and ''West Australian Orchids'' in 1930.  These publications were intended to be accessible by amateur naturalists and enthusiasts, the scientific descriptions were accompanied with more 'subjective' exposition. The specimens are carefully illustrated, painted, and described, yet her ''Drosera'' and ''Cephalotus'' were presented as "bloodthirsty savages of plant life". The books were popular and commended.

Several publications were issued as ''Wildflowers Of Western Australia'', another so-titled (1936) by the state's Tourist &amp; Publicity Bureau was by Gardner, with a painting by Emily Pelloe. Another was published in 1941  by  Gardner; 'localities and flowering seasons, by Emily H. Pelloe'.
These shorter publications were for the promotion and celebration of the states flora, and similar works continued to be produced as supplements in the West Australian newspaper for many years.

==Legacy==
Her career was abbreviated by ill health and she died while riding a horse in 1941.
The large collection of paintings by Emily Pelloe was presented to the [[University of Western Australia]] in a ceremony the following year. The gift was made by her husband and received by the Governor of the State, Sir [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]], who gave a eulogy. The collection of over 400 paintings is housed at St. Catherine's College, and within the department of botany.

A number of such titles have been published as attempts at satire or polemic, to some commercial success. 

The joke is that "nothing" is the answer to whatever the title of the book asserts. In 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the trend of publishing political empty books had led to "the noble art of political [[parody]] [descending] into a one-joke turn that avoids words".&lt;ref name="KeanSatire" /&gt;

'''''For the Love of God''''' is a sculpture by artist [[Damien Hirst]] produced in 2007. It consists of a [[platinum]] cast of an 18th-century human skull encrusted with 8,601 flawless diamonds, including a pear-shaped pink diamond located in the forehead that is known as the Skull Star Diamond. The skull's teeth are original, and were purchased by Hirst in London. The artwork is a ''[[memento mori]]'', or reminder of the mortality of the viewer.

In 2007, art historian Rudi Fuchs, described the work as "out of this world, celestial almost. It proclaims victory over decay. At the same time it represents death as something infinitely more relentless. Compared to the tearful sadness of a vanitas scene, the diamond skull is glory itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.wired.com/2011/01/for-the-love-of-god-its-damien-hirst/|work = Wired|first = Bruce|last = Sterling|title = For the Love of God, it's Damien Hirst|date = 17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costing £14 million to produce, the work was placed on its inaugural display at the [[White Cube]] gallery in [[London]] in an exhibition ''Beyond Belief'', with an asking price of £50 million. This would have been the highest price ever paid for a single work by a living artist.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hirst unveils £50m diamond skull |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6712015.stm |work=BBC News Online |agency=[[BBC News]] |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=1 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base for the work is a human skull bought in a shop in [[Islington]]. It is thought to be that of a 35-year-old European who lived between 1720 and 1810.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The work's title was supposedly inspired by Hirst's mother, who once asked, "For the love of God, what are you going to do next?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/magazine/03Style-skull-t.html |title=The Iceman Cometh |last=Shaw |first=William |date=3 June 2007 |publisher=[[The New York Times|NYT]] ||accessdate= 1 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the forehead lies a pear-shaped pink diamond, the centrepiece of the work.

Hirst stated the idea for the work came from an [[Aztec]] [[turquoise]] skull at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; However, artist [[John LeKay]], a friend of Hirst's in the early 1990s, said the work is based on a skull covered with [[crystal]]s which LeKay had made in 1993. LeKay said, "When I heard he was doing it, I felt like I was being punched in the gut. When I saw the image online, I felt that a part of me was in the piece.

On 1 June 2007, ''For the Love of God'' went on display in an illuminated glass case in a darkened room on the top floor of the [[White Cube]] gallery in [[St James's]], [[London]]&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dorment/&gt; with heavy security.&lt;ref name="BBC video"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6710000/newsid_6712200?redirect=6712245.stm&amp;news=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;bbram=1 BBC news report], retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 11 June 2007 that the singer [[George Michael]] and his partner [[Kenny Goss]] were interested in purchasing the piece for around £50 million.&lt;ref name="Yahoo Music"&gt;[http://uk.news.launch.yahoo.com/dyna/article.html?a=/11062007/344/george-eyes-50m-diamond-skull.html&amp;e=l_news_dm, Yahoo!

During November–December 2008, Hirst exhibited the diamond skull at the historic [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], amidst public controversy. The skull was exhibited next to an exhibition of paintings from the collection of the museum that were selected and curated by Hirst. According to Wim Pijbes, the museum director, there wasn't controversy amongst the board members. He explained that the exhibition "will attract people—and give a new aspect to the image of the Rijksmuseum as well. It boosts our image. Of course, we do the Old Masters but we are not a 'yesterday institution'. It's for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way." A Belgian journalist in response remarked how the installation of the diamond skull at the Rijks was "an intentionally quite controversial project".

''For the Love of God'' was also displayed in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence, Italy,  and at [[Tate Modern]], London between 4 April 2012 and 25 June 2012.

The work was displayed at Hirst's first solo exhibition in the Middle East, at the Relics Exhibition of [[Doha, Qatar]] from 10 October 2013 to 22 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Relics Exhibition: Diamond Skull Artwork {{cite web |url=http://www.damienhirstqatar.qa/en/diamond-skull-artwork |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103031842/http://www.damienhirstqatar.qa/en/diamond-skull-artwork |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 16 September and 15 November 2015 the skull was displayed at [[Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art]] in Oslo, Norway. &lt;ref&gt;http://afmuseet.no/en/utstillinger/2015/damien-hirst&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale==

[[File:Damien-Hirst-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Damien Hirst]], the creator of the work, was part of the consortium which bought it.]]

Hirst said that the work was sold on 30 August 2007, for £50 million, to an anonymous consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ciar | last = Byrne | title = Hirst's glittering price tag loses none of its shine | publisher = The Independent | date = 31 August 2007 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/hirsts-glittering-price-tag-loses-none-of-its-shine-463675.html | accessdate = 21 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Ruiz, editor of ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', claims that Hirst had failed to find a buyer and had been trying to offload the skull for £38 million.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;Owen, Glen and Dunbar, Polly.  ''Daily Mail'', 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after these allegations were made, Hirst claimed he had sold it for the full asking price, in cash, leaving no paper trail. The consortium that bought the piece included Hirst himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evening Standard]] ''The avant gardener'' 19 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6 February 2012 issue of Time Magazine, Hirst elaborated, in his "10 Questions" interview: "In the end I covered my fabrication and a few other costs by selling a third of it to an investment group, who are anonymous."

[[Harry Levy]], vice chairman of the London Diamond Bourse and Club, said "I would estimate the true worth of the skull as somewhere between £7 million and £10 million."&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; Her Majesty's [[Revenue and Customs]] would expect £8.5 million in VAT payments, if Hirst really did receive £50 million.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; [[David Lee (art critic)|David Lee]], editor of ''The Jackdaw'', commented "Everyone in the art world knows Hirst hasn't sold the skull. It's clearly just an elaborate ruse to drum up publicity and rewrite the book value of all his other work."&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;

==Media reporting and reviews==

The media coverage of the "sale" of the diamond skull was extensive and led some to question to what extent the announcement of the sale was some kind of media art, especially as the "sale" continues to be in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Robert | last = Preece | title = Why I love Damien's skull | publisher = [[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]] | date = January–February 2008 | url = http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Damien-Hirst-diamond-skull-For-the-love-of-God-Robert-Preece-2008 | accessdate = 1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further supported by the performative nature of the Sotheby's exhibition and auction of Hirst's artwork the following year.

In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Germaine Greer]] said, "Damien Hirst is a brand, because the art form of the 21st century is marketing. To develop so strong a brand on so conspicuously threadbare a rationale is hugely creative - revolutionary even."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Germaine | last = Greer | title = Germaine Greer Note to Robert Hughes: Bob, dear, Damien Hirst is just one of many artists you don't get | publisher = The Guardian | date = 22 September 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/22/1 | accessdate = 1 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dorment, art critic of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', wrote: "If anyone but Hirst had made this curious object, we would be struck by its vulgarity. It looks like the kind of thing [[Asprey]] or [[Harrods]] might sell to credulous visitors from the [[oil states]] with unlimited amounts of money to spend, little taste, and no knowledge of art. I can imagine it gracing the drawing room of some African dictator or Colombian drug baron. But not just anyone made it - Hirst did. Knowing this, we look at it in a different way and realise that in the most brutal, direct way possible, ''For the Love of God'' questions something about the morality of art and money."&lt;ref name=dorment/&gt;

Ralph Rugoff of the Hayward Gallery in London criticised the work as a mere decorative object, saying "It's not challenging or fresh. It's a decorative object which is not particularly well done."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/hirsts-16350m-skull-its-no-more-than-a-decorative-object-793122.html Hirst's £50m skull? It's no more than a 'decorative object'  (The Independent, March 8, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Preece, an art critic of [[Sculpture (magazine)|''Sculpture'' magazine]], wrote of the Sotheby's sales of Hirst's work: "I am not concerned with the details of these sales. What matters to me is that they were ''announced''—unleashed, picked up, printed, reprinted, accelerated, translated, and multiplied across global media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Preece | last = Robert | title = Rock star on tour: Damien Hirst's skull at the Rijksmuseum | publisher = [[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]] | date = March 2008 | url = http://www.artdesigncafe.com/rock-star-on-tour-Damien-Hirst-Rijksmuseum-Marc-Quinn-Kate-Moss-British-Museum | accessdate = 1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performative nature of Hirst's work was later addressed in the exhibition at Tate Modern, "Pop Life: Art in a material world," which critic Ben Lewis found very offensive: "... the gallery texts have the temerity to claim that the greed-fuelled auction sale was a work of performance art in itself. That’s just the same as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen#11 September attacks|Stockhausen calling 9/11 a work of art]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ben | last = Lewis | title = Pop Life sells its soul for the big bucks | publisher = London Evening Standard | date = 1 October 2009 | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/review-23751332-pop-life-sells-its-soul-for-the-big-bucks.do | accessdate = 1 January 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091005002814/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/review-23751332-pop-life-sells-its-soul-for-the-big-bucks.do | archivedate = 5 October 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic responses==
In June and July 2007 Polish artist [[Peter Fuss]] presented his work "For the laugh of God" at the exhibitions in [[Gdańsk]] and [[London]] parodying Damien Hirst's For the love of God. The work was a plastic human skull covered in "artificial diamonds".&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterfuss.com/forthelaughofgod/ Peter Fuss, ''For the laugh of God'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A photo of the work thrown out with rubbish bags outside the White Cube gallery was a spoof by artist [[Laura Keeble]]&lt;ref name="Laura Keeble"&gt;[http://www.laurakeeble.com/forgotten-something Laura Keeble "Forgotten Something?"]&lt;/ref&gt; who created a replica skull with 6522 [[Swarovski crystals]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawlings, Ashley.

In 2008, the Gaelic-language publisher [[Ùr-sgeul]] published a short story by [[Maoilios Caimbeul]], "An Claigeann aig Damien Hirst" ("Damian Hirst's Skull"), as a fictional response to the work of art.  This in turn was followed in 2009, by a single performed by the Gaelic rock band, [[Na Gathan]], ''Claigeann Damien Hirst'' (Damian Hirst's Skull), released by Ùr-sgeul, which was inspired by Caimbeul's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nos-ur.eu/pressmedia.html Nòs-ùr competition website], retrieved 16-4-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The song was shortlisted in the Nòs-ùr contest for a new song in a Celtic language or Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Full points not Nil point for Sunrise Not Secular. ''Stornoway Gazette'' (16-4-09)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 Hirst threatened to sue the artist [[Cartrain]] for copyright infringement. Cartrain had incorporated photos of ''For the Love of God'' into collages and sold them on the Internet.&lt;ref name=preece&gt;Preece, Robert. (June 2009).

In 2009, Spanish artist [[Eugenio Merino]] unveiled a piece entitled ''"4 The Love of Go(l)d"'', a giant sculpture, encased in glass, of Hirst shooting himself in the head. Merino, in fact an admirer of Hirst, intended the piece as a comment on the emphasis on money within the art world, and with Hirst in particular. "I thought that, given that he thinks so much about money, his next work could be that he shot himself," said Merino. "Like that the value of his work would increase dramatically...Obviously, though, he would not be around to enjoy it."&lt;ref name="merino"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/18/damien-hirst-suicide-sculpture-eugenio-moreno|title='Suicide' sculpture of Damien Hirst causes controversy in Spain|accessdate=18 February 2009|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Giles | last=Tremlett | date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The piece appears in the second episode of the American-Japanese animated television series ''[[Neo Yokio]]'', when it is possessed by a demon at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sarabia |first1=Luke |title=‘Neo Yokio’’s deadpan elegance may prove inaccessible to Netflix viewers {{!}} The McGill Tribune |url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/a-e/neo-yokios-deadpan-elegance-may-prove-inaccessible-to-netflix-viewers-10112017/ |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=The McGill Tribune |date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skull that looks similar to ''For the Love of God'' serves as the driving force in the video game ''[[50 Cent: Blood on the Sand]]''.

The '''Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media''' is a non-profit research organization that researches gender representation in media and advocates for equal representation of women. Madeline Di Nonno joined as CEO of the Institute in 2009. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is currently headquartered at [[Mount St. Mary's University (Los Angeles)|Mount St. Mary’s University]], in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Geena Davis at the podium (9922450166).jpg|thumb|The founder Hollywood actress Geena Davis in a speech at the [[Millennium Development Goals]] Countdown event in the [[Ford Foundation Building]] in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film (24 September 2013)]]
After watching children’s TV with her young daughter, [[Geena Davis]] noticed that the large majority of television shows lacked a large amount of female characters. This inspired her to think critically about what American media showed to young children; and to eventually investigate the role of gender in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/geena-davis-institute-on-gender-and-media-feminism-1201610886/|title=Geena Davis Makes Women the Center of Attention With Her Institute|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-10-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She realized the importance of the female representation in children’s shows, as these representations can impact how young girls see themselves. &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarasotamagazine.com/articles/2017/2/13/geena-davis-gender-quality|title=Geena Davis Is On a Mission for Gender Equality in the Media|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Davis wanted to focus on television shows, films, and other media outlets that are intended for children under 11, as these are formative years for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children’s television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.&lt;ref&gt; Marechal, AJ. “Davis Institute Tracks Gender Gaps in Media.” Salem State University , 23 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis studied "[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|122 G, PG, and PG-13 films]] theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org1"&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/full-study-gender-disparity-in-family-films-v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, she found that “only 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,” and these women are more sexualized than the men.&lt;ref name="seejane.org1"/&gt; As “children are engaging with media up to 7-10 hours/day,” the representation of women in children’s television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.
At its core, the Geena Davis Institute believes that, too often, the media “sidelines, hypersexualizes, or simply omits” women, particularly in movies and television.&lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt;

Geena Davis was motivated to start her foundation because of her Academy Award Nominated role in [[Ridley Scott|Ridley Scott’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Thelma &amp; Louise|Thelma and Louise]], the 1991 film that she had said changed her life. When the film was released to overwhelming acclaim it made her realize just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to establish her institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/06/how-geena-davis-became-a-champion-for-women-on-screen|title=How Geena Davis became a champion for women on screen|last=Spring|first=Alexandra|date=2017-03-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis said that throughout her career she consciously chose roles that would empower women and girls. She acknowledges that this was a luxury because she “hasn’t run out of money yet” and added that if she ever appeared as [[Sean Connery]]’s comatose wife, “about right, by Hollywood standards” - we should know she’s broke.

== Mission ==
Davis says the Institute targets the entertainment industry rather than the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seeks to increase diversity in casting and advocates for equal representation of women in media.  For example, Davis cited research by the Institute that 17% of people in crowd scenes are women.  Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/geena-davis-on-fighting-for-more-roles-for-women.html|title=Geena Davis on Fighting for Female Representation in Hollywood and the Golden Age of Roles for Women|last=Hunt|first=Stacey Wilson|work=[[Vulture.com]]|date=2016-05-04|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/mar/19/geena-davis--sexism-wasnt-present-in-what-w-show-kids|title=Geena Davis: 'I just assumed sexism wasn't present in what we show kids'|last=O'Conor|first=Lottie|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry.  The Institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/geena-davis-study-press-release.|title=Geena Davis study press release|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Davis’ thoughts about the Gender Gap ==
Davis states, “The fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood’s sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, “Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40’s. If you look at [[IMDb|IMDB,]] up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40’s, I made one movie, [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little.]]” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/158839-the-geena-davis-institute-is-helping-women-in-hollywood-but-not-all-of-them.|title=Geena Davis Is Fighting For Women In Hollywood|last=Atkinson|first=S.|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research impact ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years.

The Institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for-profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Institute, along with the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]], established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/geena-davis-institute-tv-acad-unveil-kid-s-award-1118025704/|title=Geena Davis Institute, TV Acad unveil kid’s award|last=Levine|first=Stuart|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2010-10-14|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current partnerships ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the Institute has partnered with Ford and several [[YouTube]] stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured [[Taryn Southern]], Yulin Kang, and [[Clara Chung|Clara C]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/geena-davis-partners-with-ford-to-fight-unconscious-gender-bias-in-media-its-a-hugely-important-cause-36389|title=Geena Davis Partners With Ford For #ShesGotDrive|first=Jordana|last=Lipsitz|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks “to fight unconscious gender bias in media.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The Institute has also teamed up with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts of the United States of America]] (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls’ Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/geena-davis-institute-and-ford-teamed-up-for-this-inspiring-video-series-promoting-gender-equality/|title=Geena Davis Institute and Ford Teamed Up for This Inspiring Video Series Promoting Gender Equality|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from [[Google]]. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the Institute’s research of on-screen gender disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/movies/geena-davis-inclusion-quotient-research.html|title=How Long Is an Actress Onscreen?

In addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute’s goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the [[United Nations]]; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fccfoundation.org/press-release/academy-award-winning-actor-and-activist-geena-davis-to-speak-at-fund-for-women-and-girls-luncheon-april-9/|title=Academy Award-winning actor and activist Geena Davis to speak at Fund for Women and Girls luncheon April 9 - Fairfield County's Community Foundation|work=Fairfield County's Community Foundation|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant studies ==
The Institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from [[2008 in film|2008]] and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/|title=Research Informs &amp; Empowers - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt; Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public’s attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of [[2014 in film|2014]] and [[2015 in film|2015]] and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films. &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/data/|title=Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study also found that “women had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,” and cites women like [[Tina Fey]] and [[Melissa McCarthy]] as a couple of the year’s leading ladies.&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt; Yet even with female leads like Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only “11% featured a female lead.”&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;  Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, “films led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;

In 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in movies than ever before. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/gender-equality-initiative-reframe/|title=Major Hollywood Execs Launch Campaign to End Gender Inequality|website=ScreenCrush|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like [[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]] and [[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]], both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of young girls participating in archery greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/hitting-the-bullseye-reel-girl-archers-inspire-real-girl-archers-short.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, “68% of the film companies they’ve worked with have changed two or more of their projects” to include more female representation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleking/2017/04/03/geena-davis-is-creating-opportunities-for-women-in-hollywood-by-tackling-gender-bias/4/#496be8474b71|title=Geena Davis Is Creating Opportunities For Women In Hollywood By Tackling Gender Bias|first=Michelle|last=King|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bentonville Film Festival ==
In addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the [[Bentonville Film Festival]] with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/bentonville-film-festival-to-offer-more-diversity-in-2016-says-geena-davis-1201579283/|title=Bentonville Film Festival to Offer More Diversity in 2016, Says Geena Davis|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-08-27|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yearly festival is held in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], Arkansas.Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival.The festival also has concerts with various artists each year.

'''''Il dio serpente''''' (The snake god) is a [[List of Italian films of 1970|1970]] [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[erotic film|erotic]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Piero Vivarelli]] and featuring Italian-based American actress [[Nadia Cassini]] in her first lead role. The film is an earlier example of [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (and later [[zombie]]) themed [[sexploitation film]]s shot in the [[Dominican Republic]] by Italian directors. The theme song of the film, "Djamballà" by [[Augusto Martelli]], reached the first position in the Italian hit parade.&lt;ref name=hitparade&gt;{{cite book|last=Dario Salvatori|title=Storia dell'Hit Parade|publisher=Gramese, 1989|isbn=8876054391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paola (Cassini) is in a deteriorating marriage with Bernard ([[Galeazzo Bentivoglio]]). After the couple move to an island in the [[Caribbean]], Paola befriends a local woman named Stella ([[Beryl Cunningham]]) who introduces her to the cult of the serpent god Djamballà. Paola, first despising the rituals of the cult, soon realises that they represent the passion and lust lacking in her married life. At a ritual where reality is interspersed within fantasy, Paola has sex with a strong black man ([[Evaristo Márquez]]) she identifies with the serpent god himself. After her husband's sudden death, she invites her former lover Tony ([[Sergio Tramonti]]) to the island to start a new life but understands that Djamballà has become her sole obsession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14307">[[File:Knight of the Swan P1010741 straightened contrasted.JPG|thumb|A tapestry of 1482 showing episodes from the Knight of the Swan story: At the bottom puppies are substituted for babies.]]

The story of the '''Knight of the Swan''', or '''Swan Knight''', is a [[Medieval poetry|medieval]] [[Epic poetry|tale]] about a mysterious rescuer who comes in a [[swan]]-drawn boat to defend a [[Damsel in distress|damsel]], his only condition being that he must never be asked his name.

The earliest versions (preserved in ''Dolopathos'') do not provide specific identity to this knight, but the Old French [[Crusade cycle]] of ''[[chansons de geste]]'' adopted it to make the Swan Knight (''Le Chevalier au Cigne'', first version around 1192) the legendary ancestor of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]. The ''Chevalier au Cigne'', also known as '''Helias''', figures as the son of Orient of L'Islefort (or Illefort) and his wife Beatrix in perhaps the most familiar version, which is the one adopted for the late fourteenth century [[Middle English]] ''[[Chevalere Assigne|Cheuelere Assigne]]''.&lt;ref name=gibbs-i&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1868|pp=i-ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's mother's name may vary from Elioxe (probably a mere echo of Helias) to Beatrix depending on the text, and in a Spanish version, she is called Isomberte.

At a later time, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] incorporated the swan knight '''[[Lohengrin|Loherangrin]]''' into his [[Arthurian]] epic ''[[Parzival]]'' (first quarter of the 13th century). A German text, written by [[Konrad von Würzburg]] in 1257, also featured a Swan Knight without a name. Wolfram's and Konrad's were used to construct the libretto for [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' (Weimar 1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jaffray|1910|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the motif is Brangemuer, the knight that lay dead in a boat tugged by a swan, and whose adventure was taken up by Gawain's brother Guerrehet ([[Gareth]] or [[Gaheris]]) in the first Continuation to [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]''.

==Swan Children==
The "Swan-Children" appears to have been originally separate from the Godfrey cycle and the Swan Knight story generally.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239/&gt; Paris identifies four groups of variants, which he classifies usually by the name of the mother of the swan children.
&lt;ref name=Hibbard240&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale in all variants resemble not only such [[chivalric romance]]s as ''[[The Man of Law's Tale]]'' and ''[[Emaré]]'', but such fairy tales as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]''.{{r|schlauch}} It also bears resemblance to the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}

===Dolopathos===
Included in Johannes de Alta Silva's ''Dolopathos sive de Rege et Septem Sapientibus'' (ca. 1190), a Latin version of the ''[[Seven Sages of Rome]]'' is a story of the swan children which has served as a precursor to the poems of the [[Crusade cycle]].&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.lxxxxi-&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was adapted into the French ''Li romans de Dolopathos'' by the poet Herbert.&lt;ref name=gerritsen&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerritsen|Van Melle|1998}}, ''Dictionary of Medieval Heroes'', reprinted 2000, pp.247 "Seven Sages of Rome"&lt;/ref&gt; The story is as follows:&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hibbard240-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nameless young lord becomes lost in the hunt for a [[white stag]] and wanders into an [[enchanted forest]] where he encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace. They fall instantly for each other and consummate their love. The young lord brings her to his castle, and the maiden (just as she has foretold) gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan “''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).”&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;

===Crusade cycle: ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne''===
The Knight of the Swan story appears in the Old French ''[[chansons de geste]]'' of the first [[Crusade cycle]], establishing a legendary  ancestry of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who in 1099 became ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Godfrey loomed large in the medieval Christian imagination, and his shadowy genealogy became a popular subject for writers of the period.

The swan-children tale occurs in the first or ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne'' branch of the [[Literary cycle|cycle]]. The texts can be classed into four versions, 1) ''Elioxe'', 2) ''Beatrix'', 3) an Elioxe-Beatrix composite, and 4) Isomberte.  Of ''Isomberte'' no French copy survives, and it's known only from the Spanish ''Gran conquista de Ultramar''.&lt;ref name="elioxe-intro-OFCC"/&gt;  
([[Gaston Paris]] also used a somewhat similar classification scheme for swan-children cognate tales which he refers to as Version I.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239 /&gt;)

[[File:Helias 2.gif|thumb|Helias, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (16th-century)]]

'''Elioxe''' follows the ''Dolopathos'' tale closest, but tells a courtlier version of the story,&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.xciii-&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the young lord who becomes lost with King Lothair, a ruler from beyond [[Hungary]] and the maiden with Elioxe. Lothair loses his way and stops by a fountain, and while asleep, is tended by Elioxe who comes out of the woodworks of the mountains. King Lothair decides to wed her, despite his mother's protest. However Elioxe foretells her own death giving birth to seven children, and that one of the offspring shall be king of the Orient.

While Lothair is absent warring, the queen mother Matrosilie orders a servant to carry the children in two baskets and expose them in the forest, and prepares the lie that their mother gave birth to serpents and died from their bites. The servant however had left the children by the hermit's hut, so they survive, and seven years later are discovered by a greedy courtier named Rudemart. Allured by the gold chains the children are wearing, he obtains instruction from the queen mother to steal them, but failing to take account of their numbers, misses the chain belonging to the girl. The six boys bereft of the chains fly out in swan form, and their father Lothair issues an order of protection. The king's nephew tries to hunt one of the birds to please him, but the king in a fit hurls a gold basin which breaks. Matrosilie then provides one of the necklaces to make the repair. Eventually the truth is untangled through the sister of the swan siblings. All the boys regain human form but one. While other seek their own fortunes, one boy cannot part with his brother turned permanently into a swan, and becomes Swan Knight.&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC/&gt;

In the '''Beatrix''' variants, the woman had taunted another woman over her alleged adultery, citing a [[multiple birth]] as proof of it, and was then punished with a multiple birth of her own.&lt;ref name="hibbard242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Beatrix versions, the mother is also an avenging justice.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80–1}} In the '''Isomberte''' variants, the woman is a princess fleeing a hated marriage.&lt;ref  name="hibbard242"/&gt;

==Swan Knight==
Version II involves the Swan Knight himself. These stories are sometimes attached to the story of the Swan Children, but sometimes appear independently, in which case no explanation of the swan is given. All of these describe a knight who appears with a swan and rescues a lady; he then disappears after a taboo is broken, but not before becoming the ancestor of an illustrious family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this is merely a brief account to introduce a descendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second version of this tale is thought to have been written by the [[Normans|Norman]] [[trouvère]] [[Jean Renart]].

In [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] the name of the Knight of the Swan is ''Helias''. It has been suggested that this connects him to the Greek solar god, [[Helios]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name is in fact a common variant of the name of the prophet [[Elijah]], who nevertheless was connected to the Greek solar god by orthodox worship because of his association to Mount Horeb and a fire chariot.

[[File:Lohengrin-kitsch.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Lohengrin postcard around 1900 by unknown artist]]

==Lohengrin==
{{main|Lohengrin}}
In the early 13th century, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] adapted the Swan Knight motif for his epic ''[[Parzival]]''. Here the story is attached to Loherangrin, the son of the protagonist Parzival and the queen of Pelapeire Condwiramurs. As in other versions Loherangrin is a knight who arrives in a swan-pulled boat to defend a lady, in this case Elsa of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. They marry, but he must leave when she breaks the taboo of asking his name.

In the late 13th century, the poet Nouhusius (Nouhuwius) adapted and expanded Wolfram's brief story into the romance ''[[Lohengrin]]''. The poet changed the title character's name slightly and added various new elements to the story, tying the Grail and Swan Knight themes into the history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="kalinke"/&gt; In the 15th century an anonymous poet again took up the story for the romance ''Lorengel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalinke|1991|pp=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version omits the taboo against asking about the hero's name and origins, allowing the knight and princess a happy ending.

In 1848, [[Richard Wagner]] adapted the tale into his popular [[opera]] ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', probably the work through which the Swan Knight story is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, Frederick L.

Note: The I is used in two distinct versions in Turkic languages, [[Dotted and dotless I|dotless (I ı) and dotted (İ i)]]. They are considered different letters, and case conversion must take care to preserve the distinction. Note that [[Irish alphabet|Irish]] traditionally does not write the dot, or [[tittle]], over the small letter ''i'', but the language makes no distinction here if a dot is displayed, so no specific encoding and special case conversion rule is needed like for Turkic alphabets.

====Statistics====
The chart above lists a variety of alphabets that do not officially contain all 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. In this list, two letters are used by all of them: A and I. For each of the 26 basic ISO Latin alphabet letters, the number of alphabets in the list above using it is as follows:
{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid"
! Letter

==Letters not contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet==
{{See also|List of Latin-script letters#Extensions|label 1=List of Latin-script letters: Extensions}}
Some languages have extended the Latin alphabet with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], [[diacritic|modified letters]], or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. These symbols are listed below. The characters in the following tables may not all render, depending on which [[operating system]] and [[user agent|browser]] version are used, and the presence or absence of [[Unicode]] [[typeface|fonts]].

===Other letters in collation order===

Note: The tables below are a work in progress. Eventually, table cells with light blue shading will indicate letter forms which do not constitute distinct letters in their associated alphabets. Please help with this task if you have the required linguistic knowledge and technical editing skill.

For the order in which the characters are sorted in each alphabet, see [[Collating sequence]].

===Notes===
# &lt;span id="n-la"&gt;[[#r-la|↑]][[#r-la:1|↑]][[#r-la:2|↑]][[#r-la:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; In classical '''Latin''', the digraphs ''[[ch (digraph)|CH]]'', ''[[ph (digraph)|PH]]'', ''[[rh (digraph)|RH]]'', ''[[th (digraph)|TH]]'' were used in loanwords from [[Greek language|Greek]], but they were not included in the alphabet. The ligatures ''[[Æ]]'', ''[[Œ]]'' and ''[[W]]'', as well as lowercase letters, were added to the alphabet only in [[Middle Ages]]. The letters ''J'' and ''U'' were used as [[typography|typographical variants]] of ''I'' and ''V'', respectively, roughly until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].
# &lt;span id="n-af"&gt;[[#r-af|↑]][[#r-af:1|↑]][[#r-af:2|↑]][[#r-af:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; In '''Afrikaans''', ''C'' and ''Q'' are only (and ''X'' and ''Z'' almost only) used in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-sq"&gt;[[#r-sq|↑]][[#r-sq:1|↑]][[#r-sq:2|↑]][[#r-sq:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Albanian''' officially has the digraphs ''dh, gj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh'', which is sufficient to represent the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect.  The [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] dialect supplements the official alphabet with 6 nasal vowels, namely â, ê, î, ô, û, ŷ.
# &lt;span id="n-aat"&gt;[[#r-aat|↑]][[#r-aat:1|↑]][[#r-aat:2|↑]][[#r-aat:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Arbëresh''' apparently requires the digraphs ''dh, gj, hj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh''.  Arbëresh has the distinctive hj, which is considered as a letter in its own right.
# &lt;span id="n-az"&gt;[[#r-az|↑]][[#r-az:1|↑]][[#r-az:2|↑]][[#r-az:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; A with diaeresis is used only as a replacement character for schwa if the latter cannot be used (it was replaced by the schwa one year later because it is the most common letter). These cases should be avoided!
# &lt;span id="n-eu"&gt;[[#r-eu|↑]][[#r-eu|↑]][[#r-eu:2|↑]][[#r-eu:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Basque''' has several digraphs: ''dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz''.  The ü, which is pronounced as /ø/, is required for various words in its Zuberoan dialect. ''C, Ç, Q, V, W, Y'' are used in foreign words, but are officially considered part of the alphabet (except Ç, which is considered a variant of C).
# &lt;span id="n-bm"&gt;[[#r-bm|↑]] '''Bambara''' also has the digraphs: ''kh''(only present in loanwords), ''sh'' (also written as ''ʃ''; only present in some dialects). Historically, ''è'' was used instead of ''ɛ'', ''ny'' was used instead of ''ɲ'', and ''ò'' was used instead of ''ɔ'' in Mali
# &lt;span id="n-be"&gt;[[#r-be|↑]][[#r-be:1|↑]][[#r-be:2|↑]][[#r-be:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Belarusian''' also has several digraphs: ''ch, dz, dź, dž''.
# &lt;span id="n-bi"&gt;[[#r-bi|↑]][[#r-bi:1|↑]][[#r-bi:2|↑]][[#r-bi:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Bislama''' also has the digraph ''ng''.
# &lt;span id="n-br"&gt;[[#r-br|↑]][[#r-br:1|↑]][[#r-br:2|↑]][[#r-br:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Breton''' also has the digraphs ''ch, c'h, zh''. ''C, Q, X'' are used in foreign words or digraphs only.
# &lt;span id="n-ca"&gt;[[#r-ca:1|↑]][[#r-ca:2|↑]][[#r-ca:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Catalan''' also has a large number of digraphs: ''dj, gu, gü, ig, ix, ll, l·l, ny, qu, qü, rr, ss, tg, tj, ts, tx, tz''. The letters ''K'', ''Ñ'', ''Q'' ''W'', and ''Y'' are only used in loanwords or the digraphs mentioned.
# &lt;span id="n-ch"&gt;[[#r-ch|↑]][[#r-ch:1|↑]][[#r-ch:2|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Chamorro''' also has the digraphs ''ch, ng''. ''C'' used only in digraphs.
# &lt;span id="n-co"&gt;[[#r-co|↑]][[#r-co:1|↑]][[#r-co:2|↑]][[#r-co:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Corsican''' has the trigraphs: ''chj, ghj''.
# &lt;span id="n-hr"&gt;[[#r-hr|↑]][[#r-hr:1|↑]][[#r-hr|↑]][[#r-hr:3|↑]][[#r-sr|↑]][[#r-sr:1|↑]][[#r-sr|↑]][[#r-sr:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Croatian''' also has the digraphs: ''dž'', ''lj'', ''nj''. It can also be written with four tone markers above on top of the vowels. Note that Croatian Latin is the same as Serbian Latin and they both map 1:1 to [[Serbian Cyrillic]], where the three digraphs map to Cyrillic letters ''џ'', ''љ'' and ''њ'', respectively. Rarely and non-standardly, digraph ''dj'' is used instead of ''đ'' (Cyrillic ''ђ'').
# &lt;span id="n-acy"&gt;[[#r-acy|↑]][[#r-acy:1|↑]] &lt;/span&gt; '''Cypriot Arabic''' also has the letters ''Θ'' and ''Δ''.

While'' á, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ť, ú, ů, ''and ''ý'' are considered separate letters, in collation they are treated merely as letters with diacritics. However, ''č, ř, š, ''and ž'' ''are actually sorted as separate letters. ''Q, W, X, Ö'' occur only in loanwords.

''C'' is part of both alphabets and is not used in native Danish or Norwegian words (except some proper names), but occures quite frequently in well-established loanwords in Danish. Norwegian and Danish use é in some words such as ''én'', although é is considered a diacritic mark, while å, æ and ø are letters. ''Q, W, X, Z'' are not used except for names and some foreign words.
# &lt;span id="n-din"&gt;[[#r-din|↑]] '''Dinka''' also has the digraphs: ''dh'', ''nh'', ''ny'', ''th''. ''H'' is only present in these digraphs. Dinka also used the letters Ää, Ëë, Ïï, Öö, Ɛ̈ɛ̈, Ɔ̈ɔ̈ (the last two which do not exist as precomposed characters in Unicode)
# &lt;span id="n-nl"&gt;[[#r-nl:1|↑]][[#r-nl:2|↑]][[#r-nl:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; The status of ''[[IJ (letter)|ij]]'' as a letter, ligature or digraph in '''Dutch''' is disputed. ''C'' (outside the digraph ''ch'') ''Q'', ''X'', and ''Y'' occur mostly in foreign words. Letters with grave and letters with circumflex occur only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-en"&gt;[[#r-en:1|↑]][[#r-en:2|↑]][[#r-en:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''English''' generally now uses extended Latin letters only in loan words, such as fiancé, fiancée, and résumé.  Rare publication guides may still use the dieresis on words, such as "coöperate", rather than the now-more-common "co-operate" (UK) or "cooperate" (US).  For a fuller discussion, see articles branching from [[Lists of English words of international origin]], which was used to determine the diacritics needed for more unambiguous English.  However, an ''é'' or ''è'' is sometimes used in poetry to show that a normally silent vowel is to be pronounced, as in "blessèd".

(The use of the tilde over the two letters is now rare). Only ñ is required for everyday use (only in loanwords). The accented vowels are used in dictionaries to indicate pronunciation, g with tilde is only present in older works.
# &lt;span id="n-fr"&gt;[[#r-fr:1|↑]][[#r-fr:2|↑]][[#r-fr:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; Uppercase diacritics in '''French''' are often (incorrectly) thought of as being optional, but the official rules of French orthography designate accents on uppercase letters as obligatory in most cases. Many pairs or triplets are read as digraphs or trigraphs depending on context, but are not treated as such lexicographically: consonants ''ph, (ng), th, gu/gü, qu, ce, ch/(sh/sch), rh''; vocal vowels ''(ee), ai/ay, ei/ey, eu, au/eau, ou''; nasal vowels ''ain/aim, in/im/ein, un/um/eun, an/am, en/em, om/on''; the half-consonant ''-(i)ll-''; half-consonant and vowel pairs ''oi, oin/ouin, ien, ion''. When rules that govern the French orthography are not observed, they are read as separate letters, or using an approximating phonology of a foreign language for loan words, and there are many exceptions. In addition, most final consonants are mute (including those consonants that are part of feminine, plural, and conjugation endings). Y with diaeresis and U with diaeresis are only used in certain geographical names and proper names plus their derivatives, or, in the case of U with diaeresis, newly proposed reforms. Eg. capharnaüm `shambles' is derived from the proper name Capharnaüm. ''Æ'' occurs only in Latin or Greek loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-ff"&gt;[[#r-ff|↑]] '''Fula''' has ''X'' as part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (used only in loanwords in these countries). ''Ɠ'', which is used only in loanwords (but still part of the alphabet), is used in Guinea only. Fula also uses the digraphs ''mb'' (In Guinea spelled ''nb''), ''nd'', ''ng'', and ''nj''. ''aa'', ''ee'', ''ii'', ''oo'', and ''uu'' are part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. ''Ƴ'' is used in all countries except for Nigeria, where it is written ''('y)''. ''Ŋ'' is used in all countries except for Nigeria. ''Ɲ'' is used in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso, ''Ñ'' is used in Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the digraph ''ny'' is used in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. The apostrophe is a letter (representing the glottal stop) in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
# &lt;span id="n-gl"&gt;[[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Galician'''. The standard of 1982 set also the digraphs ''gu'', ''qu'' (both always before ''e'' and ''i''), ''ch, ll, nh'' and ''rr''. In addition, the standard of 2003 added the grapheme ''ao'' as an alternative writing of ''ó''. Although not marked (or forgotten) in the list of digraphs, they are used to represent the same sound, so the sequence ''ao'' should be considered as a digraph. Note also that ''nh'' represents a [[velar]] nasal (not a [[palatal]] as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) and is restricted only to three feminine words, being either [[demonstrative]] or [[pronoun]]: ''unha'' ('a' and 'one'), ''algunha'' ('some') and ''ningunha'' ('not one'). The Galician ''[[reintegracionismo]]'' movement uses it as in Portuguese.

The [[long s]] ''(ſ)'' was in use until the mid-20th century. ''Sch'' is usually not treated like a true trigraph, neither are ''ch'', ''ck'', ''st'', ''sp'', ''th'', (''ph'', ''rh'')'' and ''qu'' digraphs. ''Q'' only appears in the sequence ''qu'' and in loanwords, while ''x'' and ''y'' are found almost only in loan words. The capital ''ß'' (''ẞ'') is almost never used, ''ß'' is replaced with ''SS'' when writing all-caps. The accented letters (other than the letters ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'', and ''ß'') are used only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-gn"&gt;[[#r-gn|↑]][[#r-gn:1|↑]][[#r-gn:2|↑]][[#r-gn:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Guaraní''' also uses digraphs ''ch, mb, nd, ng, nt, rr'' and the glottal stop '' ' ''. ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are only used in these digraphs.

Textbooks usually use macron or doubled vowel to mark the length, grave to mark the low tone and circumflex to mark the falling tone. Therefore, in some systems, it is possible that macron is used in combination with grave or circumflex over a, e, i, o or u.
# &lt;span id="n-hu"&gt;[[#r-hu|↑]][[#r-hu:1|↑]][[#r-hu:2|↑]][[#r-hu:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Hungarian''' also has the digraphs: ''cs, dz, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs''; and the trigraph: ''dzs''. Letters ''á, é, í, ó, ő, ú, ''and ''ű'' are considered separate letters, but are collated as variants of a, e, i, o, ö, u, and ü.
# &lt;span id="n-ga"&gt;[[#r-ga|↑]][[#r-ga:1|↑]][[#r-ga:2|↑]][[#r-ga:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Irish''' formerly used the dot diacritic in ''ḃ, ċ, ḋ, ḟ, ġ, ṁ, ṗ, ṡ, ṫ''.

''V'' only occurs in onomotopoeia, such as ''vácarnach'', ''vác'', or ''vrác'', or in rare alternative spellings ''víog'' and ''vís'' (usually spelled ''bíog'' and ''bís''), or in loanwords. ''Z'' only occurs in the West Muskerry dialect in the digraph ''zs'' (a rare eclipsis of s, spelled s in other dialects and the language proper) or in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-ig"&gt;[[#r-ig|↑]] '''Igbo''' writes Ṅṅ alternatively as N̄n̄. Igbo has the digraphs: ''ch, gb, gh, gw, kp, kw, nw, ny, sh''. ''C'' is only used in the digraph before. Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone.

X is also used for native words derived from Latin and Greek; J is also used for just a few native words, mainly names of persons (as in Jacopo) or of places (as in [[Jesolo]] and [[Jesi]]), in which is always pronounced as letter I. While it does not occur in ordinary running texts, geographical names on maps are often written only with acute accents. The circumflex is used on an -i ending that was anciently written -ii (or -ji, -ij, -j, etc.) to distinguish homograph plurals and verb forms: e.g. e.g. principî form principi, genî from geni.
# &lt;span id="n-kaa"&gt;[[#r-kaa|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Karakalpak''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, sh''. ''A', G', I', N', O', U''' are considered as letters. ''C, F, V'' are used in foreign words.

''Dz'' and ''dž'' are occasionally considered separate letters of the alphabet in more archaic examples, which have been published as recently as the 1950s; however, modern alphabets and teachings discourage this due to an ongoing effort to set decisive rules for Latvian and eliminate barbaric words accumulated during the Soviet occupation. The digraph "ie" is never considered a separate letter. ''Ō'', ''Ŗ'', and the digraphs ''CH'' (only used in loanwords) and ''UO'' are no longer part of the alphabet, but are still used in certain dialects and newspapers that use the old orthography. ''Y'' is used only in certain dialects and not in the standard language. ''F'' and ''H'' are only used in loanwords.

However, these are not considered separate letters of the alphabet. ''F'', ''H'', and the digraph ''CH'' are only used in loanwords. Demanding publications such as dictionaries, maps, schoolbooks etc need additional diacritical marks to differentiate homographs.Using grave accent on A, E, I, O, U, acute accent on all vowels, and tilde accent on all vowels and on L, M, N and R. Small E and I (also with ogonek) must retain the dot when additional accent mark is added to the character; the use of ì and í (note the missing dot) is considered unacceptable.

The old orthography writes ''ā'' as e in some words, but ā in others; it also writes ''ū'' as i between consonants. The old orthography writes geminates and long vowels as two letters instead. Allophones of {{IPA|/ɘ/}}, written as only e o ō in the new orthography, are also written as i u and very rarely, ū. The letter ''Y'' only occurs in the words ''yokwe'' or the phrase ''yokwe yuk'' (also spelled iakwe iuk in the old orthography or io̧kwe eok in the new orthography).

The letters ''è''and ''ò'' are used in geographical names outside Europe and not part of the language proper. The now abandoned practice was to indicate underlying stress in words ending in -mente -- sòmente, ùltimamente etc. Neither the digraphs nor accented letters are considered part of the alphabet.
# &lt;span id="n-ro"&gt;[[#r-ro|↑]] '''Romanian''' normally uses a [[comma (diacritic)|comma]] diacritic below the letters ''s'' and ''t'' (''ș, ț''), but it is frequently replaced with an attached [[cedilla]] below these letters (''ş, ţ'') due to past lack of standardization.

While cedilla is etymologically Spanish diminutive of ceda (z) and Sancho Pança is the original form in Cervantes books, C with cedilla ''ç'' is now completely displaced by z in contemporary language. In poetry, the diaeresis may be used to break a diphthong into separate vowels. Regarding that usage, Ortografía de la lengua española states that "diaeresis is usually placed over the closed vowel [i.e. 'i' or 'u'] and, when both are closed, generally over the first". In this context, the use of ï is rare, but part of the normative orthography.

W and z are used in some integrated words like [[World Wide Web|webb]] and [[wikt:zone|zon]]. Q, ü, è, and ë are used for names only, but exist in Swedish names. For foreign names ó, ç, ñ and more are sometimes used, but usually not. Swedish has many digraphs and some trigraphs.

# &lt;span id="n-yo"&gt;'''Yoruba''' uses the digraph ''gb''. Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone. Although the "dot below" diacritic is widely used, purists prefer a short vertical underbar (Unicode COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW U+0329) - this resembles the IPA notation for a syllabic consonant, attached to the base of the letter (E, O or S). The seven Yoruba vowels (A, E, E underbar, I, O, O underbar, U) can be uttered in three different tones: high (acute accent); middle (no accent) and low (grave accent). The letters M and N, when written without diacritics, indicate nasalisation of the preceding vowel. M and N also occur as syllabics - in these circumstances, they take acute or grave tonal diacritics, like the vowels. Middle tone is marked with a macron to differentiate it from the unmarked nasalising consonants. A tilde was used in older orthography (still occasionally used) to indicate a double vowel. This is tonally ambiguous, and has now been replaced by showing the paired vowels, each marked with the appropriate tones.
However, where a double vowel has the tonal sequence high-low or low-high, it may optionally be replaced by a single vowel with a circumflex (high-low) or caron (low-high), eg. á + à = â; à + á = ǎ.

'''''Matin à Villeneuve''''', also known as '''''Villeneuve-l'Etang, le matin''''' and '''''From Waters Edge''''', is a painting created circa 1905 in the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] tradition with a strong [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalist]] component by the French artist [[Henri Biva]] (1848–1929). This work was photographed and reproduced as a black and white postcard published for the occasion of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1906 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924101988214/cu31924101988214_djvu.txt Loan exhibition of paintings owned by residents of Rochester: the Memorial Art Gallery (1914), University of Rochester, Book contributor: Cornell University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Henri Biva, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906, Vintage postcard.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Biva]], ca.1905, ''Matin à Villeneuve'', Salon 1906, original postcard, published in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,176011372,var,HBIVAMATIN-A-VILLENEUVESALON-1906cpa-9x14,language,E.html Henri Biva, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906, Vintage postcard]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Matin à Villeneuve'' is an oil painting on canvas in a vertical format with dimensions 153.7 x 127&amp;nbsp;cm (60.5 by 50 in), signed ''Henri Biva'' (lower left).

This highly detailed work depicts a morning scene at the Villeneuve-l'étang park, located just outside Paris in the western suburb of Marnes-la-Coquette (Seine-et-Oise), France. The artist has chosen a quiet section of the park with a view facing towards the east. The greenery suggests the work was painted [[en plein air]] during the months of July or August, and possibly finished some time later in Biva's Parisian [[Artist studio|atelier]].

Unlike works of the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]] or [[Fauvism|Fauves]], in vogue at the time, Biva has gone to great lengths to show even the most minute details of the scene, such as leaves and petals floating on the surface of the water; overlapping blades of grass; superimposed branches and leaves of varying size indicating distance from the observer; reflecting background trees in the rippling body of water; patches of raking sunlit shimmering seemingly at random throughout carefully selected sections of the composition.

This work of skillfully controlled artistry presents a dominant palette of green variously mixed and blended by the artist to form diverse tones, values and hues, contrasted only by the transpiercing light of the morning sky partly visible through the delicate foliage while bouncing off the surface of the shallows.

==Naturalism==
A trace of Biva's meticulous and rigorous professors at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris—Léon Tanzi (1846-1913), an esteemed Realist painter and Alexandre Nozal (1852-1929) a respected landscape artist—can be contemplated in Biva's work.

Janet Whitmore writes of Henri Biva's work, something that could apply to many of his paintings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Like the naturalist painters such as [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] or [[Rosa Bonheur]]", writes Janet Whitmore, "there is a strong tactile quality to Biva’s work, focused on the shapes, colors and forms of the small plants beside the stream or the smooth grey surface of the tree trunks". Equally important, she writes, "this type of landscape painting offered an intimate glimpse of a specific locale, a reminder of days spent in the French countryside, or perhaps at the immense forest preserves surrounding Paris. Unlike contemporaries such as [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] or [[Claude Monet|Monet]], Biva’s landscapes suggest a time before industrialization when no railroad or factory disrupted rural vistas. Rather, these images show no evidence of human activity at all except for the occasional fisherman drowsing by the riverside. (Janet Whitmore, Ph.D.)&lt;ref name="Janet Whitmore"&gt;[http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=2&amp;artist=2710&amp;bio=1 Janet Whitmore, Ph.D., a biography of Henri Biva] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105085202/http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=2&amp;artist=2710&amp;bio=1 |date=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Spiro Wulfing and Etowah repousse plates HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Plates from [[Wulfing cache|Malden]], [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]]]]

'''Mississippian copper plates''', or plaques, are plain and [[Repoussé and chasing|repousséd]] plates of beaten [[copper]] crafted by peoples of the various regional expressions of the [[Mississippian culture]] between 800 and 1600 CE.  They have been found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. The plates, found as far afield as Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. Some of the more notable examples are representations of [[Bird of prey|raptorial birds]] and avian-themed dancing warriors.

==Copper in the Eastern Woodlands==
[[File:Anishanabe1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Diorama of [[Anishinaabe]] people mining copper near [[Lake Superior]]]]
Copper trade routes throughout the [[Eastern Woodlands]] were established during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] (3000 - 1000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 28-9&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into historic times.&lt;ref name="Broseet"&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 149&lt;/ref&gt; Copper was usually imported from the [[Great Lakes]] region; however other sources of copper have been found elsewhere including in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the Etowah Site in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 184&lt;/ref&gt;

For generations the [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Indigenous peoples of North America]] pursued copper sources and transmitted the skill of copper’s manipulation and preparation as a special material for use in elite goods on to their descendants. Elites at major political and religious centers during the Mississippian period used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These elites used a trade network that spanned most of North America to acquire exotic trade items from far away, trading their own locally manufactured elite goods and materials.&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/files/spotlightMar10_2.pdf|title=Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum-Spotlight Series March 2010|first=Matthew H.|last=Robb|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in [[medicine bundle]]s among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee (Creek)]], a group of copper plates carried along the [[Trail of Tears]] are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.&lt;ref name="Broseet" /&gt;

==Methods of manufacture==
[[File:NatCopper.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Unworked copper nugget]]
The [[native copper]], as well as the [[Work hardening|knowledge to work it]], is believed to have come from the Great Lakes area, hundreds of miles to the north of the Cahokia polity and most other Mississippian culture sites, although the copper workshops discovered near [[Mound 34]] at Cahokia are so far the only copper workshops found at a Mississippian culture [[archaeological site]].&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern’s]] [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] used an electron microscope to analyze pieces of the flat copper sheets found during excavations at the Mound 34 site at Cahokia. The researchers found that the metal had been repeatedly heated and cooled and while it was softened by the heat, had been hammered, a process known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], similar to how blacksmiths work iron. They were also able to determine that the Cahokian coppersmiths had heated the copper in a wood fire to produce sufficient heat for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311000793|title=Metallurgical analysis of copper artifacts from Cahokia|author1= Chastaina, Matthew L.|author2= Deymier-Black, Alix C.|author3=Kelly, John E.|author4=Brown, James A.|author5= Dunand,David C.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume =38|date=July 2011|pages=1727–1736|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHITE2011/&gt; This process of heating and hammering was repeated over and over until a sheet of the desired thickness was obtained and was sufficient a method to allow the craftsman to work the copper into very thin sheets.&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers have also tried different techniques to duplicate how larger pieces were manufactured. They determined that the larger pieces had not been [[laminate]]d together but had most likely been [[rivet]]ed together with small copper knobs. Researchers were also able to determine that the artisans cut the copper into the desired shapes by bending the sheet metal back and forth until it broke in the desired location.&lt;ref name=WHITE2011&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=USNews|url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2011/06/15/science-explains-ancient-copper-artifacts|title=Researchers Explain Ancient Copper Artifacts|author= White, Erin|date=June 15, 2011|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mississippian culture repoussé plate making HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Working the prepared copper plate]]
After the flat sheets of copper were produced, designs were then embossed into the surfaces probably with stone, bone or wooden tools. [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], an anthropologist working in the early 20th century, worked out a method for flattening and embossing the plates. He hammered raw nuggets of copper smooth and removed imperfections by scouring the surface with a piece of sandstone. He was then able to duplicate the avian designs by resting the sheet of copper on a rawhide pad and pressing into the surface using a piece of pointed deer antler and pressing with his chest. This produced a sharp thin line that when the plate was reversed resembled the embossed lines of the aboriginal artifacts. This process is considered to be roughly similar to how Mississippian coppersmiths probably worked.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wulfing Plates : Products of Prehistoric Americans|author=Watkins, Virginia D.|year=2010|origyear=1950|publisher=Gustavs Library|asin=B004618COA}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Mississippian avian themed copper plates HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of avian themed copper plates]]
==Iconography==
===Avian themed plates===
Avian themed plates are thought to depict aspects of the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|Birdman]]'', a major figure in Mississippian iconography closely associated with warfare, ritual dancing, and the game of [[chunkey]].&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; Numerous examples of similar avian themed plates have been found in locations across the Midwest and Southeast, from the large cache found in [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] near the  bootheel region in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] to others from [[Mangum Mound Site|Mangum]] in Mississippi,&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mangum Plate|journal=[[American Antiquity]]|volume=18|date=July 1952|page=65|jstor=276247|issue=1|doi=10.2307/276247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] in Oklahoma, [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in Georgia, [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds]] in Florida and other sites in Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

====Cahokia and the Birdman====
[[File:Bird Man Cahokia USA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Birdman burial from Cahokia]]
Years of study by archaeologists, ethnologists and historians of artifacts of different materials found at many sites throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States has led many of these researchers to conclude that the cosmology associated with the avian imagery of this artwork originated at [[Cahokia]] (the largest Mississippian culture site, in western Illinois near St Louis, Missouri) between 1100 - 1300 CE. This cosmology was expressed as the "[[Braden style]]", a label applied to [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceramics]], [[Mississippian shell artwork|shell pieces]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]] and copper artifacts all bearing the hallmarks and elements of the same sophisticated style. These pieces were exported to other centers where they were emulated by regional craftsman and became the basis of local styles, such as the "Craig style" of Spiro Mounds, the "Hightower style" of Etowah Mounds and the "[[Hemphill style]]" of Moundville.&lt;ref name=2BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=Sequencing the Braden style within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|editor-first=F.

Avian imagery occupied a central place in Cahokian iconography, with examples including an incised sandstone tablet with a birdman excavated from [[Monks Mound]] and an elaborate elite personage burial in [[Mound 72#Birdman burial|Mound 72]] with thousands of shell beads arranged in the shape of a bird.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

Although no copper plates other than some small fragments have ever been found at Cahokia, it is the only Mississippian culture site to date where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK&gt;{{ cite news|newspaper=SOTT.net|publisher=Signs of the Times|last=Pawlaczyk|first= George|authorlink=George Pawlaczyk|url=http://www.sott.net/articles/show/203233-Copper-men-Archaeologists-uncover-%0AStone-Age-copper-workshop-near-Monk-s-Mound-in-Illinois|title=Copper men: Archaeologists uncover Stone Age copper workshop near Monk's Mound|date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of the copper workshops at [[Mound 34]], (a small mound located on the Ramey Plaza east of [[Monks Mound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34/|title=Cahokia Mounds - Mound 34|publisher=Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233858/http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34|archivedate=April 25, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicate copper was worked there.

===Other themes===
[[File:Etowah copper pieces HRoe 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Bi-lobed arrow plates from Etowah]]
Many of the hundreds of plates found have not been specifically avian themed and come in a variety of other shapes.

==Known locations==

===Arkansas plates===
[[File:Toul Creek plate HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Toul Creek plate from northern Arkansas]]
A number of plates have been found in various sites in eastern [[Arkansas]]. At least three of the Arkansas examples (Rose Mound, Scott Place, and Clay Hill) and two others (a {{convert|32.6 |cm|in|sp=us}} found in a [[Dallas Phase]] burial at the [[Henry Farm Site]] (40 LO 53) in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]] in 1975 and a specimen unexamined by archaeologists thought to come either from the [[Neeley’s Ferry Site|Neeley’s Ferry]] (3 CS 24) or Rose Mound sites in Cross County) have stylistic similarities that indicate they may have all been made by the same artist. Four of the five were found in the [[St. Francis River]] Valley area of Arkansas. Researchers think the five plates may represent a composite creature that is part snake and part hawk as the shape of the tail feathers resemble a rattlesnakes' rattle or that the design may represent a hawk in the act of swallowing a snake.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Southeastern Archaeological Conference|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|date=November 13, 2008|title=Mississippian copper artifacts from Arkansas|author=Mitchem, Jeffrey M.|url=https://uark.academia.edu/JeffreyMMitchem/Papers/1288775/Mississippian_Copper_Artifacts_from_Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copper plate found at the [[Clay Hill Site]] (3 LE 11) in [[Lee County, Arkansas]] has the same chest region design and long narrow shape and distinctive tail feathers as the Scott Site and Rose Mound examples. Although fragmented it is approximately {{convert|14|in|cm}} in length. It was recorded to be in a private collection in 1978 but has not been seen since. The plate was found in an [[Armorel Phase]] burial that also contained a [[Clarksdale bell]], an item of European manufacture that is a hallmark of the 1541 [[Hernando de Soto]] excursion through the southeast. This does not date the era for the production of the plate though as such items were often kept as heirlooms for long periods, even many generations, before they ended up becoming [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In 1910 [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] found a stylized hawk or eagle plate while excavating graves at the [[Rose Mound Site]] (3 CS 27) in [[Cross County, Arkansas]]. The plate was {{convert|16.25|in|cm}} and remarkably well preserved, missing only the tip of one wing. The plate is not embossed but merely a shape cut from a flat copper sheet.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In the 1970s a copper bird {{convert|28|cm|in|sp=us}} in length was found by looters at the [[Scott Site]] (3 MS 24), also known as Big Lake Bridge, in [[Mississippi County, Arkansas]]. The specimen was located at the back of the head of an extended adult burial, and may have been bent over the top of the head. Eight plain pottery vessels grave good vessels were found with it.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

A possible partial avian style plate was found at the [[Magness Site]] (3 IN 8) in [[Independence County, Arkansas]] along with several [[Mississippian culture shell objects#Shell Cups|engraved shell cups]]. The plate is a typical head portion with the forked eye, earspool, and elaborate headdress and hairdo known from other examples. As the lower portion of the plate is missing it is impossible to tell if the figure is a dancer or a human headed bird like the Wulfing A plate.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;
 
A {{convert|8|in|cm}} avian themed plate very similar to the Wulfing Plates copper plate was discovered at the [[Toul Creek Site]] in [[Baxter County, Arkansas]] by several local farmers. The plate was located in the chest area of an extended adult who was also wearing the two limestone ear spools. Other grave goods found in the burial included a marine shell dipper and a {{convert|6|in|cm}} chert knife. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

===Etowah and the Rogan plates===
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Rogan plate, A91117]]
{{main|Etowah plates}} 
The Rogan plates were discovered in a [[stone box grave]] within Mound C at the [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Site]] by [[John P. Rogan]] in the 1880s. Several are very similar to plates later found at Lake Jackson Mounds, and it is believed that the Lake Jackson plates came from Etowah. The designs of the plates are in the Classic Braden style from the Cahokian area, and it is generally thought that some of the plates were manufactured at Cahokia before ending up at sites in the Southeast.&lt;ref name=BOLFING2010/&gt; The two Rogan plates were interred as a pair and are very similar to one another. The first is approximately {{convert|20|in|cm}} and the second {{convert|16|in|cm}}. Holes in the plates suggest they were once hung as a decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : Feathered Serpents &amp; Winged Beings|first=Susan C.|last=Power|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcEp9_6TPtMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=rogan+plates#v=onepage&amp;q=rogan%20plates&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0820325019|date=May 24, 2004|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plates were found by [[Warren K.

These plates, along with artifacts from Spiro and [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept of the S.E.C.C.

===Florida plates===
[[File:Lake Jackson Braden Style Birdman Plate HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Copper Solar Ogee Deity plate found at Lake Jackson Mounds, Florida]]
Although at the periphery of the Mississippian world, Florida has been the site of the discovery many S.E.C.C. associated copper artworks. Archaeologists believe that this is because of the [[busycon]] shell trade, the shells being a valuable ritual and high status trade good to Mississippian elites. It has even been proposed that the [[Fort Walton culture]] founders of the [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds Site]] moved east and founded the settlement in approximately 1100 CE to strategically position themselves in this trade network. Lake Jackson trade for copper pieces seems to have taken place almost exclusively with the Etowah polity of north central Georgia. When Mound 3 at the site was excavated it yielded fourteen copper plates, deposited in the burial mound sometime between 1300—1500 CE.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|author= LeDoux, Spencer C.|degree=Honors|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos |chapter=Chapter 4 : The Lake Jackson Site|url= https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/3248/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Copper Solar Ogee Deity," a {{convert|21|in|cm}} high repoussé copper plate, depicts the profile of a dancing winged figure, wielding a ceremonial mace in its right hand and a severed head in the left. The extended, curling nose resembles a [[proboscis]] and resembles another S.E.C.C. motif, the long-nosed god maskette. The figures elaborate headdress includes a bi-lobed arrow motif and, at the top of the plate, an ogee motif surrounded by a chambered circle. Some art historians have argued that this plate and one of the Rogan plates may represent a female or "Birdwoman" because the breast on the figure protrudes slightly more than it does on other examples, while others have argued that the plate may represent a third gender or "[[two-spirit]]" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Power (2004), Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birdman, Birdwoman : Queering archeology at Lake Jackson|author=Bloch, Lee|url= http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00209/47j|volume=62|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=June 2010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Etowah polity in approximately 1375 trade continued for the Lake Jackson peoples, albeit now with peoples located in the northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee area. No longer able to get the elaborate copper plates from Etowah, a local style developed, producing a new style of such as that depicted on the "Elder Birdman" plate, thought to represent the merger of the Birdman corpus with a local solar deity.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009/&gt;

Further east and south into Florida were non-Mississippian culture peoples who were involved in long distance trade of local high status items such as busycon shells for gorgets and [[yaupon]] holly for the [[black drink]]. The [[Mill Cove Complex]] is a [[St. Johns culture]] site in [[Duval County, Florida]] with two sand burial mounds, one [[platform mound]] shaped and associated village habitation areas. [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] excavated the mounds in 1894 and found numerous copper grave goods, including two copper [[long-nosed god maskette]]s and 11 copper plates. The one plate found in the Shields Mound was plain, but several of the other 10 found in the Grant Mound were decorated with an oval central boss and ringed with an oval embossed or beaded line. They measured {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|15|cm|in|sp=us}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}. They had perforated holes for hanging. Archaeologists speculate they were used either for gorgets or headdress ornaments. Analysis of the metal in the plaques has connected them to locations in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin and the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the periphery of the Early Mississippian world : Looking within and beyond Northeastern Florida|author=Ashley, Keith H.|journal=Southeastern Archaeology| url=http://www.unf.edu/~kashley/Other%20Files/2002-periphery.pdf|volume=2|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in central Florida, the [[Old Okahumpka Site]] (8 LA 57) is a now destroyed burial mound in [[Lake County, Florida]] near the modern town of [[Okahumpka, Florida|Okahumpka]]. The site was excavated by Clarence B. Moore in the 1890s. During his excavation he found a burial associated plate measuring {{convert|7.1|cm|in|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|15.2|cm|in|sp=us}} in length and depicting the lower portion of a dancing figure wearing a sash, kilt, cuffed [[moccasin]]s, and holding a knife. The design is almost identical to two examples known from Spiro and a site in [[Jackson County, Alabama]], although of the three it is the only one to show a figure wielding a knife. Archaeologists estimate the plate was deposited in the mound sometime between 1100 and 1300 CE. The plate is now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM1996&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|title=The Old Okahumpka Site (8LA57): Late Prehistoric Iconography and Mississippian Influence in Peninsular Florida |url=https://www.academia.edu/1101995/The_Old_Okahumpka_Site_8LA57_Late_Prehistoric_Iconography_and_Mississippian_Influence_in_Peninsular_Florida|author=Jeffrey M.

From an unknown location on the west coast of central Florida comes the Wilcox plate, a partial avian themed copper plate showing the middle section details of scalloped wings, tail feathers and a raptors leg and claw in the Malden style very similar to the Wulfing plates. It was discovered somewhere near [[Waldo, Florida]] in [[Levy County, Florida|Levy County]] in the 1880s, where it was purchased from a local doctor by [[Joseph Wilcox]] for the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]].

===Illinois plates===
[[File:Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Figures plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen plate]]
Outside of Cahokia, Illinois has seen the discovery of many Mississippian culture copper items including copper maces, ear spools, several avian plates, a wooden copper covered mask (known as the [[Emmons mask]]), and headdress pieces. Three copper plates have been found, one of them been identified as being from the same workshop as the Wulfing plates and others as having stylistic similarities with the Wulfing, Spiro and Etowah plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

The Edwards falcon plate is a {{convert|37.8|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|11.3|cm|in|sp=us}} copper avian plate found at the [[Material Service Quarry Site]] in [[La Salle County, Illinois]].

The Upper Bluff Lake plates are two plates found at the [[Saddle Site]] (11U284) in [[Union County, Illinois]] in the 1880s, in the same stone box grave. One of the plates is avian themed and the other a unique double birdman design, but still within the corpus of the S.E.C.C. The Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate is a {{convert|25.7|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|8.25|cm|in|sp=us}} avian themed Wulfing style plate. It has a mostly intact tail, which the Malden plates do not, and has helped archaeologists understand what the tails of the other pieces would have looked like.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; The Dancing Figures plate is a rectangular {{convert|15.5|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|16.5|cm|in|sp=us}} plate depicting two Birdman figures holding ceremonial chipped flint maces, possibly dancing, and shielding themselves from a possible liquid or ropelike motif falling from the top center of the plate.

{{main|Wulfing cache}}
The plates of the ''Wulfing cache'', named after an early owner, were discovered by a farmer named Ray Groomes while plowing a field south of [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 213&lt;/ref&gt; The eight plates, made in the Late Braden style associated with Cahokia, are thought to date to the late 13th or early 14th century.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; The Wulfing plates depict raptors and one bird-human hybrids, ranging human heads to raptor's heads to double-headed raptors on stylized bird's bodies, with naturalistic bird's claws.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; The plates were found buried in a field with no known local mounds or village sites. They had been considerably used prior to their burial, as each plates shows multiple episodes of aboriginal repair work including patch repairs and riveted cracks.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

The eight plates are designated Plates A-H. Plate A, the only anthropomorphic human headed avian in the Wulfing cache, measures {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} in length by {{convert|13.5|cm|in|sp=us}} in width and weighs {{convert|84|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

Many similar plates found in other states are now believed to have come from the same workshop, if not the same artist, as the Wulfing cache. The sites of the discovery of these other plates span the United States from central Florida to northern Illinois to Oklahoma, and include the Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate, the Toul Creek plate, the Reed Mound plate, the Edwards plate,&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; and the Wilcox plate,&lt;ref name="MITCHEM" /&gt; as well as showing stylistic links to plates found in burials at Etowah and Spiro.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Spiro plates===
[[File:Spiro human headed avian plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro]]
[[Spiro Mounds]] is a [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] archaeological site located in present-day [[LeFlore County, Oklahoma]]. In the 1930s the only burial mound at the site, the Craig Mound, was looted by locals who used [[dynamite]] on the mound to gain access to its interior. Once inside the {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide cavity the looters discovered almost perfectly preserved fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, feathers and copper. The Great Mortuary, as the hollow interior has since became known to archaeologists, was a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred [[Ulmus crassifolia|cedar posts]] sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a ''[[tipi]]''. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it or with such large and distinctive collection of preserved artifacts. Among the grave goods were numerous copper pieces, including [[ear-spool]]s, [[Celt (tool)|{{not a typo|celts}}]], copper sheathed wooden knives&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt; and 265  repoussé plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; One of the more famous of these copper plates depicts a man's head, possibly severed, in profile, with a Forked Eye motif, an ear-spool, and hair styled into an occipital hair knot from which a single feather projects.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; The plate measures {{convert|24|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|17.4|cm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 211&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the plates is the avian themed "naturalistic hawk cutout", which measures {{convert|11.5|in|cm}} in width.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound:A photo essay|author1=Larry G.

==Other copper items==
[[File:Spiro copper ear spools HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Copper earspools from Spiro]]
Besides the repoussé copper plates, Mississippian people also created copper axes, knives, gorgets, beads, and fishhooks, as well as wooden beads and [[ear spool]]s covered in copper.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 69, 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s, a special kind of ear ornamentation, are sometimes found made of copper.

The '''No Show Museum''' is an [[art museum]], established in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 2015, devoted to [[nothing]] and its various manifestations throughout the [[history of art]]. It claims to be the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;cf.: Art in Berlin: "[http://www.art-in-berlin.de/incbmeld.php?id=3672 Dem Nichts Raum geben]"&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Swiss conceptual artist and curator [[Andreas Heusser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andreasheusser.com/ | title=Andreas Heusser }}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum's collection today includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Virtual collection==
The museum's collection is freely accessible online and displays works, documents, and artifacts from conceptual art, minimalist art, performance art, and painting, as well as from photography, literature, theatre,  film, and music. In all, the collection extends over four  ours, each with two wings, and with various tracts that are thematically dedicated to different way of approaching nothing:
* Nothing as Refusal: The Art of Doing Nothing
* Nothing as Annihilation: The Art of Destruction
* Nothing as Emptiness: The Art of Absence
* Nothing as Invisibility: The Art of The Imperceptible, The Unseen, and The Hidden 
* Nothing as Reduction: The Art of Minimalism
* Nothing as Lacuna: The Art of Omission
* Nothing as Statement: The Art of Saying Nothing Nothing as Notion: The Art of Pure Imagination

The museum also provides background information in German, Spanish and English about all the works and artists. In addition, there is library that provides texts, publications, and exhibition catalogues for further research on nothing in art and other disciplines (philosophy, science, literature, music, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Nana Adusei-Poku: [http://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/101727/on-being-present-where-you-wish-to-disappear/ On Being Present Where You Wish to Disappear]. In: Journal #80 - March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile museum==
=== Converted bus ===
Since 2015, the No Show Museum has been on a world tour with a converted bus. Inside, the mobile museum is a futuristic white cube (4 m long, 2 m wide, 2.10 m high), in which the current special exhibition is shown. It also offers access to the virtual collection via ipad stations and houses the museum shop with a limited selection of souvenirs such as the BUY NOTHING CARD® (personal credit card to buy nothing) or ART FREE AIR® (medicine for allergy sufferers). The matt black painted exterior of the bus serves as a moving blackboard, which can be labeled with announcements and information about the current exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Laura B. Villalta: [http://americanosfera.org/2017/11/museo-de-la-nada-en-marte/ Museo de la Nada en MARTE]. Americanosfera, 16.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic special exhibitions ===
The special exhibitions in the Mobile Museum each illuminate certain aspects, variants and themes of nothingness in art: '' INVISIBLE ARTWORKS '' (2015) presented 24 intangible and invisible works of conceptual art. The show '' NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE ''(2016) focused on works of art that do not exist and can not possibly exist (eg because it simply exceeds the possibilities of producing the artwork, or because trying to realize it leads to unsolvable conceptual and logical contradictions.) The special exhibition '' ¡NO FALTA NADA! '' (2017) was about the art of nothing as an absence, eg because the artwork has been lost or irrevocably destroyed, or because it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnulfo Agüero: [https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2017/12/11/cultura/2345136-viaje-espectacular-del-arte-las-regiones-la-nada Un viaje espectacular del arte a las regiones de la nada]. La Prensa, 12.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nothing world tour==
The No Show Museum has committed itself to the mission to spread nothing all over the globe. For this reason, the museum is touring year after year from continent to continent.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Deutsches Museum (Ed.): Kultur &amp; Technik. Nichts, Edition 1/2018. Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the World Tour started in Zurich in July 2015 and led through 20 countries of Central and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carina Pérez: [http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/76607/llega-el-no-show-museum-al-maco Llega el No Show Museum al MACO]. NVI Noticias, 18.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt; It included around 30 exhibitions in [[museums]] and empty [[Art museum|galleries]] in [[public spaces]] and remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;See: Documentation on [http://www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum] or on [http://www.noshowmuseum.com www.noshowmuseum.com], section "Archive/Past Exhibitions"&lt;/ref&gt; The tour ended in October 2015 with an exhibition and presentation of nothing in [[Venice]] where the No Show Museum was invited by Pro Helvetia's Salon Suisse as an official participant of the [[Biennale di Venezia|56th Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan: "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt;
The third stage took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Baja California in Mexico through the countries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama) to Colombia, with numerous exhibitions in public space and in collaboration with museums and local galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Moreno: [https://elperiodico.com.gt/oculta/2017/11/28/el-arte-en-la-ausencia/ El arte en la ausencia]. El Periodico, 28.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual background==

===Nothing as an aesthetic category ===
In the course of the 20th century, [[nothing]] has become as distinctive an aesthetic category as “the beautiful”, “the ugly” or "the absurd".&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lucy R. Lippard, Six Years: "The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972". New York, Praeger, 1973, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic examination of the (non) [[phenomenon]] "nothing" has led artists and critics to question the traditional practices of art production and open up new possibilities of spatial, temporal and material interpretation. Nothing is usually understood as the [[negation]] of being and figuration, but strictly speaking, it is impossible to define nothing.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lütkehaus, Ludger: "Nichts", Haffmans Verlag, Zürich 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Every attempt to describe, represent or materialize nothing is doomed to fail, and it is this very fact that has inspired many artists of the [[20th century]] to work intensively with [[nothing]] and the [[paradoxes]] of its (re)presentation.
The result is a large number of artistic strategies and works on nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See the following exhibition catalogues on nothing:
* Armleder, John; Copeland, Matthieu; Le Bon, Laurent; Metzger, Gustav; Perret, MaiThu; Phillpot, Clive and Pirotte, Philippe (eds): "Voids: A Retrospective", Zürich : JRP Ringier, 2009
* Hollein, Max, Weinhart, Martina: "Nichts – Nothing", Ostfildern : Hatje Cantz, 2006
* Rugoff, Ralph: "Art about the Unseen", 1957-2012, London: Hayward Publishing, 2012
* Varnedoe, Kirk: "Pictures of Nothing. Abstract Art since Pollock", Princeton/Oxford : Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nothing as a ready-made===
Already in 1913, [[Marcel Duchamp]] demonstrated with his first [[ready-mades]] how any object can be converted into art by removing it from the sphere of ordinary life and placing it in a gallery or [[museum]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dorothee Fauth: "Kunstlexikon: Readymade". Hatje Cantz 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This move from one context to another changes the way spectators view an object: in the context of art, it is no longer perceived as a mere object, but instead as placeholder of an idea or of an artistic intention. The result of such attributions is that the formerly ordinary object is transformed into a [[work of art]].
The same principle can be applied to [[nothing]], and [[nothing]] can equally acquire “the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of the artist” (André Breton).&lt;ref&gt;Hector Olbak: "[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/obalk.html The Unfindable Readymade]"&lt;/ref&gt; The No Show Museum is an attempt to create such an [[institutional framework]] for ensuring in the long run that nothing is art.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The museum as a mobile art context===
Although the museum’s collection is [[virtuality|virtual]], the museum does have a physical space for presentations setup in a restored and customized post bus.  Thus, the museum provides a moving art context that can either be attached to established institutions are function autonomously.  Moreover, the mobile museum offers the opportunity to discover new regions and spaces for the contexts of nothing, and it serves as a marker to indicate any place as an exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]".

"'''One size fits all'''" is a description for a product that would fit in all instances. The term has been extended to mean one style or procedure would fit in all related applications. It is an alternative for "Not everyone fits the mold
".&lt;ref name="EET"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been in use for over 5 decades. There are both positive and negative uses of the phrase.

==History of the phrase==
The term ''"one size fits all"'' has been used as a common, cliche phrase for over 5 decades. It was already a popular term, in 1975, when [[Frank Zappa]] recorded the album ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]''.&lt;ref name="lnk"&gt;For source references, refer to each nearby linked article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive views of the phrase==
There are several positive views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'':

:* A [[wristwatch]] could be considered as fitting all people.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* In women's clothing, a flexible or open garment can be labeled as one-size-fits-all; however, the size is typically a medium size (able to expand), rather than actually fitting petite or extra-large (XL) sizes.
:* A neck chain could be designed to be worn by men or women.
:* [[Bicycle helmet]]s with ring fit systems allow for a single size, also known as [[universal fit]].&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;&lt;ref name="bhsi"&gt;
  "One Size Fits All Bicycle Helmets", BHSI, April 2009,
  web: [http://www.bhsi.org/onesize.htm BHSI-onesiz].&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In military gear, some items have just one size (but smaller or larger people have already been excluded from military service).
:* Many baseball hats available for commercial purchase are labeled "one-size-fits-all"

==Negative views of the phrase==
There are many negative views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'' including:
:* Many customers prefer to have custom-tailored clothing.
:* Men's [[Suit (clothing)|dress suit]]s typically have specific sizes for chest &amp; waist measurements.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* [[Shoes]] are an example where sizes (and widths) vary depending on the specific person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* For the [[United States|U.S.]] [[GI Bill]] in education, options and coverage will vary depending on each person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;

Politically, the phrase has come to mean that methods of administration or political beliefs in one country should not necessarily be applied to another.

{{italic title}}
'''''Paris Street; Rainy Day''''' ({{lang-fr|Rue de Paris, temps de pluie}}) is a large 1877 oil painting by the French artist [[Gustave Caillebotte]] (1848–1894), and is his best known work.&lt;ref name="h624"&gt;Hagen, 624&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a number of individuals walking through the Place de Dublin, then known as the Carrefour de Moscou, at an intersection to the east of the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in north Paris. Although Caillebotte was a friend and patron of many of the impressionist painters, and this work is part of that school, it differs in its realism and reliance on line rather than broad brush strokes.

Caillebotte's interest in photography is evident. The figures in the foreground appear "out of focus", those in the mid-distance (the carriage and the pedestrians in the intersection) have sharp edges, while the features in the background become progressively indistinct. The severe cropping of some figures –particularly the man to the far right– further suggests the influence of photography.

The painting was first shown at the Third [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] Exhibition of 1877. It is currently owned by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20684 Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877]. Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 29 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art Institute of Chicago|AIC]] curator Gloria Groom described the work as "the great picture of urban life in the late 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;Hedy Weiss. "Gustave Who?" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. 12 February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Paris Street; Rainy Day Detail 1.png|thumb|240px|Detail]]
The tone of the light indicates that the painting is set on a wintery afternoon,&lt;ref name="w174"&gt;Weinber, 174&lt;/ref&gt; and the two main figures walk underneath an umbrella.  They are dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion. She wears a hat, veil, diamond earring, demure brown dress, and a fur lined coat, described in 1877 as "modern – or should I say, the latest fashion". The man wears a moustache, [[overcoat|topcoat]], [[frock coat]],&lt;ref name="h627"&gt;Hagen, 627&lt;/ref&gt; top hat, bow tie, starched white shirt, buttoned waistcoat and an open long coat with collar turned up. They are unambiguously middle class, yet some working class figures may be seen in the background; a maid in a doorway, the decorator carrying a ladder, cut-off by the umbrella above him.&lt;ref name="h626"&gt;Hagen, 626&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b19"&gt;Broude, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte juxtaposes the figures and the perspective in a playful manner, with one man appearing to jump from the wheel of a carriage; another pair of legs appear below the rim of an umbrella.

[[File:Gustave Caillebotte, 1877 - Rue de Paris, jour de pluie (étude).jpg|left|thumb|300px|Study for ''Paris Street; Rainy Day'']]
The painting does not present a convivial mood. The figures seem mostly isolated, and their expressions are largely downcast. They appear to hurry rather than stroll through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts. The umbrellas shield them, in the words of Rose-Marie Hagen, "not just from the rain, but, also it seems, from other passers by".&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; Characteristic of the positioning of the figures, the heads and eyes of the main couple are faced away from the man approaching them from their right. Hagen believes that given their close quarters, they will both be unable to comfortably step out of the man's way, but also their averted gaze applies equally to the viewer, who looks from a perspective equal to us.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte reproduces the effect of a camera lens in that the points at the center of the image seem to bulge. He also recreates the focusing effect of the camera in the way that it sharpens certain subjects of an image, but not others. The same purpose is seen in the overall clarity of the image. The foreground is in focus, but slightly smudged; the middle ground has sharp, clear edges and well defined subjects, and the background fades into the distance, becoming more and more blurry the farther back the eye travels. He makes the middle ground section more clear, mimicking the effect of a camera.

The figures appear to have walked into the painting, as though Caillebotte was taking a snapshot of people going about their day; in fact, he spent months carefully placing them within the pictorial space.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; The painting is highly linear;&lt;ref name="b18"&gt;Broude, 18&lt;/ref&gt; its focus draws the viewer's eye to the vantage point at the center of the buildings in the background. The strong vertical of the central green lamp post divides the painting; a horizontal alignment breaks the painting into quarters; the gaslight at the center of the picture throws shadows on the wet cobblestones, and divides the composition in two. Cobblestones dominate one full quarter of the canvas.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt;

==Setting==
[[File:Place de Dublin, Paris May 2010.jpg|thumb|320px|2010 photograph of the [[Place de Dublin]]]]
''Paris Street; Rainy Day'' gives a view from the eastern side of the {{ill|Rue de Turin|fr|Rue de Turin (Paris)}}, looking north toward the [[Place de Dublin]]. The neoclassical buildings reflect the construction works of [[Baron Haussmann]]. The view shown is spacious, and details a broad view of a number of streets. Although the [[ashlar]] facades of the buildings might today seem uniform, at the time they would have been modern and fresh – in Caillebotte's youth the area was a hill just beyond the city edge just beginning to be developed as a residential center for the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Three roads are visible on the northern side of the square: the {{ill|rue de Moscou|fr|Rue de Moscou (Paris)}} (left), the {{ill|rue Clapeyron|fr}} (center), and a continuation of the rue de Turin (right), which runs from the foreground and into the background. The square is crossed by the {{ill|rue de Saint-Pétersbourg|fr}}, suggested by the line of the buildings to the left and a break in the buildings to the right.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; The point of view of the roads and the buildings portrayed allows Caillebotte to use [[two-point perspective]].

==Reception and provenance==
[[Émile Zola]], often a critic of Caillebotte,  praised this work in an article "Notes parisiennes: Une exposition: les peintres impressionnistes" published in ''Le Sémaphore de Marseille'' in 1877.

As with many of Caillebotte's paintings, it remained with the family until the mid twentieth century. It was acquired by [[Walter P. Chrysler Jr.]] in 1955, who in turn sold it to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ?projectId=art-project#!asset-viewer:l.id=5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ&amp;projectId=art-project&amp;urlStub=Paris%20Street%3B%20Rainy%20Day Paris Street; Rainy Day1877], Google Art Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Paul S.C. Taçon received his MA in [[Anthropology]] from [[Trent University]] in 1984 and his PhD from the [[Australian National University]] in 1990. He was based at the [[Australian Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australia |url=http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/ |title=nature, culture, discover |publisher=Australian Museum |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sydney from 1991 to 2005, acting as a principal research scientist in anthropology from 1998 to 2005 and Head of the Museum's People and Place Research Centre from 1995 to 2003. In 2005, Paul S.C. Taçon joined [[Griffith University]] and has since led two ongoing research programs, "Picturing Change" and "Late Pleistocene Peopling of East Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/staff/professor-paul-tacon |title=Professor Paul Taçon - Griffith University |publisher=Griffith.edu.au |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328100713/http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/staff/professor-paul-tacon |archivedate=March 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has pioneered the use of [[radiocarbon dating]] of [[beeswax]] rock art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/date/web/tuniz.html |title=Dating Australian Rock-Markings: An Interdisciplinary Challenge |publisher=Mc2.vicnet.net.au |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407025215/http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/date/web/tuniz.html |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his research team was the first to use [[uranium]]-series direct dates for rock art in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aubert |first=Maxime |url=https://uow.academia.edu/MaximeAubert/Papers/1177530/Uranium-series_age_estimates_for_rock_art_in_southwest_China |title=Uranium-series age estimates for rock art in southwest China (Maxime Aubert) - Academia.edu |publisher=Uow.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, he is leading the use of innovative three-dimensional laser scanners to conserve vulnerable rock art sites.

==Place, Evolution and Rock Art Heritage Unit==
Paul S.C. Taçon recently established the Place, Evolution and Rock Art Heritage Unit (PERAHU) at Griffith University. This research unit is located within the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120104214934/http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities School of Humanities] and advocates multidisciplinary, multicultural and scientific approaches to rock art and cultural evolution research. He has close collaborations with the [http://rsh.anu.edu.au/rockart/ Rock Art Research Centre] at the [[Australian National University]] and the [http://www.uwa.edu.au/rock-art/research Centre for Rock-Art Studies] at the [[University of Western Australia]]. Together, these three research groups are the foremost authority on rock art research in Australia.

The '''Salon''' ({{lang-fr|Salon}}), or rarely '''Paris Salon''' (French: ''Salon de Paris''), beginning in 1667&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Salon French art exhibition|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Salon-French-art-exhibition|website=britannica.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the official [[art exhibition]] of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. Between 1748 and 1890 it was arguably the greatest annual or biennial art event in the Western world. At the 1761 Salon, thirty-three painters, nine sculptors, and eleven engravers contributed.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700–1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 3. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881 onward, it has been managed by the [[Société des Artistes Français]].

== Origins ==
In 1667, the royally sanctioned French institution of art patronage, the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; (a division of the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]), held its first semi-public art exhibit at the Salon Carré. The Salon's original focus was the display of the work of recent graduates of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], which was created by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], chief minister of France, in 1648. Exhibition at the Salon de Paris was essential for any artist to achieve success in France for at least the next 200 years. Exhibition in the Salon marked a sign of royal favor.

In 1725, the Salon was held in the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]], when it became known as ''Salon'' or ''Salon de Paris''. In 1737, the exhibitions, held from 18 August 1737 to 5 September 1737 at the Grand Salon of the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;“Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800,” by Robert W. Berger, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; became public. They were held, at first, annually, and then biennially, in odd-numbered years. They would start on the feast day of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] (25 August) and run for some weeks. Once made regular and public, the Salon's status was "never seriously in doubt" (Crow, 1987). In 1748 a [[jury]] of awarded artists was introduced. From this time forward, the influence of the Salon was undisputed.

== Prominence (1748–1890) ==
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 Salon.]]
The Salon exhibited paintings floor-to-ceiling and on every available inch of space. The jostling of artwork became the subject of many other paintings, including [[Pietro Antonio Martini]]'s ''Salon of 1785''. Printed catalogues of the Salons are primary documents for art historians. Critical descriptions of the exhibitions published in the [[gazette]]s mark the beginning of the modern occupation of [[art critic]].

The [[French revolution]] opened the exhibition to foreign artists. In the 19th century the idea of a public Salon extended to an annual government-sponsored juried exhibition of new painting and sculpture, held in large commercial halls, to which the ticket-bearing public was invited. The ''[[vernissage]]'' (varnishing) of opening night was a grand social occasion, and a crush that gave subject matter to newspaper caricaturists like [[Honoré Daumier]]. [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and others wrote reviews of the Salons.

The [[1848 revolution]] liberalized the ''Salon''. The amount of refused works was greatly reduced. In 1849 [[medal]]s were introduced.

=== Early splinter groups ===
The increasingly conservative and [[Academic art|academic]] juries were not receptive to the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painters,&lt;ref name=Impressionists&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of the Salon and the Rise of Impressionism|url=http://www.radford.edu/rbarris/art216upd2012/Impressionism.html|website=radford.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose works were usually rejected, or poorly placed if accepted. The Salon opposed the Impressionists' shift away from traditional painting styles. In 1857&lt;ref&gt;The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism, page 59, by Ross King&lt;/ref&gt; the Salon jury turned away an unusually high number of the submitted paintings. An uproar resulted, particularly from regular exhibitors who had been rejected. In order to prove that the Salons were democratic, [[Napoleon III]] instituted the [[Salon des Refusés]], containing a selection of the works that the Salon had rejected that year. It opened on 17 May 1863, marking the birth of the [[avant-garde]]. The [[Impressionists]] held their own independent exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886.

In 1881, the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the [[Société des Artistes Français]] to take responsibility for the show.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

In December 1890, the leader of the ''Société des Artistes Français'', [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], propagated the idea that ''Salon'' should be an exhibition of young, not-yet awarded, artists. [[Ernest Meissonier]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]] and others rejected this proposal and made a secession. They created the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] and its own exhibition, immediately referred to in the press as the ''Salon du Champ de Mars'' &lt;ref&gt;Auguste Dalligny, 'Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts – l'Exposition du Champ de Mars', Journal des Arts, 16 May 1890&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux–Arts'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Bluysen]], 'Le Salon du Champ de Mars – IV, La République francaise, 23 June 1890&lt;/ref&gt; it was soon also widely known as the ''Nationale''.

In 1903, in response to what many artists at the time felt was a bureaucratic and conservative organization, a group of painters and sculptors led by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Auguste Rodin]] organized the [[Salon d'Automne]].

The '''Great Seal of the State of Hawaii''' was designated officially by Act 272 of the 1959 Territorial Legislature and is based on the territorial seal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html Names and Insignia of Hawaii&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications to the territorial seal included the use of the words "[[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]]" at the top and "1959" within the circle. Provisions for a seal for the state of Hawaii was enacted by the Territorial Legislator and approved by Governor [[William F. Quinn]] on June 8, 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Pamphlet that accompanied ”The Official Statehood Medal Commemorating the Admission of Hawaii as the 50th State of the United States of America, August 21, 1959”, Medallic Art Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the [[Hawaii Admission Act|Admission Act]] in 1959, admitted Hawaii as the 50th State of the United States of America on August 21, 1959.

The seal of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] was the same as the seal of the republic, except that it had "Territory of Hawaii"  placed at the top and "1900" (signifying the year that the territorial government officially was organized) within the circle.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The 1901 Territorial Legislature authorized the modified republic seal as the Seal of the Territory of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The seal of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] had the words "Republic of Hawaii" at the top and "MDCCCXCIV" within the circle. The year 1894 signified the date that the republic was established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The republic seal was designed by Viggo Jacobsen, a Honolulu resident, and itself was derived from the Kingdom of Hawaii coat of arms used during the reign of  [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]], [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]] and [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], which had been designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London in 1842 and officially adopted in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great State seals of the United States|last=Berg|first=Annemarie|page=41|year=1979|isbn=978-0-396-07705-3|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead and Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State Seal==
The '''Great Seal of the State of Hawaii''' is circular in shape, two and three-quarters inches in diameter, and of the design being described, with the tinctures added as the basis for the coat of arms. The Hawaii state seal represents Hawaii's nation.

==Arms design==
In the center of the seal is a heraldic shield which is quartered. The first and fourth quarters display the white, red, and blue stripes of ''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'' or the [[Flag of Hawaii|flag of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The second and third quarters are on a yellow field with a white ''Pulo{{okina}}ulo{{okina}}u'', or [[kapu]] sticks with tapa-covered balls on the end. In the center of the heraldic shield is a green escutcheon with a five-pointed yellow star in the center.

==Supporters design==
On the left side is Kamehameha I, standing in the attitude as represented by the bronze statue in front of [[Ali'iolani Hale]], Honolulu. His cloak and helmet (a mahiole) are in yellow. Kamehameha I's figure is in [[Proper (heraldry)|proper]]. [[Kamehameha I]]  unified the [[Hawaiian Islands]] into a single united kingdom. On the right side is goddess Liberty also wearing a Phrygian cap and laurel wreath. She is holding ''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'' in her right hand that is partly unfurled.

==Crest design==
A rising sun irradiated in gold surrounded by the legend "State of Hawaii, 1959" on a scroll in black lettering.

==Motto design==
The [[state motto]]: ''[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono]]'' is on the scroll on the seal's bottom in gold lettering. ''Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono'' is roughly translated into [[English language|English]] as "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness." The motto was adopted by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] in 1843 and was used in an address by King [[Kamehameha III]] at ceremonies following the return of his kingdom from the British. British captain Lord George Paulet of {{HMS|Carysfort|1836|6}} demanded that [[Paulet Affair (1843)|Hawai{{okina}}i was ceded]] to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in response to claims of political abuses against British residents made by British Consul [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]]. After Kamehameha III notified [[London]] of the captain's actions, Admiral [[Richard Darton Thomas]] returned sovereignty back to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Thomas Square nomination form |author= Dorothy Riconda |work= National Register of Historic Places |date= March 23, 1972 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |url= {{NRHP url|id=72000423}} |accessdate=2010-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motto is also featured in [[Israel Kamakawiwo'ole]]'s song "Hawaii '78" and is used on the Hawaii [[state quarter]].

==[[Compartment (heraldry)|Compartment]] design==
Below the heraldic shield, the bird [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] has it wings outstretched arising from flames. The phoenix's body is black and wings half yellow and half dark red. Below the heraldic shield are eight [[taro|taro leaves]] having on either side [[banana|banana foliage]] and sprays of [[maidenhair fern]] trailed upwardly.

==Symbolism==
*1959 represents the year of admission into the Union as a state.
*The rising sun replaced the royal crown from the original coat of arms. This represents the birth of a new state.
*[[King Kamehameha the Great]] and the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] holding the Hawaiian flag replace the two warriors on the royal coat of arms. This may represent the old government leader (King Kamehameha the Great) and the new government leader (The Goddess of Liberty).
*The quartered design of the heraldic shield is retained from the original coat of arms.
*The eight stripes in two of the quarters of the shield represent the eight main islands.
*The ''[[puloulou|Pulo{{okina}}ulo{{okina}}u]]'', or ''[[tabu ball]] and stick'', in the second and third quarters was carried before the king and placed before the door of his home, signifying his authority and power. In the seal it is a symbol of the authority and power of the government.
*The star in the middle of the shield signifies the fiftieth star added to the United States flag.
*The [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], symbol of death and resurrection, symbolizes the change from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a free, [[U.S. state|democratic form of government]].
*The eight [[taro|taro leaves]], flanked by [[banana|banana foliage]] and [[maidenhair fern]] are typical Hawaiian flora and represent the eight main islands. Taro is the traditional staff of life and has great spiritual significance. Taro is also still cultivated and is the ingredient of the popular dish called [[poi (food)|poi]].
*The state motto, "''[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono]]''", "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness," is retained from the royal coat of arms.

A '''Single Screen''' game perspective can apply to all video games in which the entire playfield is shown on the screen, and the player character is unable to move beyond the boundaries of the screen either to a) scroll the game world (e.g. [[Mappy]]), or b) move to a different screen (e.g. [[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Diorama (game perspective)|diorama]] perspective, which refers to non-screen based games ([[shooting range#Shooting gallery|shooting galleries]], [[pinball]] and other mechanical games) which were popular before and during the early years of video games. Also not to be confused with hybrid perspective games such as Caveman (Gottlieb), and [[Boot Hill (video game)|Boot Hill]] (Midway), which because of their dual camera nature are harder to classify into one perspective.

==History==
Single Screen video games became popular in the early 1970s with [[Pong]]. They offered a simpler and more affordable alternative to the expensive electro mechanical games of the time (such as Sega's Periscope).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon and Beyond : the Story Behind the Craze that Touched Our Lives and Changed the World|url = https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ultimate_History_of_Video_Games.html?id=C2MH05ogU9oC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher = Prima Pub.|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780761536437|language = en|first = Steve L.|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: from Pong to Pokemon and beyond...the story behind the craze that touched our li ves and changed the world|url = https://books.google.co.za/books?id=PTrcTeAqeaEC&amp;pg=PT469&amp;lpg=PT469&amp;dq=periscope++sega+1295&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=amEv-8_Yfe&amp;sig=g-GkfQ8s4JjjzwuDKvFnFxb8Ojo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Crown/Archetype|date = 2010-06-16|isbn = 9780307560872|language = en|first = Steven|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of these early games though was their lack of color and three dimensional effects compared to other games like [[Sonar (arcade game)|Sonar]].
In spite of these limitations single screen games were made covering multiple genres, including racing ([[Gran Trak 10]]), vehicle combat ([[Tank (video game)|Tank]]), shooting galleries ([[Qwak!]]), evasion / collection ([[Shark Jaws]]), and multiplayer shooters ([[Western Gun]]). In contrast to Pinball though (which could offer many more minutes per play) these games were still lacking, due to either their timed play mechanics (through a clock or limited ammunition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tracer - Videogame by Sega|url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=12739|website = www.arcade-museum.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Arcade games to move beyond these limitations was [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]], and when it was released in 1976 it would go on to inspire [[Space Invaders]], the second game to offer a much longer play time than what was common in this game perspective. The next big evolution in this game perspective was then the introduction of multiple screen types ([[Donkey Kong]]) and randomized elements in combination with destructible environments ([[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]) to add not only duration, but greater variety in the single screen experience.

'''Skoob''' is a collaborative [[Social networking service|social network]] for [[Brazil]]ian readers, launched in January 2009 by developer Lindenberg Moreira.&lt;ref name="skoob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazetaonline.globo.com/_conteudo/2010/10/687046-leitura+em+rede.html|title=Leitura em rede| publisher=[[Globo.com]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without advertising, the site became a meeting point for readers and writers who exchange tips about books and organize meetings in bookstores. The network allows interaction with other social networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as popular e-commerce stores in Brazil, such as: Americanas.com, Saraiva, and Submarino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI96567-15220,00-REDES+SOCIAIS+TRAZEM+A+LITERATURA+PARA+A+INTERNET.html|title=Redes sociais trazem a literatura para a internet|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skoob's name comes from the English word "[[book]]s" spelled backwards. Through free registration, the user creates a profile showing what books they are reading or rereading, have read, want to read, or are no longer reading, thus forming a  "virtual bookshelf". Users can also add missing titles and share their views on the books via assessments and reviews. On January 27, 2012, a survey was released that indicates that Skoob had more than 1.200.000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2012/01/skoob-a-rede-social-de-leitores-brasileiros-chegou-aos-420-mil-usuarios-cadastrados.html|title=Skoob, a rede social de leitores brasileiros, chegou aos 420 mil usuários cadastrados|website=TechTudo|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:02 Sol Kjok Getting-There.jpg|thumb|''Getting There'', 2014]]

Kjøk specializes in painting, drawing and performance with a focus on the [[nude (art)|nude]] [[figure drawing|figure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbns.sh/isbn/9783981250350|title=ISBN 9783981250350 &gt; Sol Kjøk, entre sol et ciel: 24 April - 15 May 2009, Art House Tacheles Berlin by  Kunsthaus Tacheles Berlin &gt; Compare Discount Book Prices &amp; Save up to 90% &gt; isbns.sh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York art critic Meghan Dailey describes her core themes as "the [[human body|body]], its limits and the tension between its strength and its vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Sol-Kj%C3%B8k-ENTRE-SOL-CIEL/dp/3981250354|title=Sol Kjøk: ENTRE SOL ET CIEL|first1=Tacheles|last1=e.V|first2=Martin|last2=Reiter|first3=Donald|last3=Kuspit|first4=Meghan|last4=Dailey|first5=Gisella|last5=Sorrentino|first6=Joe|last6=Grant|first7=Petrea|last7=Frid|first8=Les|last8=Whyte|first9=Matilde|last9=Soligno|first10=Barbara|last10=Fragogna|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Tacheles e.V.|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other artists who portray the nude at rest, Kjøk's bodies are usually in constant motion. This dynamic quality springs from her unique, highly athletic, immersive artistic technique. Her work begins in her studio, with she and her models engaging in an acrobatic process, "which incorporates picture taking, laborious posing and performance, cutting, [[collage|collaging]], rearranging and finally meditative reassemblage through drawing and painting..."&lt;ref name="Swirling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Swirling-Sviv-Solveig-Kj%C3%B8k-Nov--Dec/dp/B0010YHOY0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424312565&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=solveig%20kjok|title=Swirling|first1=Sol|last1=Kjøk|first2=Donald B.|last2=Kuspit|first3=Petrea|last3=Frid|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=Tegnerforbundet Galleri [The Drawing Art Association of Norw|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjøk, a marathoner, approaches large-scale wall drawings as an "extreme sport". Of her 2009 solo-exhibit at [[Kunsthaus Tacheles]], it was reported; "The wall work in Berlin was made in one week, during which Sol Kjøk lived in the gallery and worked virtually around the clock for seven intense consecutive days."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Svingen Mo,"Analog Amour" translated from Norwegian SNITT: Magasin for visuell kommunikasjon, No. 6, 2009 {{Interlanguage link multi|Snitt (magazine)|no|3=Snitt (tidsskrift)}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same exhibit, Meghan Dailey wrote, "For much of that period, she is alone ([[solitude]] being the optimal condition for maximum [[attentional control|concentration]]), eating and sleeping very little. In the course of working so intensely, notions of the [[self]] and of time collapse, until mentally and physically, Kjøk reaches a heightened state in which she feels a part of the piece."&lt;ref&gt;[http://buch-info.org/t/Sol_Kj%C3%B8k,_entre_sol_et_ciel Meghan Dailey, " Always Somebody Moving" in exhibition catalogue: Entre Sol et Ciel, Berlin: Art House Tacheles, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Kjøk has completed "wall drawing as extreme sport" rounds in four countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hallandsposten.se/nojekultur/1.237371-visar-kroppar-i-rorelse Showing Bodies in Motion, Hallandsposten, July 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although highly physical in both its subject and execution, Kjøk's art also incorporates many [[spirituality|spiritual]] themes. Of the paradoxically corporeal and spiritual quality of her work, [[Noel Kelly (curator)]] wrote "There is no doubt that these are sexual figures, However, the sometimes contorted [[physiognomy]] and physicality of the figures speaks of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]; a rapture wherein strength, tenderness, vigour and tempestuous urgency portray the essence of the human state."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Book-Swells-Sol-Kj%C3%B8k/dp/B00TYMO8PI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424876441&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Sol+Kjok Noel Kelly Book of Swells Exhibition Catalogue. Laholm, Sweden: Teckningsmuseet -The Nordic Museum of Drawing, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Franz of [[Xavier University]] echoed this, saying "Ms. Kjøk writes of love, but her images are not necessarily sexual; at least no more than any other human image. No, if they are born of love, and therefore evoke love, it is of a higher order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasonfranz.com/writing/dreams.html|title=About|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kjøk herself acknowledges this duality in her [[artist's statement]], saying "I used to think that [[monasticism|monastic]] seclusion at a safe distance from my body was the way to [[knowledge]]. Now I am convinced that human beings are clothed in flesh for a reason: The path is through the skin. Opting for either [[Dionysus]] or [[Apollo]] is choosing the easy way out; the challenge is to maintain the balance between the two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solkjok.com/pages/globe_e|title=Sol Kjøk: Globe E|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these claims of a spiritual vision, some have found her work shockingly sensual
with one writer describing her figures as "a cross between the [[androgyny|androgynous]] representatives of some future race and the randy hippies of [[Alex Comfort]]'s [[The Joy of Sex|Joy of Sex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/something-weird-grows-in-brooklyn/Content?oid=1259502|title=Something weird grows in Brooklyn|first=Felicia|last=Feaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Kjøk's work has received numerous accolades from critics. The prominent American critic [[Donald Kuspit]] praised her, saying, "Sol Kjok's figures – male and female nudes – are exquisitely drawn, often down to the least detail of their muscular flesh and expressive faces, indicating that she is not only a master draftsperson but a student of the human condition." […] "Certain passages of Swirling are sheer linear [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] – Kjøk seems to delight in the act of drawing itself, not simply in describing the figure."&lt;ref name="Swirling"/&gt;
[[File:03 Sol Kjok Push and Pull.jpg|thumb|''Push and Pull'', 2013]]
New York Times art critic [[D. Dominick Lombardi]] wrote admiringly, "Sol Kjøk's art is playful and energetic.... Then there is a universal strength; a [[pleasure]], a movement in her art that is clear and profound. It is obvious if you spend any time with her creations: Kjøk loves what she is doing. A feeling that emanates through every line, every form, every expression she records with obsessive precision..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_sil_773448|title=Strings of beads = perlestrenger : Sol Kjok - Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish writer Britte Montigny said, "It is expertly done. So dazzlingly accomplished that you all but miss the fact that Sol Kjøk's work also holds [[existentialism|existential]] questions with a full range of feelings, spanning from safety-seeking [[anxiety]] and [[fear]], to protective love and [[joy]] of life."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://hallandsposten.se/nojekultur/1.240293-ekvilibristisk-teknik-och-akrobatik Britte Montigny,"Equilibristic Technique and Acrobatics"  translated from Swedish Hallandsposten August 12, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[NYArts]], Helmer Lång wrote "This makes for a kind of [[conceptual art]] where the artist directs the action, in such a way that the result reads both dramatic and mystifying. The viewer constantly feels that there is much more to this than a simple juggling with the organic forms of the human body; there are also symbolic accents and even a philosophy of life."&lt;ref name="Agile Attempts - NY Arts Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/?p=5785|title=Agile Attempts - NY Arts Magazine|date=May 27, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spolia''''' ([[Latin]], 'spoils'), repurposed building stone for new construction, or decorative sculpture reused in new monuments, is the result of an ancient and widespread practice whereby stone that has been quarried, cut, and used in a built structure, is carried away to be used elsewhere.  The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.

Archaeologist [[Philip A. Barker]] gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from [[Wroxeter]] that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=A. Philip|title=Techniques of Archaeological Excavation|date=1977 |publisher=Routledge|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was common in [[late antiquity]].  Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures.  According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester  (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that  their building stone could be repurposed by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|St. Wulstan]] to construct a cathedral in 1084.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;  And the parish churches of [[Atcham]], [[Wroxeter]], and [[Upton Magna]] are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum]].&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

Roman examples include the [[Arch of Janus]], the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the [[Arch of Constantine]], the colonnade of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the [[Panagia Gorgoepikoos]] church in [[Athens]]); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in [[St Albans Cathedral]], in much of the medieval architecture of [[Colchester]], porphyry columns in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], and the colonnade of the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the [[hypostyle]] mosques of [[Kairouan]], [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Gaza]] and [[Mezquita|Cordoba]].

Although the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for "spoliation" could not be found.

Interpretations of spolia generally alternate between the "ideological" and the "pragmatic." Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of "spoils" or "booty" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.

Spolia had [[apotropaic]] spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted&lt;ref&gt;Foss, "Late Antique and Byzantine Ankara" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''31''' (1977:65).&lt;/ref&gt; that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at [[Ankara#Roman history|Ankara]], where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Religion and Imperium under Augustus|Augustus]]. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the ''[[daimon]]es'' that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.

Liz James extends Foss's observation&lt;ref&gt;James, "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12–20) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in [[Miletus]], [[Sardis]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Pergamum]]: "laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit," Liz James observes. "Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes".&lt;ref&gt;James 1996, noting O. Hjort, "Augustus Christianus—Livia Christiana: ''Sphragis'' and Roman portrait sculpture", in L. Ryden and J.O. Rosenqvist, ''Aspects of Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium'' (Transactions of the Swedish Institute in Istanbul, IV) 1993:93–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">The '''Swedish Art Music Society''' ({{Lang|sv|Musikaliska konstföreningen}}) is a non-profit organisation with the aim of publishing Swedish art music. It was founded by Swedish composers in 1859 to facilitate the publishing of Swedish art music, then largely controlled by German publishers.

Each year, one or a couple of pieces of music are selected for publication. Composers include [[Wilhelm Stenhammar|Stenhammar]], [[Amanda Röntgen-Maier|Röntgen-Maier]], [[Hugo Alfvén|Alfvén]], [[Otto Olsson|Olsson]], [[Gunnar de Frumerie|de Frumerie]], [[Dag Wirén|Wirén]], Carlstedt and Welin. Often, contemporary music is chosen, but sometimes the organisation elects to publish older masterpieces which have remained unpublished, such as the recent publication of the symphonies by the Swedish 18th-century composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert|Eggert]].

The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "Crisis in the Hot Zone".&lt;ref name="PrestonCrisis"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Preston |date=October 26, 1992 |title=Crisis in the Hot Zone |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/10/26/crisis-in-the-hot-zone |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Filoviridae|filoviruses]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Sudan virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Ravn virus]] are [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety Level 4]] agents. Biosafety Level 4 agents are extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high case-fatality rate, and have no known [[prophylactics]], treatments, or cures.

Along with describing the history of the diseases caused by these two [[Central Africa]]n diseases, [[Ebola virus disease]] and [[Marburg virus disease]], Preston described a 1989 incident in which a relative of Ebola virus, named [[Reston virus]], was discovered at a primate quarantine facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], less than 15 miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from [[Washington, D.C.]] The virus found at the facility was a mutated form of the original Ebola virus and was initially mistaken for [[Simian hemorrhagic fever virus|Simian hemorrhagic fever]]. The original Reston facility involved in the incident, located at 1946 Isaac Newton Square, was subsequently demolished on 30 May 1995, and a new building was constructed in its place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindercare.com/our-centers/center-details/303031/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/eeegi/image/24157826 E.G.

== Synopsis ==
The book is in four sections:

* "The Shadow of Mount Elgon" delves into the history of filoviruses, as well as speculation about the origins of [[AIDS]]. Preston recounts the story of "Charles Monet" (a [[pseudonym]]), who might have caught Marburg virus from visiting [[Kitum Cave]] on [[Mount Elgon]] in [[Kenya]]. The author describes in great detail the progression of the disease, from the initial headache and backache, to the final stage in which Monet's internal organs fail and he "bleeds out" (i.e., hemorrhages extensively) in a waiting room in a Nairobi hospital. This part also introduces a young promising physician who became infected with Marburg virus while treating Monet. Nancy Jaax's story is told. Viruses, [[biosafety level]]s and procedures were described. The Ebola virus disease outbreaks caused by Ebola virus and its cousin, [[Sudan virus]], are mentioned. Preston talks to the man who named the Ebola virus.
* "The Monkey House" chronicles the discovery of [[Reston virus]] among imported monkeys in [[Reston, Virginia]], and the following actions taken by the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]]. It starts with the monkey house receiving a shipment of 100 wild monkeys. After four weeks, 29 of these monkeys have died. This is followed by the veterinarian for the facility, Dan Dalgard, examining the dead monkeys and sending the samples to [[Peter Jahrling]], a virologist at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. After seeing a rope-like virus under the microscope, it is suspected that the monkeys were infected with a hot agent similar to the [[Marburg virus disease|Marburg]] virus. Jahrling then conducts a blood test to find out that the hot agent is the Ebola Zaire virus. This conclusion leads to the Army Medical Research Institute deciding to euthanize all the monkeys in the same room as the infected monkeys.
* "Smashdown" is more on the Reston epizootic, which involved a strain of the virus that does not affect humans but which easily spreads by air, and is very similar to its cousin the [[Ebola virus]].
* "Kitum Cave" tells of the author's visit of the cave that is the suspected home of the natural [[host (biology)|host]] animal that Ebola lives inside of.

The book starts with "Charles Monet" visiting [[Kitum Cave]] during a camping trip to Mount Elgon in Central Africa. Not long after, he begins to suffer from a number of symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and red eye. He is soon taken to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, but his condition deteriorates further and he goes into a coma while in the waiting room. This particular filovirus is called [[Marburg virus]].

Dr. Nancy Jaax had been promoted to work in the Level 4 Biosafety containment area at the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]], and is assigned to research [[Ebola virus]]. While preparing food for her family at home, she cuts her right hand. Later, while working on a dead monkey infected with Ebola virus, one of the gloves on the hand with the open wound tears, and she is almost exposed to contaminated blood, but does not get infected. Nurse Mayinga is also infected by a nun and elects to visit Nairobi Hospital for treatment, where she succumbs to the disease.

In Reston, Virginia, less than fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from Washington, D.C., a company called Hazelton Research once operated a [[quarantine]] center for monkeys that were destined for laboratories. In October 1989, when an unusually high number of their monkeys began to die, their veterinarian decided to send some samples to Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for study.  Early during the testing process in [[Biosafety level#Levels|biosafety level 3]], when one of the flasks appeared to be contaminated with harmless [[pseudomonas]] [[bacterium]], two USAMRIID scientists exposed themselves to the virus by [[waft]]ing the flask. They later determine that, while the virus is terrifyingly lethal to monkeys, humans can be infected with it without any health effects at all. This virus is now known as [[Reston virus]].

Finally, the author himself goes into Africa to explore Kitum Cave. On the way, he discusses the role of [[AIDS]] in the present, as the highway they were on, sometimes called the "[[Kinshasa Highway|AIDS Highway]]", or the "Kinshasa Highway", was where it first appeared. Equipped with a [[hazmat suit]], he enters the cave and finds a large number of animals, one of which might be the virus carrier. At the conclusion of the book, he travels to the quarantine facility in Reston.  He finds the building abandoned and deteriorating. He concludes the book by claiming that Ebola will be back.

== Reston Virus Outbreak ==
The discovery of the [[Reston virus]] was made in November 1989 by Thomas W. Geisbert, an intern at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. Dr. Peter B. Jahrling isolated the filovirus further. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted blood tests of the 178 animal handlers. While 6 tested positive, they did not exhibit any symptoms. The Reston virus was found to have low [[pathogenicity]] in humans. This was further supported later when a handler infected himself during a necroscopy of an infected monkey. However, the handler did not show symptoms of the virus after the incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC|last=McCormick|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7607-1208-5|location=|pages=298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Hot Zone'' was listed as one of around 100 books that shaped a century of science by ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, P. 100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science. Retrieved February 17, 2016, from http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science&lt;/ref&gt; Listed as an “Exploration,” the criteria dictate that the book typically “seeks to engage with the context” elucidating the general topic rather than a specific nuance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Many reviews of ''The Hot Zone'' exemplify the impact the book had on the public’s view of [[Emergent virus|emerging viruses.]] A review in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' captures the paranoia and public panic described in this book. The reviewer was left “wondering when and where this enigmatic agent will appear next and what other disasters may await human primates.”&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, N. S.. (1994). [Review of The Hot Zone]. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 309(6962), 1168–1169. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/29725319&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen in a review in the ''Public Health Reports'' which highlights the “seriousness of our current situation” and “our ability to respond to a major health threat.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse, S. A.. (1995). The Year 2000: Only a Plane Flight Away from Disaster? [Review of The Hot Zone; The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance]. Public Health Reports (1974-), 110(2), 223–225. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4597805&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has been criticized for exaggerating the threat of [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and causing viral panic. In an interview about his book about Ebola, [[David Quammen]] claimed that ''The Hot Zone'' had “vivid, gruesome details” that gave an “exaggerated idea of Ebola over the years” causing “people to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon.”&lt;ref&gt;Doucleff, M. (2014, November 11). How 'The Hot Zone' Got It Wrong And Other Tales Of Ebola's History.

''The Hot Zone'' is described as a “romantic account of environmental transgression.” Reactions to this book could be seen not only in the public’s view of emerging viruses, but in the changes in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. In addition to the funding of public health infrastructure during the early 1970s, there were many public discussions of biodefense. This book continued to fuel the emerging diseases campaign. By connecting international health to [[Bioterrorism|national security]], this campaign used ''The Hot Zone'' as a method of justifying increased intervention in the global phenomena of disease.&lt;ref&gt;King, N. B.. (2004). The Scale Politics of Emerging Diseases. Osiris, 19, 62–76. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655232&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' elicited a major response by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by shedding light on the [[Ebola Zaire|Ebola Zaire outbreak]]. The release of teams of experts was immediate and massive. Many countries tightened their borders, issued warnings to custom officials, quarantined travelers, and issued travel advisories.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar, S.. (1998).

In his [[blurb]], horror writer [[Stephen King]] called the first chapter, "one of the most horrifying things I've read in my whole life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/richardpreston/bookshelf/hz.html | title=About The Hot Zone | publisher=Random House | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether any book "scared the pants off you" writer [[Suzanne Collins]] answered, "''The Hot Zone'', by Richard Preston. I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/08/12/suzanne-collins-on-the-books-she-loves/ | title=Suzanne Collins on the books she loves | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=Aug 12, 2010 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Jordan, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has received criticism for sensationalizing the effects of Ebola virus.  In their memoir ''Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC |isbn=978-0760712085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; former CDC scientists [[Joseph B. McCormick]] and [[Susan Fisher-Hoch]] lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact.  McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Adaptations==

===Failed film adaptation===
In January 1993, [[20th Century Fox]] and producer [[Lynda Obst]] won a bidding war for the film rights to Preston's 1992 ''New Yorker'' article, which was being transitioned into the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/fox-obst-contract-virus-pic-103313/ | title=Fox, Obst contract virus pic | publisher=Variety | date=January 24, 1993 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Eller, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to being outbid, [[Warner Bros.]] producer [[Arnold Kopelson]] immediately began working on the similarly themed ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'', a competing film which would ultimately be a factor leading to the collapse of ''Crisis in The Hot Zone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/virus-pic-fever-infects-fox-wb-118266/ | title=Virus pic fever infects Fox, WB | publisher=Variety | date=February 13, 1994 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=O'Steen, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors considered for the film adaptation included [[Wolfgang Petersen]] (who would later direct ''Outbreak''), [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], and [[Ridley Scott]].  Scott eventually signed on to direct the film in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 14, 1994 |title=Ridley Scott has signed on to direct "Crisis in the Hot Zone" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=February 14, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screenwriter James V. Hart was also signed to adapt the book.  In late-April 1994, Fox announced they had signed [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2, 1994 |title=Fox set the deals on "Crisis in the Hot Zone" for Robert Redford and Jodie Foster |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=May 2, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this version would ultimately not be made.  Foster dropped out of the film just before filming was to begin and production was delayed with [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sharon Stone]], and [[Robin Wright]] touted as possible replacements. In August 1994, Redford also dropped out of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 15, 1994 |title=Robert Redford has departed 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone." |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-15-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 15, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days following Redford's departure, it was announced that pre-production had been shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 19, 1994 |title="Crisis" in the Not Zone |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 19, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
On October 16, 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Ridley Scott again plans to adapt the book, this time as a [[television miniseries]] for [[NatGeo]]. [[Kelly Souders]], [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]], and [[Jeff Vintar]] wrote the pilot.  [[Julianna Margulies]] is starring as Nancy Jaax.  Filming begins in September 2018.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ebola-tv-series-works-lynda-741457 | title=Ebola TV Series in the Works From Lynda Obst, Ridley Scott (Exclusive) | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynda Obst will again produce the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/thank-the-ebola-outbreak-ridley-scott-will-finally-mak-1648330513 | title=20 Years Too Late, Ridley Scott's Finally Adapting The Hot Zone | publisher=IO 9 | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Trendacosta, Katharine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Judgement''''' is a [[triptych]] of [[oil paintings]] by the British artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], created in 1851–1854.  The work comprises three separate paintings on a theme of the [[Eschatology|end of the world]], inspired by the [[Book of Revelation]].  The paintings are generally considered to be among Martin's most important works, and have been described by some art critics as his [[masterpiece]].

The paintings were Martin's last major works before his death in 1854.  They were exhibited to the public from the time of his death until the 1870s to advertise the sale of prints from engravings of the works, being displayed in galleries and exhibition halls all over the UK, in New York in 1856–7 and in Australia in 1878–79. It has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during their extensive tours.

Martin's style of didactic expository art was rarely praised by art critics but remained popular with the public until the 1860s.  He fell out of style by the end of the 19th century, and his works were pigeonholed as Victorian and religious by the early 20th century.

Critical opinion of Martin's work improved from the 1940s, and the [[Tate Gallery]] bought ''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'' in 1945.  The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank.  The paintings were the cornerstone of the first substantial exhibition of Martin's works at the [[Tate Britain]] in 2011–12, with a theatrical [[son et lumière (show)|son et lumière]] show dramatising the manner of their exhibition in Victorian Britain.

==''The Last Judgement''==
The first element of the triptych, ''The Last Judgement'', is the central piece, intended to be displayed between the peaceful landscape of ''The Plains of Heaven'' to the left and the turbulent scene in ''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'' to the right.  It combines elements of both, with a crowd of "saved" people to the left, and of the "damned" to the right, with the heavenly host above.  A drawing in pencil and ink, signed and dated 1845, shows that this work was planned before Martin decided to paint a triptych, and Martin had started work on the painting by the end of 1849.  Painted in oil on canvas, it measures {{convert|196.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|325.7|cm|in}}.  

The work reflects the text of the Book of Revelation, which states that the [[Book of Judgement]] is sealed with [[seven seals]], and describes the events that take places as each seal is broken.  The breaking of the sixth seal triggers "the great day of his wrath" depicted in the second painting, followed by the last judgement after the seventh seal is broken.

According to chapter 4 of the Book of Revelation, "a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne ... and round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold"; in chapter 8, "four of the seven angels who have sounded their trumpets after the opening of the seventh seal", and "an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe ... to the inhabitors of the earth."; in chapter 9, a star falls from heaven and creates a [[abyss (religion)|bottomless pit]]: "and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace". The armies of [[Gog and Magog]], "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea" are mentioned in chapter 20, and paradise is referred to in chapter 21: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".

In the background of the painting is the [[Celestial City]], [[Jerusalem]], drawing elements from Martin's earlier historical and architectural paintings, with the [[Plains of Heaven]] behind.  The light of God pervades the work, with Christ sitting in judgement on the [[Throne of God]] in the centre, accompanied by 24 seated elders.  Four angels sound trumpets after the opening of the [[seventh seal]].

Below, a yawning chasm divides mankind into two parts: the "saved" are assembled on [[Mount Zion]] at God's right hand (that is, on the viewer's left) and the damned are gathered on the right.  The virtuous men, women and children of the saved include portraits of around 40 famous people, many of which are painted on slips of paper that were pasted onto the canvas like a [[collage]], awaiting their turn to appear before the throne.   An engraved key was published in 1855 identifying the principal figures among the saved, including many artists, writers and scientists such as [[Thomas More]], [[John Wesley|Wesley]], [[Cnut the Great|Canute]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[James Watt|Watt]].

The damned include richly dressed women, notably [[Salome]] daughter of [[Herodias]], and the [[whore of Babylon]], and also lawyers and clergymen, including a bishop and a pope.  A railway train with carriages labelled "London" and "Paris" tumbles into the bottomless pit.  The forces of [[Satan]] are being defeated, with the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] also falling into the abyss. 

The painting shows the time when "Heaven and Earth are passing away, and all things are made new."  According to Mary L. Pendered's 1923 book ''John Martin, Painter: His Life and Times'', Martin originally intended to call the painting ''All Things Made New''.

The painting was retained by Martin's family after his death until it was sold in 1935.  It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947, inherited by his wife Charlotte Frank in 1953, and left to the Tate Gallery in memory of her husband in 1974.

==''The Great Day of His Wrath''==
{{main|The Great Day of His Wrath}}

The second work in the triptych, ''The Great Day of His Wrath'', was intended to be hung to the right of ''The Last Judgement'', and continues the theme of destruction and damnation depicted on the right side of the central image.

The Book of Revelation describes a scene that is painted by Martin: "... and, lo, there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."   The collapsing pile of rocks to the right of the painting are the buildings of an entire city falling into an abyss.

The oil on canvas work measures {{convert|196.5|cm|in}} by {{convert|303.2|cm|in}}.  It was bought by the Tate Gallery in 1945.

==''The Plains of Heaven''==
The third work in the triptych, ''The Plains of Heaven'' was intended to be hung to the left of ''The Last Judgement'', and continues the pastoral landscape occupied by the "saved" on the left side of the central image.

The landscape resembles the Italian views painted by [[J. M. W. Turner]], with serene open vistas of greenery.  Martin painted similar landscapes in watercolours around 1850; examples include ''The Traveller'' and ''Joshua spying out the Land of Canaan''.  The scene resembles Martin's 1841 painting of ''The Celestial City and River of Bliss''.

The oil on canvas work measures {{convert|198.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|306.7|cm|in}}. Along with ''The Last Judgement'', the painting was left to the Tate on the death of Charlotte Frank in 1974, in memory of her husband Robert Frank.

==Reception==
Martin signed an agreement with the publisher and printseller [[Thomas Maclean]] in June 1851, under which Martin's painting ''The Great Day of His Wrath'' would be [[engraving|engraved]] and the painting would be exhibited to publicise subscriptions for the print. Maclean was to retain two thirds of the net profits from the print, with Martin receiving one third.  The painting was sent to the engraver, [[Charles Mottram]], by the end of 1851.  Martin probably started work on the second and third paintings before the end of 1851, and a second agreement for their engraving was signed on 23 June 1852.

Martin suffered a [[stroke]] in November 1853, and died on 17 February 1854.  Seven days earlier, the pictures were first exhibited together in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where they were shown at the Victoria Rooms in Grey Street from 10 February to 4 March 1854 (''The Last Judgement'' had been put on display on its own at Maclean's gallery in London in June 1853).  The paintings were accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet, a technique that Martin has used with his earlier Biblical pictures.  The paintings went on an extensive tour of provincial cities, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, York, Hull, Leeds, Oxford, Birmingham, Liverpool, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Leicester, Bristol and Chester.  There was initially some suggestion that the paintings were unfinished, but they were signed by Martin and he had consented to the tour, although Maclean had considerable rights over them under his agreement with Martin. The painting were exhibited in London in May 1855, at the [[Hall of Commerce]] at 52 [[Threadneedle Street]].

''[[The Morning Post]]'' of 3 May 1855 greatly admired them: 'the simple grandeur of the conception, the broad artistic arrangement, and the wonderfully inventive faculty in detail. ..will serve to place the fame of Martin in a much higher position than any of his former labours'.

The paintings visited Dublin in March 1856, and the United States in 1857.  The Mottram [[mezzotint]] engravings were finally published in 1857, in New York and London.  The paintings were back in London in 1860, at [[Mabley's]] in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].  Tours of Britain continued for more than a decade, with the last recorded exhibition in Hexham in 1872.  They were exhibited in Australia in 1878-9, where they were shown in at a gallery in Melbourne and were included unofficially in the British Court at the [[Sydney International Exhibition]].  [[Sydney International Exhibition (1879)]]

It has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during the extensive tours.

==Ownership==
The ownership of the paintings after Martin's death remains unclear.  They are not mentioned in his will, and the agreement with Maclean (which gave Mclean two thirds of the profits from the sale of prints, and the right to use the paintings to market the prints) meant that they were on tour for decades.  It seems likely that they were bequeathed to a cousin, Maria Thompson, who had married the son of the Thomas Wilson, his host during his regular visits to the Isle of Man and who nursed him in his final illness.  There was also a family connection - the Thomas Wilson was married to the sister of Martin's wife.

The works remained in the extended Wilson-Martin family - in the possession of the artist's son Charles by about 1872 - and his son Thomas Carew Hunt Martin lent the paintings for an exhibition at [[Earls Court]] in 1897. They were repeatedly put up for sale by auction but there were no buyers.  By the 1890s, they were displayed "in a dingy room" at [[Alexandra Palace]], and then on the staircase at the [[Dore Gallery]] from around 1900 to the 1920s.  By 1923, they had been taken out of their frames and were rolled up and stored in a warehouse.  They were sold at auction in 1935 for £7 by [[Rex Nan Kivell]], manager of the [[Redfern Gallery]].  The Tate bought ''The Great Day of his Wrath'' from Kivnell in 1945.  After the sale, ''The Last Judgement'' was cut into four strips to decorate a screen.  It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947 and restored.  Frank also acquired ''The Plains of Heaven''.  The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank.

[[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Layer Monument with four Northern Mannerist figurines]]
'''The Layer Quaternity''' are four marble sculpture figurines approximately {{convert|25|cm|0}} in height located on the two columns of [[the Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century polychrome mural monument ({{convert|320 x 350|cm|disp=sqbr}}) which was installed in the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]] to the memory of [[Christopher Layer (merchant)|Christopher Layer]] (1531–1600).

==Style== 
The quartet of figurines sculptured in marble, ''Pax, Gloria, Vanity, Labor'' exhibit primary thematic concerns and stylistic attributes of [[Northern Mannerist]] art, namely, portraiture of animated human movement, variety and multiplicity, often set in the Classical or mythological world, and inclined towards esoteric concepts.&lt;ref&gt; [[John Shearman]] Mannerism Pelican 1967 {{ISBN|0-14-020808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of symbolism== 
[[File:Alchemical air 1606.jpg|thumb|right| 'The Philosopher's Stone' from 'Alchemia' (1606) Libavius]]
The Layer Quaternity (''circa'' 1598–1604) share a number of iconographical details to a complex illustration found in ''Alchemia'' (1606) by the German academic [[Andreas Libavius]] in a chapter entitled ''De Lapide Philosophorum'' ([[Philosopher's stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]) in which two giants support four figures, the lower pair of which are mortal, the upper pair immortal, they form the apex to –

"Libavius' monument of the opus.......The completion of the Little Work by ''Labor and Industry'' and ''the grace of God'' (Latin lower captions translated) is followed by ''Sol'' and ''Luna'' ascending on swan's wings.....the thanksgiving by the Arab king and his white wife reading as – ''Glory to God on High'' and ''I will exalt thee my God'' ".&lt;ref&gt; Alchemy – Johannes Fabricius pub. Rosenkilde and Bagger, Copenhagen, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin upper captions translated)

Libavius' illustration and the marble sculpture of the Layer Quaternity share an identical pairing including a naked figure (lower pair), a bare-legged royal male and a regal draped female (upper pair) as well as the titled captions ''Gloria'' and ''Labor'', along with the symbols of palm branch, ''rotundum'', and moon. 

The similarities between the captioned phrases of Libavius' illustration to those of the single-word titles of the Layer Quaternity suggest that in time sequence, the Layer monument was based upon and installed before 1606, the publication date of Libavius' illustration.

Biblical verse which parallels the symbolism of each captioned entity includes for the lower and mortal pair – ''Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the '''Labour''' that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was '''Vanity''' and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun''. [[Ecclesiastes]] 2.v.11 With an antithetical response from the upper, immortal, ''Heavenly'' pair –  '''Glory''' ''to God in the highest, and on earth '''Peace''', goodwill to all men.'' [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2 v.14

The Layer Quaternity also corresponds to the alchemical 'deities' [[Apollo]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] as named in emblem XVII of [[Atalanta Fugiens]] (1617) by the German alchemist-physician [[Michael Maier]].&lt;ref&gt; J.B. Craven Count [[Michael Maier]] Life and Writings 1910 reprint 2003 Ibis Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The four figurines housed in the monument's pilasters, ''Pax'' and ''Gloria'', ''Vanitas'' and ''Labor'', (Peace, Glory, Vanity, Labor) are relatively rare examples of Northern Mannerist sculpture extant in Britain. Collectively they exemplify how Christian iconography during the era of [[Elizabeth I]], in tandem with Renaissance Europe, integrated symbolism from the western esoteric traditions of alchemy and astrology into works of art, including the funerary monument. The Layer Quaternity in their totality are a unique alchemical mandala.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam McLean]] The Alchemical Mandala pub. Phanes 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Through polarised symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). They also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, as well as pleasure and suffering. In essence, the Layer Quaternity, not unlike the ''Scaiolae''&lt;ref&gt; 'Spiritual powers of the mind comparable to psychic powers such as thought, love, hate, imagination, hope, fear'. C.G.Jung CW 13:206 citing [[Martin Ruland the Younger|Martin Ruland]],'They emanate from the soul in man. Fancy, imagination, speculative faculty, etc. are included under the term.' – from ''Lexicon Alchemiae'' (1612)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Paracelsus]] (which are discussed by Libavius in ''Alchemia'') are a quaternity of differentiated virtues or psychic entities which represent a complete wholeness or totality in sum.

==Psychological associations==

The role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed at length by [[Carl Gustav Jung]]. Much of his in-depth study and observations upon the function and role of the quaternity in religious symbolism is applicable to the Layer Quaternity. To Jung the quaternity was a natural expression of differentiation which always represents a totality, citing the four elements, the four seasons, the ancient Greek schemata of the [[four humours]], and the [[four temperaments]], as well as the four Evangelists with their respective emblems in the form of the [[tetramorph]] in Christian iconography, as examples.  

The symbolism of the four entities of the Layer Quaternity exemplify Jung's observation that individuation develops through psychic qualities consisting of two pairs of opposites, which are often polarised to each other.&lt;ref&gt; C.G. Jung 'The Quaternio and the mediating role of Mercurius' 

CW 14 para. 5 – 13 pub. RKP 1955
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung 'The Quaternity of the Homo Maximus' 

CW 13 para. 206 -209 pub. RKP 1968

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G.Jung 'The Philosophical Tree'(1954) 3.The Tetrasomia CW 13 para. 358-68 RKP 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; C.G. Jung 'The Concept of the Quaternity' CW 11 para. 243 – 267 and CW 11 para. 268 -279 pub. RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the Layer Quaternity may be viewed as exemplary of Renaissance-era psychology. Its four highly-symbolic figurine entities are simultaneously, a 'map' of the psyche, and a highly-original alchemical [[mandala]] in western funerary art.&lt;ref&gt;The Layer Monument: An introduction and interpretation as an alchemical mandala.

==Plot==
On John Conroy's property, the 2-year-old colts and fillies are mustered and brought to the homestead for [[horse breaking]]. Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt from the famous racehorse Regret (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds (£1000) and that he wants the colt to eventually be the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] horse for the property).

Jim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both.

Jim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]], both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[Station (Australian agriculture)#Personnel|station hands]], with Dan Mulligan (the leading hand), disdainfully commenting "''We don't want any [[Swagman|swagmen]] here''". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make [[Wiktionary:disparaging|disparaging]] remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a [[Mark Foy's]] catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a [[Animal glue|glue factory]].

John Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.

During the night, the [[Brumby]] herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the stations near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning.

The crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including Harrison, who made his fortune when Pardon won the cup (a reference to the President's Cup, a lesser known race held in Manindie, New South Wales). Another crack rider at the homestead was [[Clancy of the Overflow]] (who was a friend of Jim). Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride.

The Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with [[wombat]] holes (burrows, where a horse could break a leg), all riders stop short of the dangerous descent &amp;mdash; apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd (including the colt) back to John Conroy's property.

John Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance, as well as a superb [[equestrianism|equestrian]] pageant, are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, and all ends happily.

==Notes about the musical==

Although also based on [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)]], the arena spectacular has no connection whatsoever with either the films or the television series of the same name.

[[Image:Arena Spectacular ad-Steve-Jefferys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve Jefferys]] and Ammo&lt;br /&gt;''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'' (advertisement)]]

===Screen images===
* The screen images, photographed by Ross Dunstan, were provided by [[Australian Geographic|Australian Geographic Pty Ltd]] and are featured in their book ''The Snowy Mountains''.

===Poetry===
* [[Steve Bisley]], in his role of [[Banjo Paterson|Banjo]], recites [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|the poem]] during Act II in the scene "The Ride &amp;mdash; parts 1&amp;ndash;4", as well as reciting other poems by Banjo Paterson. [[Bud Tingwell]], in his role of "John Conroy", also recited poems by Banjo Paterson.

===Horses, riders and drivers===
* ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'' had real horses performing in the show.
* During the opening sequence of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Steve Jefferys]] and his stock horse Ammo reprised their entrance at the beginning of the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony]]. Steve Jeffreys' wife Sandra Langsford also took part in both the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (in which she was one of the 140 riders) and also took part in ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', in which she was one of the featured crack riders (expert riders). Steve Jefferys and Sandra Langsford also trained Ammo (the rearing horse), and Drummond (the colt from old Regret), as well as training Jana, the Border Collie (Banjo Paterson's dog).
* For his horse riding role as Jim Ryan in the production of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Martin Crewes]], who could already ride, was given intensive riding lessons by expert riding teacher [[Steve Jefferys]], so that Crewes would not require a [[body double]] for the difficult riding feats he had to accomplish in the show. Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a [[horse whisperer]] for his role as Jim Ryan. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Outside the Arena &amp;ndash; Behind the Scenes'' &amp;mdash; extras section of the DVD release of the show&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was also superb riding, including intricate [[equestrianism|equestrian]] drill movements, and all of the animal actors ('Jana' the Border Collie, and the horses in the show) were magnificent. [[Horse riding stunts]] in the show were performed by trick riders and stunt riders, including Zelie Thompson and Deborah Brennan. The crack riders in the musical wore [[Akubra]] hats and [[Driza-Bone]] riding coats.
* The Horse Master for the show was Tony Jablonski, who had also been the Horse Master for the horse segment at the beginning of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
* A [[Cobb and Co]] stagecoach, pulled by five horses, was featured in the musical.
* Also featured were a couple of buckboards, with one of the buckboards being pulled by a mare, while the second buckboard was pulled by a gelding (the buckboard horses, which were very similar in colouring, though different in size, were mother and son).

===Whipcracking and ropes===
* Australia's [[whipcracking]] expert [[John Brady (showman)|John Brady]] demonstrated his expertise with both [[stockwhip]]s and rope tricks within the show, as well as appearing in the show in the role of Saltbush.

'''''The Music''''' (also known as ''The Music Group'', [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Muzyka'', ''Grupa Muzyka'') is one of three sculptures&lt;ref&gt;Except ''Music'' there are also ''Fine Arts'' and ''Theatre'' groups.&lt;/ref&gt; located on the roof of the building on Koszykowa Street 34/50 in [[Warsaw]] since 1952. The project was chosen after an artistic competition. The monument was designed by [[Józef Gosławski (Polish sculptor)|Józef Gosławski]], but his wife - [[Wanda Gosławska|Wanda]] - and his brother - [[Stanisław Gosławski|Stanisław]] - helped him with its realization because of the short deadline. Lack of scaffolds, problems with obtaining funds and the short deadline forced the artists&lt;ref&gt;Except Józef Gosławski sculptures in new Warsaw district were designed by [[Kazimierz Bieńkowski]] and [[Leon Machowski]].&lt;/ref&gt; to write a letter to the chief architect of Warsaw - Józef Sigalin. After that, the conditions were improved and work was completed on time.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anna Rudzka|date=July 2008|title=It's worth looking up...|journal=Zabytki.

The image of ''Music Group'' was on one of the postcards published in 1952. It cost 1.30 [[Polish złoty|zł]], of which 0.08 [[Polish złoty|zł]] was spent on ''The Social Fund of Reconstruction of Capital City''.&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt;

The '''United Paramount Network''' ('''UPN''') was an American [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]] that launched on January 16, 1995. The network was originally owned by [[Chris-Craft Industries]] and [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]]; [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through its [[Paramount Television]] unit, which produced most of the network's series) turned the network into a [[joint venture]] in 1996 after acquiring a 50% stake in the network, and subsequently purchased Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. In December 2005, UPN was spun off to [[CBS Corporation]] when Viacom split into two separate companies.

CBS Corporation and [[Time Warner]] jointly announced on January 24, 2006 that the companies would shut down UPN and competitor [[The WB]] to launch a new joint venture network later that year.&lt;ref name="UPN, WB merge"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN, WB to Merge Into CW Network|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|last=Crupi|first=Anthony|work=[[AdWeek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 24, 2006|accessdate=February 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064454/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN ceased broadcasting on September 15, 2006, with The WB following suit two days later.

==History==
===1949–1993: Origins of network===
[[Paramount Pictures]] had played a pivotal role in the development of network television. It was a partner in the [[DuMont Television Network]], and the Paramount Theaters chain, which was spun off from the corporate/studio parent, merged with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in a deal that helped cement that network's status as a major network. The [[Paramount Television Network]] was launched in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=82NT1nDUQ1oC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=paramount+Television+network+in+1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F2lqiHAwVW&amp;sig=bjSI1AONysTEHk5o8ThRUeVxzMA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjugumc4KfWAhVK4oMKHUSrBLc4ChDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramount%20Television%20network%20in%201949&amp;f=false|title=Superstations|publisher=PediaPress|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916052935/https://books.google.tn/books?id=82NT1nDUQ1oC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=paramount+Television+network+in+1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F2lqiHAwVW&amp;sig=bjSI1AONysTEHk5o8ThRUeVxzMA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjugumc4KfWAhVK4oMKHUSrBLc4ChDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramount%20Television%20network%20in%201949&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but dissolved in the 1950s.

In the wake of the successful [[Universal Studios]] ''[[ad hoc]]'' [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package ''[[Operation Prime Time]]'', which first featured a [[miniseries]] adaptation of [[John Jakes]]' novel ''The Bastard'' and went on to air several more productions, Paramount had earlier contemplated its own television network with the [[Paramount Television Service]]. Set to launch in early [[1978 in television|1978]], it would have run its programming for only one night a week. Thirty "Movies of the Week" would have followed ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' on Saturday nights. Plans for the new network were scrapped when sufficient advertising slots could not be sold, though Paramount would contribute some programs to ''Operation Prime Time'', such as the mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'', and the weekly pop music program, ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''. ''Star Trek: Phase II'' was reworked as the theatrical film, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', absorbing the costs already incurred from the aborted television series.

Paramount, and its eventual parent [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (which bought the studio's then-parent, Paramount Communications, in 1994), continued to consider launching their own television network. [[Independent station (North America)|Independent station]]s, even more than [[network affiliate]]s, were feeling the growing pressure of audience erosion to [[cable television]] in the 1980s and 1990s; there were unaffiliated commercial [[television station]]s in most of the major television markets, even after the foundation of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1986. Meanwhile, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], which had long been successful in syndication with repeats of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', launched several first-run syndicated series by the 1990s, including ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'', ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.

In 1993, [[Time Warner]] and [[Chris-Craft Industries]] entered into a [[joint venture]] to distribute programs via a [[prime time]] programming service, the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (PTEN). PTEN can be seen as the ancestor of both UPN and [[The WB]]:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Chris-Craft later became a partner in UPN, and Time Warner launched The WB in a joint venture with the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] at roughly the same time.

Paramount formed the [[Paramount Stations Group]] in 1991 when it purchased the assets of the [[TVX Broadcast Group]], which owned several independent stations in major markets. This was not unlike the purchase of the [[Metromedia]] stations by [[News Corporation]] five years earlier, which were used as the nuclei for Fox. In another parallel, [[20th Century Fox]] (the News Corporation subsidiary behind the FOX network, which was spun off with the company's other entertainment assets to [[21st Century Fox]] in July 2013), like Paramount, had long been a powerhouse in television syndication. All indicators suggested that Paramount was about to launch a network of its own.

On October 27, 1993, Paramount and Chris-Craft announced the formation of a new television network, later to be named the '''United Paramount Network''', with initial plans to run two hours of programming in prime time for two nights per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paramount Plans a TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/business/paramount-plans-a-tv-network.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 27, 1993|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094915/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/business/paramount-plans-a-tv-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new network would be owned by [[Chris-Craft Industries]], while most of its shows were to be produced by [[Paramount Television]].

Originally, the network was to simply be called "U", but the "U Network" trademark was held by the now-defunct [[National Association of College Broadcasters]] (NACB), which had been operating a satellite television programming network featuring largely college student-produced programs since 1991. The founder and first head of UPN, [[Lucie Salhany]], approached NACB with an offer of US$50,000 to transfer the name. Due to the costs related to rebranding the student network, and under the advice of its then-volunteer legal counsel, Mr. Cary Tepper, the non-profit association countered with a request of $100,000, which Ms. Salhany refused. Ultimately, the "U" in UPN stood for Chris-Craft subsidiary [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]], which owned the network's two largest stations, [[WWOR-TV]] in [[New York City]] and [[KCOP-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]; the "P" represented Paramount Television, the studio that formed a programming partnership with Chris-Craft to create the network. Chris-Craft and Paramount/Viacom each owned independent stations in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities, and these stations formed the nuclei of the new network.

UPN launched on January 16, 1995, initially carrying programming only on Monday and Tuesday nights from 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 2 Would-Be Networks Get Set for Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 9, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094720/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first telecast, the [[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|two-hour pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', was an auspiciously widely viewed start – being watched by 21.3 million viewers; however, ''Voyager'' would never achieve such viewership levels again, nor would any of the series debuting on UPN's second night of broadcasting survive the season. In contrast, The WB debuted one week earlier, on January 11, with four series – only one of which, ''[[Muscle (TV series)|Muscle]]'', would not survive its first season. The first comedy series to debut on UPN were ''[[Platypus Man]]'', starring [[Richard Jeni]], and ''[[Pig Sty]]'', with both shows airing Monday nights in the 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour; both received mixed reviews, and neither lasted long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN Network Cancels 3 of Its 4 Programs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/arts/upn-network-cancels-3-of-its-4-programs.html|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094847/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/arts/upn-network-cancels-3-of-its-4-programs.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early UPN programs included the action series ''[[Nowhere Man (TV series)|Nowhere Man]]'', starring [[Bruce Greenwood]] and ''[[Marker (TV series)|Marker]]'', starring [[Richard Grieco]]; the comic western ''[[Legend (TV series)|Legend]]'' starring [[Richard Dean Anderson]]; the science-fiction themed action series, ''[[The Sentinel (TV series)|The Sentinel]]''; and ''[[Moesha]]'', a sitcom starring [[Brandy (entertainer)|Brandy Norwood]]. Of the network's early offerings, only ''Star Trek: Voyager'', ''Moesha'' and ''The Sentinel'' would last longer than one season. As a result of the lack of viewership, UPN operated on a loss and had lost $800 million by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Won't Anyone Pull the Plug on UPN?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/04/03/2000_04_03_032_TNY_LIBRY_000020545|author=James Surowiecki|periodical=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=April 3, 2000|accessdate=January 17, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218170110/https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/04/03/2000_04_03_032_TNY_LIBRY_000020545|archivedate=December 18, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nearly two years of the network's launch, on December 8, 1996, Paramount/Viacom purchased a 50% stake in UPN from Chris-Craft for approximately $160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VIACOM BUYS 50 PERCENT STAKE IN UPN NETWORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/05/business/viacom-buys-50-percent-stake-in-upn-network.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 5, 1996|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094516/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/05/business/viacom-buys-50-percent-stake-in-upn-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom to buy half of UPN: is investing $160 million in fledgling network|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18935896.html|author=Steve McClellan|author2=Lynette Rice|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=December 9, 1996|accessdate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011162936/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18935896.html|archivedate=October 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fox had done nine years earlier, UPN started with a few nights of programming each week, with additional nights of primetime shows gradually being added over the course of several seasons. Because of this, UPN's affiliates were basically independent stations for all intents and purposes during the network's early years, with these stations airing either syndicated programs or movies during primetime on nights when the network did not provide programming. The first expansion of its prime time lineup came with the addition of programming on Wednesday nights on March 6, 1996 (during the second half of the 1995–96 season); that expansion also saw UPN assume the broadcast rights to the [[Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]], which aired its inaugural broadcast on CBS the year prior.

UPN ordered 36 science fiction films to air as part of its weekly movie presentations beginning in 1998; the films were supplied by four production companies, with most of the titles coming from Paramount. Some titles would be shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] first, which allowed the [[pay television|premium cable channel]] to cooperate in advertising the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segrave|first1=Kerry|title=Movies at home : how Hollywood came to television|date=1999|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.]|isbn=0786406542|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTehB3M1_kC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 8, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624054459/https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTehB3M1_kC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=June 24, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPN completed its prime time expansion in the 1998–99 season, with Thursdays and Fridays as the last nights of programming to be added to the network's evening slate. That season saw the debut of ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'', a sitcom set during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that centered on a black English nobleman who becomes the valet to [[Abraham Lincoln]]; even before its debut, the series was riddled by controversy and protests from several African American activist groups (including the Los Angeles chapter of the [[NAACP]], who picketed outside [[Paramount Studios]] one week before the originally scheduled [[television pilot|pilot episode]]) and some advertisers for its perceived lighthearted take on [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery in the 19th century]], protested against the premise of the series. Despite what publicity ''Desmond'' received from its controversial topicality, the series suffered from low ratings (with the first episode on October 5, 1998, placing 116th out of 125 programs aired that week on network television) and was cancelled after four episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism Is Not 'Diary's' Crime|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/02/entertainment/ca-28389|author=Howard Rosenberg|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 2, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094649/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/02/entertainment/ca-28389|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Candy Maker Pulls Its Ads From Controversial Comedy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/business/fi-32006|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 13, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094959/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/business/fi-32006|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=300 Protest at Studio Against TV Comedy Set in Slavery Era|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/01/local/me-28286|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 1, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094615/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/01/local/me-28286|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They Vote by Remote: As UPN debuts 'Desmond Pfeiffer,' viewers tune in other channels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/07/entertainment/ca-29945|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094510/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/07/entertainment/ca-29945|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Desmond Pfeiffer' Is Deep-Sixed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/07/entertainment/ca-40123|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=November 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094549/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/07/entertainment/ca-40123|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999-2005: Viacom era and decline===
[[Image:Paramount networklogo.jpg|225px|thumb|Proposed logo for the stillborn Paramount Network.]]
Six months after the company announced its $36 billion merger with (the original) [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in March 1999, Viacom exercised a contractual clause that would – within a 45-day grace period – force Chris-Craft to either buy Viacom out of UPN, or have the former sell its ownership stake in the network to Viacom. Three days later on February 8, Chris-Craft subsequently filed a lawsuit against Viacom in the [[New York Supreme Court]] to block the latter's merger with CBS, claiming that a pact signed between the two partners in 1997 had prevented either from owning "any interest, financial or otherwise" in "any competing network," including CBS, for a four-year period through January 2001. On March 17, New York Supreme Court judge Herman Cahn ruled against Chris-Craft's move for a permanent [[injunction]] to curtail the Viacom-CBS merger and the enforcement of Viacom's ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viacom Makes 2 Offers to BHC on TV Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/business/viacom-makes-2-offers-to-bhc-on-tv-venture.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 4, 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103205351/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/business/viacom-makes-2-offers-to-bhc-on-tv-venture.html|archivedate=November 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BHC Sues UPN Partner Viacom Over CBS Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/09/business/fi-62554|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=February 9, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095028/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/09/business/fi-62554|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris-Craft Loses UPN Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/business/chris-craft-loses-upn-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 17, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095032/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/business/chris-craft-loses-upn-ruling.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to find a suitable partner, on March 20, Chris-Craft allowed Viacom to buy out its 50% stake for $5 million, giving Viacom full control of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viacom Buys Chris-Craft's Stake in UPN For $5 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/21/business/viacom-buys-chris-craft-s-stake-in-upn-for-5-million.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 21, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095156/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/21/business/viacom-buys-chris-craft-s-stake-in-upn-for-5-million.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom wins UPN so let the digestion begin|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|periodical=[[Media Life Magazine]]|date=March 2000|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617235807/http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|archivedate=June 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN deal done; Viacom buys out Chris-Craft share|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62239976.html|author=Melissa Grego|author2=Joe Schlosser|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 10, 2000|accessdate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025706/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62239976.html|archivedate=June 11, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave UPN the rare distinction of being one of the only broadcast networks to not have had [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&amp;O) in the three largest media markets, New York City, Los Angeles and [[Chicago]] (with The WB – the only network never to have had an O&amp;O – being the only other, as minority owner [[Tribune Broadcasting]] owned most of its charter affiliates including those in [[WPIX|all]] [[KTLA|three]] [[WGN-TV|markets]], while majority owner Time Warner only owned [[WPCH-TV|an independent station]] that originated then-[[superstation]] [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]). With Viacom taking full ownership control of UPN, KCOP-TV and WWOR-TV lost their statuses as O&amp;Os and automatically became affiliates of the network, with the network's largest owned-and-operated station becoming [[Philadelphia]] outlet [[WPSG]] (now the flagship station of [[The CW]]). In addition, neither Chris-Craft or Viacom had ever held ownership of Chicago affiliate [[WPWR-TV]], which had been the largest UPN station that was not owned-and-operated by the network prior to the Viacom buyout.

Shortly afterward, Viacom shortened the network's official name from the "United Paramount Network" to the three-letter initialism, "UPN". Viacom also proposed a rebranding of UPN into the "'''Paramount Network'''", using a prototype logo based on Paramount Pictures' mountain logo, which served as the basis for the "P" triangle in the network's original logo that was used until September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media Talk; UPN Will Become Paramount Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/business/media-talk-upn-will-become-paramount-network.html|author=Jim Rutenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 31, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094613/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/business/media-talk-upn-will-become-paramount-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN Network Will Carry On Without Its 'U'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/entertainment/ca-59125|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 26, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094628/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/entertainment/ca-59125|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN's Name in 2001: Paramount Network|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/business/fi-59235|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 26, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095147/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/business/fi-59235|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was abandoned after many affiliates protested, citing that the rebranding might confuse viewers and result in ratings declines, along with the costs of rebranding their stations with a new image and new network (and possible call sign changes); the "Paramount Network" branding was eventually used for the re-branding of the [[Paramount Network|pay-TV channel]] that launched as "The Nashville Network", then became "The National Network", then "The New TNN", &amp; finally "Spike TV" before being shortened to simply "Spike".

Viacom's purchase of [[CBS]] a few months before (which resulted in the merger of that network's owned-and-operated stations into Viacom's Paramount Stations Group unit), created duopolies between CBS and UPN stations in Philadelphia ([[KYW-TV]] and WPSG), [[Boston]] ([[WBZ-TV]] and [[WSBK-TV]]), [[Miami]] ([[WFOR-TV]] and [[WBFS-TV]]), [[Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]] ([[KTVT]] and [[KTXA]]), [[Detroit]] ([[WWJ-TV]] and [[WKBD-TV]]) and [[Pittsburgh]] ([[KDKA-TV]] and [[WPCW|WNPA]]). Viacom's purchase of CBS was said to be the "death knell" for the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s longtime ban on [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|television station duopolies]]. Further transactions added [[San Francisco]] ([[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBHK]], the latter of which was traded to Viacom/CBS by [[Fox Television Stations]]) and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] ([[KOVR]] and [[KMAX-TV]], the former of which was sold to Viacom/CBS by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]) to the mix.

At the time of UPN's launch, the network's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] was Chris-Craft-owned WWOR-TV in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] (which serves the New York City market). Even after Chris-Craft sold its share in the network to Viacom, WWOR was still commonly regarded as the flagship of the network since it had long been common practice for this status to be associated with a network's New York station. For this reason, some doubt was cast on UPN's future after Fox Television Stations bought most of Chris-Craft's television stations for $5.5 billion on August 12, 2000, which included several UPN affiliates (including WWOR and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] flagship KCOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox in the UPN house|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-upn-house/87627|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=August 21, 2000|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112714/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-upn-house/87627|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox later bought the third-largest UPN affiliate, Chicago's WPWR-TV, through a separate deal with [[Newsweb Corporation]] for $450 million in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox duops in Chicago|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-duops-chicago/93050|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=June 30, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112703/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-duops-chicago/93050|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Takeover to Bring Changes to Chicago-Area Television Station|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90412674.html|author=Kathy Bergen|agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the uncertainty of the network's future following the Fox purchases, UPN reached four-year affiliation agreements with Fox Television Stations' nine UPN affiliates on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; NINE FOX-OWNED STATIONS WILL REMAIN UPN AFFILIATES|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/business/company-news-nine-fox-owned-stations-will-remain-upn-affiliates.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 25, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094741/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/business/company-news-nine-fox-owned-stations-will-remain-upn-affiliates.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, UPN entered into a public bidding war to acquire two series from The WB, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', from producing studio [[20th Century Fox Television]]. UPN eventually outbid The WB for the shows and aired them together on Tuesday nights until ''Roswell'' ended its run in 2002, ''Buffy'' ended its run the following year. New shows began to breathe life into the network starting in the fall of 2003 with ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and sitcom ''[[All of Us]]'' (which was produced by [[Will Smith|Will]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), followed up by the fall 2004 premiere of the mystery series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' and the fall 2005 premiere of the [[Chris Rock]]-produced and narrated sitcom ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''.

On June 14, 2005, Viacom announced that it would be split into two companies due to declining performance of the company's stock; both the original Viacom – which was renamed [[CBS Corporation]] – and a new company that took the [[Viacom]] name would be controlled by the original Viacom's parent [[National Amusements]] (controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]]).

On January 24, 2006, UPN parent CBS Corporation and [[Time Warner]], the majority owner of The WB, announced that they would shut down the two respective networks and launch a new broadcast network that would be operated as a joint venture between both companies, [[The CW]], which incorporated UPN and The WB's higher-rated programs with newer series produced exclusively for The CW. The new network immediately signed 10-year affiliation agreements with 16 stations affiliated with The WB (out of 19 stations that were affiliated with the network) that were owned by that network's part-owner, the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] – including stations in the coveted markets of [[WPIX|New York City]], [[KTLA|Los Angeles]] and [[WGN-TV|Chicago]] – and 11 UPN stations that were owned by CBS Corporation.&lt;ref name="UPN, WB merge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 24, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017035638/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Television Stations' nine UPN affiliates were passed over for affiliations as a result, and two days later, those stations removed all UPN branding from those stations and ceasing promotion of the network's programs. One month later on February 22, Fox announced the formation of [[MyNetworkTV]], a new network that would also debut in September 2006 that would use the company's soon-to-be former UPN affiliates as the nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next eight months, determinations were made as to which shows from the two networks would cross over to The CW, as well as which of UPN and The WB's affiliate stations would be selected to become affiliates of the new network. Programming-wise, six UPN shows – ''America's Next Top Model'' (which was the last surviving series from UPN that remained on The CW's schedule until it moved to [[VH1]] in 2016), ''Veronica Mars'', ''Everybody Hates Chris'', ''Girlfriends'', ''All of Us'' and ''WWE Smackdown'' – were chosen to move to The CW for its inaugural 2006–07 fall schedule.

UPN quietly went off the air on September 15, 2006, at 9:59 PM EDT, ending the network's existence after 11 years. Unlike The WB, which closed its operations two days later with a special called "[[The Night of Favorites and Farewells]]", there was no promotion of UPN's signing off; rather, the network merely faded to black at the end of a ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' telecast without any fanfare. However, the Fox-owned UPN stations disaffiliated from the network on August 31; as a result, UPN's last two weeks of programming did not air in ten markets where Fox owned a UPN affiliate that was set to become an owned-and-operated station of MyNetworkTV, when that network launched on September 5, along with other markets where the local UPN station affiliated with MyNetworkTV or terminated their UPN affiliation during the summer. ''WWE SmackDown'', however, aired in those markets on Tribune's WB stations, including those that would join The CW shortly afterward. Nevertheless, with the exception of ''SmackDown'', all of the programs that aired during the network's final three months were reruns. After the network's official closure, UPN's website was redirected to The CW website, and then to CBS's website.

On February 9, 2017, Viacom announced that cable television channel Spike would take on the new branding of the '''[[Paramount Network]]''' in early 2018, as the company switches to a focus on six prime networks with most of the company's backing and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/spike-the-paramount-network-renamed-viacom-rebranding-1201906611/|title=Spike President On Channel's Rebranding As The Paramount Network|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=February 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210055944/http://deadline.com/2017/02/spike-the-paramount-network-renamed-viacom-rebranding-1201906611/|archivedate=February 10, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the fourth attempt at creating a network entity with the Paramount name, after the ''ad hoc'' [[Paramount Television Network]] in the early age of television, the 1978 [[Paramount Television Service]], which was planned and never launched, and an attempt in 2000 by Viacom to rebrand the broadcast United Paramount Network as the Paramount Network alone after joint partner [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]] sold their interest back to Viacom after selling their television stations to [[Fox Television Stations]], an effort aborted after affiliate rejection. The name change officially took place on January 18, 2018.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by UPN}}
At the time of its shutdown, UPN ran only two hours of primetime network programming on Monday through Fridays (compared to the three primetime hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sundays offered by the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks]], ABC, NBC and CBS). UPN never carried any weekend primetime programming throughout the network's run (though it did offer children's programming on weekend mornings until 2003, and a movie package to its affiliates on weekend afternoons until 2000, when the latter was replaced with a two-hour repeat block of UPN programs); as a result, affiliates held the responsibility of programming their Saturday and Sunday evening schedules with syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week due to special programming, in the 8:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]) time period. This primetime scheduling allowed for many of the network's affiliates to air local newscasts during the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period.

Most of UPN's programming through the years was produced by [[Paramount Television]] or a Viacom-owned sister company ([[Viacom Productions]], [[Big Ticket Entertainment]], [[Spelling Television]] or [[CBS Productions]]). UPN's first official program was ''Star Trek: Voyager'', with the first comedy shows to debut being two short-lived series: the [[Richard Jeni]] [[Star vehicle|starring vehicle]] ''Platypus Man'' and ''Pig Sty''.

Other notable UPN programs during the network's existence included ''The Sentinel'', ''Moesha'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', ''WWE SmackDown'', ''America's Next Top Model'', ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]'', the ''Moesha'' spin-off ''[[The Parkers]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''Everybody Hates Chris'', and ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]''. In the summer of [[2005 in television|2005]], UPN aired ''[[R U the Girl]]'', in which [[R&amp;B]] group [[TLC (music)|TLC]] searched for a woman to join them on a new song. The network also produced some special programs, including 2001's ''[[Iron Chef USA]]''. Much of UPN's comedy programming between 1996 and 2006 (particularly those that aired as part of the network's Monday evening lineup) was largely aimed at [[African American]] audiences, with minor exceptions in shows such as ''Clueless'', ''[[DiResta]]'' and ''[[Head over Heels (U.S. TV series)|Head Over Heels]]''.

UPN occasionally acquired series cancelled by the other broadcast networks, including former WB series ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Roswell'' (both of which moved to UPN in 2001, ''Buffy'' was picked up after The WB chose not to renew it due to issues with license fees while ''Roswell'' joined UPN after that same network also cancelled the series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN makes bid for 'Buffy'|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/upn-makes-bid-for-buffy-1117795697/|author=Josef Adalian|author2=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=March 21, 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094820/http://variety.com/2001/tv/news/upn-makes-bid-for-buffy-1117795697/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former ABC series ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]]'' and ''[[The Hughleys]]''. The first program that UPN acquired from another network was ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'', which moved to the network from [[NBC]] (which cancelled the [[LL Cool J]] sitcom after its second season) in 1996. In its later years, as part of the network's desire to maintain its own identity with its own unique shows, UPN instituted a policy of "not picking up other networks' scraps", which was a strong argument when fan pressure was generated in 2004 for them to pick up ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' which had been dropped from The WB.

UPN aired only one regular sports event program: the much-hyped [[XFL]] in 2001, airing Sunday evening games as part of a package from co-creator and [[WWE]] founder [[Vince McMahon]], which also included what was then ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'', and the only time the network carried programming officially outside of weeknights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN kicks off Sundays with extreme football|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/upn-kicks-off-sundays-with-extreme-football-1117781880/|author1=Paula Bernstein|author2=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095006/http://variety.com/2000/tv/news/upn-kicks-off-sundays-with-extreme-football-1117781880/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN had planned to air a second season of the XFL in 2002, but it also demanded that ''SmackDown!'' be reduced by 30 minutes; McMahon did not agree to the change and the football league folded not long afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s sudden death for XFL|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/it-s-sudden-death-for-xfl-1117799155/|author=John Dempsey|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 12, 2001|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095130/http://variety.com/2001/tv/news/it-s-sudden-death-for-xfl-1117799155/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News programming===
Like Fox and The WB, UPN never aired national morning or evening [[newscast]]s; however, several of its affiliates and owned-and-operated stations did produce their own local news programs. Several UPN affiliates ran a local newscast in the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific (9:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain Time) timeslot at some point during or throughout their affiliations with the network; there were also a few stations that produced a weekday morning newscast, although early evening newscasts were largely absent on most of these stations. The UPN affiliate body had fewer news-producing stations in comparison to stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) and considerably fewer than Fox and especially The WB. In several markets, the local UPN affiliate either outsourced news programming to an NBC, ABC or CBS station in the market (either due to insufficient funds or studio space for production of their own newscasts, or in later years after the FCC permitted duopolies in markets with at least eight unique station owners in 2000, the station being operated through a legal duopoly or [[local marketing agreement|management agreement]] with a major network affiliate); other affiliates opted to carry syndicated programming in the hour following UPN's primetime programming lineup.

When the network launched in January 1995, UPN automatically gained six affiliates with functioning news departments through Chris-Craft/United Television and Viacom's respective affiliation deals with the network, all of those stations started their news operations as either [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] or during prior affiliations with other networks: WWOR-TV/Secaucus, New Jersey (New York City), KCOP-TV/Los Angeles, [[WKBD-TV]]/[[Detroit]], [[KPTV]]/[[Portland, Oregon]], [[KMSP-TV]]/[[Minneapolis]] and [[WTOG]]/[[Tampa, Florida]]. Two more stations would join them later on: [[KSTW]]/[[Seattle]], also owned by Viacom at the time, after it affiliated with UPN in 1997 through the reversal of a 1995 affiliation switch with CBS affiliate [[KIRO-TV]] (which also kept its news department as a UPN affiliate), and KMAX-TV/Sacramento, which joined UPN after being acquired by Viacom in 1998 and began producing newscasts shortly after its 1995 affiliation with The WB. KSTW and WTOG's news departments were shut down in 1998 due to cost-cutting measures mandated by Viacom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News not Paramount|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53395671.html|author=Dan Trigoboff|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155349/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53395671.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WTOG to shutter news operation|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/1998/07/06/daily5.html|newspaper=Tampa Bay Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=July 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095016/http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/1998/07/06/daily5.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of UPN's news-producing stations were owned by the two companies that formed the nuclei of the network's affiliate group; [[WUAB]]/[[Cleveland]], which started its news department in 1988, also continued its 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast as a UPN affiliate (it would begin producing newscasts for sister station [[WOIO|WOIO-TV]] in February 1995, after that station became a CBS affiliate; though WOIO eventually took over production of the newscast by 2002). [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] affiliate [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]] briefly continued its newscasts after switching to UPN from CBS in 1995, until [[WHP-TV]] began operating the station under a [[local marketing agreement]] that fall. [[WFTC]]/Minneapolis continued to produce a late evening newscast after [[Fox Television Stations]] (which acquired KMSP-TV through the Chris-Craft purchase, and converted it into a Fox O&amp;O) acquired the station from [[Clear Channel Communications]] and switched the station to UPN – it was moved to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to avoid competing with KMSP's 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast until the WFTC newscast was cancelled in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WFTC drops newscast at 10; KMSP adds it|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146555564.html|author=Deborah Caulfield Rybak|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|publisher=[[Glen Taylor|Star Tribune Media Company LLC]]|date=June 2, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924135521/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146555564.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of KPTV and KMSP, both of which are now Fox stations, none of the former UPN affiliates that produced newscasts during their affiliation with the network continue to maintain an independent news department – despite license requirements imposed by the station's 1983 transfer of its license to Secaucus, New Jersey from New York City to cover New Jersey issues, WWOR-TV, which continued to produce news programming after coming under common ownership with Fox O&amp;O [[WNYW]], shut down its news department in July 2013 and replaced its lone 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast with an outside produced program called ''Chasing New Jersey'', a move that resulted in calls by state politicians for the FCC to revoke Fox's license to operate the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox ends MY9 News, will replace it with an interview show|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/07/fox_ends_my9_news_will_replace.html|author=Alexi Friedman|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705174357/http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/07/fox_ends_my9_news_will_replace.html|archivedate=July 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criticism continues over WWOR's cancellation of N.J. newscast|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/criticism_continues_over_wwors_cancellation_of_nj_newcast.html|author=Peggy McGlone|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|publisher=Advance Publications|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Chasing New Jersey' news show fails to win over Channel 9 critics|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130709/NJNEWS/307090041/-Chasing-New-Jersey-news-show-fails-win-over-Channel-9-critics?nclick_check=1|author=Sergio Bichao|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229235444/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130709/NJNEWS/307090041/-Chasing-New-Jersey-news-show-fails-win-over-Channel-9-critics?nclick_check=1|archivedate=December 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KTTV]] took over production of sister station KCOP's newscasts in 2007, before discontinuing news programming on that station in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KCOP Cutting News From its Lineup|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kcop-cutting-news-from-its-lineup/101140|author=Kevin Eck|website=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Mediabistro Holdings]]|date=August 9, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922183955/http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kcop-cutting-news-from-its-lineup/101140|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KCOP to drop news from the lineup|url=http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2013/08/kcop_to_drop_news_from_th.php|author=Kevin Roderick|newspaper=LA Observed|date=August 10, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010103647/http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2013/08/kcop_to_drop_news_from_th.php|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; KMAX's news department has since been merged with that of KOVR although it still produces a morning newscast separate from that station.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|UPN Kids|Disney's One Too}}
When the network launched in January 1995, UPN debuted a weekend morning cartoon block called ''[[UPN Kids]]'' (later called "The UPN Kids Action Zone" during the 1998–99 season). In 1997, UPN added two teen-oriented series to the lineup with reruns of the syndicated ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' (based on the young adult book series by [[Francine Pascal]]) and a new series, ''[[Breaker High]]'' (which co-starred a then-unknown [[Ryan Gosling]]); both shows filled the weekday morning block for the 1997–98 season, while they were also included alongside the animated series on Sunday mornings. Unlike other networks, UPN gave its affiliates the option of running its weekend children's program block on either Saturdays or Sundays. In January 1998, the network entered into a deal with [[Saban Entertainment]] to program the Sunday morning block (with shows such as ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' joining the lineup).&lt;ref name="Disney talks called off"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN kids pick Nick, not Mouse|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/upn-kids-pick-nick-not-mouse-1117467104/|last=Hontz|first=Jenny|work=Variety|date=January 27, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211100554/http://variety.com/1998/biz/news/upn-kids-pick-nick-not-mouse-1117467104/|archivedate=December 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvel, Saban set kids shows for UPN|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/marvel-saban-set-kids-shows-for-upn-1117467216/|last=Katz|first=Richard|work=Variety|date=January 29, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115808/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/marvel-saban-set-kids-shows-for-upn-1117467216/|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN serves up superheroes|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-serves-up-superheroes-1117468038/|last=Katz|first=Richard|work=Variety|date=February 24, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094918/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-serves-up-superheroes-1117468038/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, UPN contracted the rights to the network's children's programming lineup to [[The Walt Disney Company]]; as a result, the teen-oriented and animated series were replaced with a new block called ''[[Disney's One Too]]'', which debuted on September 6, 1999, and featured select programs seen on ABC's ''[[ABC Kids (United States)#Disney's One Saturday Morning|Disney's One Saturday Morning]]'' lineup (such as ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'' and ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mouse brands UPN kidvid|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/mouse-brands-upn-kidvid-1117743063/|last=Pursell|first=Chris|work=Variety|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=August 17, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402212916/http://variety.com/1999/tv/news/mouse-brands-upn-kidvid-1117743063/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UPN affiliates at the network's launch were already airing [[The Disney Afternoon]], a block supplied by Disney-owned syndication distributor [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]]; however, that block would be discontinued in August 1997. The addition of ''Disney's One Too'' expanded UPN's children's program block back to two hours, running on Sunday mornings and weekday afternoons. In September 2002, ''[[Digimon: Digital Monsters]]'' moved to UPN from [[Fox Kids]], due to Disney's acquisition of Fox's children's program inventory as well as the Fox Family Channel, which was renamed [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#ABC Family|ABC Family]] the previous year. At the same time, the "One Too" branding was dropped from on-air usage due to the rebranding of ABC's Saturday morning lineup from ''One Saturday Morning'' to ''ABC Kids'' (although the block was unofficially referred to as ''Disney's Animation Weekdays'' outside the network). UPN subsequently chose not to renew its contract with Disney, with the network dropping all children's programming after August 31, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Drops UPN Programming Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/14/business/fi-rup14.6|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 14, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094902/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/14/business/fi-rup14.6|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN to ax Disney kids shows in fall|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1473784.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group|Hollinger International]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=February 15, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1473784.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left UPN as one of only two major broadcast networks that did not air a children's programming block, the other being Pax TV, which discontinued its ''Pax Kids'' lineup in 2000, before reviving children's programming as [[Ion Television]] through the 2007 launch of [[Qubo]]. Incidentally, UPN's successor The CW carried over the [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning lineup from fellow predecessor The WB, resulting in UPN affiliates that joined The CW in September 2006 carrying network-supplied children's programming for the first time since the ''One Too'' block ended.

Some Fox stations that declined to carry [[4Kids TV]] passed on that block to an affiliate of UPN or The WB, or an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], in order for the Fox affiliate to air general entertainment programming or local newscasts on Saturday mornings (for example, [[WFLD]] in [[Chicago]] moved the 4Kids TV schedule to co-owned then-UPN affiliate [[WPWR-TV]], while WFLD aired infomercials).

===Television movies===
{{Main|List of television films produced for UPN}}
During the late 1990s, UPN produced a number of [[television film|television movies]] under the umbrella brand ''Blockbuster Shockwave Cinema'', in conjunction with sponsor (and then-sister company) [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]], almost all of which were [[science fiction film]]s.

From UPN's inception until 2000, the network also offered a hosted movie series called the ''UPN Movie Trailer'' to its stations. The weekend block featured mostly older theatrically released action and comedy films, often those from the [[Paramount Pictures]] film library. The ''Movie Trailer'' block was discontinued in 2000 to give stations that opted for them room for a two-hour block of select UPN series that aired in primetime during the previous week. There were also three Paramount-branded blocks that aired on Viacom's UPN owned-and-operated stations between 1995 and 2000: the ''Paramount Teleplex'' as the main brand for movies at any given timeslot, the ''Paramount Prime Movie'' for primetime features, and the ''Paramount Late Movie'' for films airing in late night timeslots.

==Affiliates==
{{Main|List of former UPN affiliates}}
UPN had approximately 143 full-power owned-and-operated or primary affiliate stations in the U.S., and another 65 stations aired some UPN programming as secondary affiliates. Although it was considered a major network by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] for [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] purposes, UPN was not available in every American [[media market|television market]]. In some areas, UPN programming was shown off-pattern by affiliates of other networks (airing immediately after programming from their primary network on some Fox and WB stations, or during overnight timeslots on major network affiliates) or by otherwise independent stations, such as in the case of [[KIKU|KIKU-TV]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Some affiliates were also known to extensively preempt network programming in order to broadcast local sporting events.

By 2003, UPN had an estimated audience reach of 85.98% of all U.S. households (equivalent to 91,689,290 households with at least one television set). In contrast, The WB was viewable in 91.66% of all U.S. television homes. This is mainly because UPN did not have wide distribution in areas ranked below the top 100 Nielsen-designated media markets, whereas The WB operated [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] – a [[cable television|cable]]-only station group that was launched by the network in September 1998 – to provide broad coverage to those markets (from January 1995 to October 1999, The WB's programming was carried over the [[WGN America|superstation feed]] of the network's Chicago affiliate [[WGN-TV]] through a programming agreement with its owner Tribune Broadcasting). Despite the fact that UPN would not be able to have extensive small-market coverage at launch due to a lack of commercial television stations in those areas, Paramount Television denied [[Advance Publications|Advance Entertainment Corporation]] permission from distributing the network's programming over the [[WWOR EMI Service]], the [[superstation]] feed of New York City affiliate WWOR-TV, preventing the network from reaching markets without an exclusive or secondary UPN affiliate. The network proposed launching a cable-originated service to increase its distribution to markets without an over-the-air affiliate in July 1998; however, the service, which was to have been named UPN Plus, ultimately never launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN working on 24-hour cable channel|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-working-on-24-hour-cable-channel-1117478702/|author=John Dempsey|author2=Jenny Hontz|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=July 22, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094526/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-working-on-24-hour-cable-channel-1117478702/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN did have one cable-only affiliate in its station body, [[WNFM-TV]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Florida]], which joined the network in 1998.

In markets where Viacom had a CBS/UPN [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] after its 2000 merger with CBS, the UPN station was used to air CBS network programs in the event that local sporting events or extended [[breaking news]] coverage would air on the CBS station, sometimes resulting in UPN programs being pre-empted outright, as the CBS-owned outlets were usually the senior partner in the duopolies (an exception being [[Detroit]], where [[WKBD-TV]] is considered the senior partner to [[WWJ-TV]] due to WKBD being longer-established). One such event occurred on September 26, 2004, when [[Hurricane Jeanne]] forced a scheduled [[National Football League|NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Miami]] to be postponed from its scheduled start time of 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; the game aired locally on [[KDKA-TV]] and [[WFOR-TV]] while their respective UPN sister stations, [[WPCW|WNPA-TV]] and [[WBFS-TV]], aired CBS's regular Sunday night programming instead.

These factors led to the network struggling in the ratings over much of UPN's existence, with its later ''Star Trek'' franchise, ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', perhaps suffering the most and ultimately being cancelled by the network in a controversial decision in February 2005. The most consistent ratings performer for the network was ''[[WWE SmackDown]]''. During the 2004-2005 season, the network was getting consistently better ratings than The WB, much of this thanks to its carriage of the WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UPN's Start-of-Week Blues|author=John Consoli|periodical=Mediaweek|date=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Station standardization===
When the network launched, UPN began having most of its stations branded using a combination of "UPN" or "Paramount" (the latter having been used only by the network's Viacom-owned stations, some of whom adopted the "Paramount" branding prior to UPN's launch), and the affiliated station's channel number. By the late 1990s, affiliates were simply branded under the "UPN (channel number or city)" scheme (for example, Chicago affiliate WPWR-TV called itself "UPN Chicago" and New York City O&amp;O-turned-affiliate WWOR-TV was referred to as "UPN 9", until The CW's launch was announced in January 2006).

However, most of the UPN owned-and-operated stations under Viacom/CBS Corporation branded themselves by the network/city conventions (for example, [[KBCW (TV)|KBHK]]/[[San Francisco]] was branded as "UPN Bay Area," [[WKBD-TV|WKBD]]/[[Detroit]] was branded as "UPN Detroit" and [[WUPL]]/[[New Orleans]] was branded as "UPN New Orleans"). That type of branding did not always apply though, as for example, [[WSBK-TV]]/[[Boston]] was branded "UPN 38" and [[KMAX-TV]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] was branded "UPN 31". [[WPCW|WNPA]]/[[Pittsburgh]] originally branded itself as "UPN 19", but rebranded itself as "UPN Pittsburgh" soon after the network introduced its second and final logo in September 2002, making it one of the few that had carried both standardization styles. Many UPN-affiliated stations followed the same branding scheme (for example, [[KFVE]]/[[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] used the brand "UPN Hawaii").

This would be a continuation of the trend of networks using such naming schemes, which originated at Fox (and even earlier by [[CBC Television]] in Canada), and was also predominately used at CBS (which has most of its owned-and-operated stations, with a few exceptions, brand using a combination of the network's name and over-the-air channel number) and The WB (with the exception of its Tribune Broadcasting-owned affiliates in Los Angeles and Chicago, and certain other stations); NBC and ABC also use similar branding schemes, but not to the same universal level outside their O&amp;Os. While the "Big Three" networks do not require their affiliates to have such naming schemes (though some affiliates choose to adopt it anyway) and only on the network's O&amp;Os is the style required, UPN mandated it on all stations – though in one case, [[Milwaukee]] affiliate [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] branded as "Channel 24" from 1998 to 2001, excluding UPN imagery from its station branding (WCGV, which previously branded as "UPN 24", had disaffiliated from the network for eight months in 1998 due to a compensation dispute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinclair pulling more UPN affiliations|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20115938.html|author=Joe Schlosser|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 5, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151246/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20115938.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN, Sinclair make up|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50228020.html|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 3, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155249/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50228020.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''View of Toledo''''' (original title ''Vista de Toledo''), is one of the two surviving [[landscapes]] painted by [[El Greco]]. The other, ''[[View and Plan of Toledo]]'', is on display at the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo|Museo de El Greco]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

''View of Toledo'' is among the best known depictions of the sky in [[Western art]], along with [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[The Starry Night]]'' and the landscapes of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Claude Monet]], among others. Most notable is the distinct color contrast between the dark and somber skies above and the glowing green hills below. While influenced by the [[Mannerist]] style, El Greco's expressive handling of color and form is without parallel in the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, he takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo insofar as certain building locations are re-arranged. However, the location of the [[Castillo de San Servando|Castle of San Servando]], on the left, is accurately depicted. El Greco's signature appears in the lower-right corner.

==Style==
Landscape paintings were rare among Spanish paintings of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. The Council of Trent's ban against landscape painting lends credence to the idea that this work may stand as the first Spanish landscape painting of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/el-greco-view-of-toledo]&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this painting's enigmatic symbolism could be related to the mysticism that infused the city during the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1713.htm 'Vista de Toledo', ArteHistoria. Accedido el 8/11/2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918081854/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1713.htm |date=September 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English art historian David Davies asserts that the philosophies of [[Platonism]] and ancient [[Neo-Platonism]], the works of [[Plotinus]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.&lt;ref name="Davies20"&gt;D. Davies, "The Influence of Neo-Platonism on El Greco", 20 etc.&lt;br&gt;* D. Davies, ''the Byzantine Legacy in the Art of El Greco'', 425–445&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, concludes that the presence of "Byzantine memories" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.&lt;ref name="Lopera18-19"&gt;J.A. Lopera, ''El Greco: From Crete to Toledo'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{World Cinema}}

'''World cinema''' is not the sum-total of all films made around the world. Its use is analogous to the use of the term "world literature". Goethe used the concept of [[World literature|''Weltliteratur'']] (world literature) in several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe, including works of non-Western origin. An interest in "world cinema" suggests an awareness of high-quality films made outside the Hollywood studio system which dominates international viewership. However, some people use the term to refer to the [[film]] and [[film industry|film industries]] of non-English-speaking countries in English-speaking countries. Equating the dominant form of cinema with the dominant language (English) can be inherently problematic.There are many countries such as Canada, England, South Africa and even Asian countries like India, where films are made in English but they are part of "world cinema" due to their marginal status in terms of access or viewership. It can be argued that an understanding of "world cinema" centering around Hollywood cinema suggests an [[Eurocentric]] view. "World cinema" is often used interchangeably with the term '''foreign film'''. "Foreign" is also a relative term, suggesting a Western viewpoint. One person's national cinema can be another person's foreign film. In fact, American [[Independent film|independent cinema]] may be considered part of "world cinema" as it does not have adequate access. 

Technically, ''foreign film'' does not mean the same as ''foreign language film'', but the inference is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used.  As such, the use of the term ''foreign film'' for films produced in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada or other English-speaking countries would be uncommon within other English-speaking countries. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Types==
World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with "artistic value" as opposed to "Hollywood commercialism." Foreign language films are often grouped with "[[Art film|art house films]]" and other [[independent film]]s in DVD stores, cinema listings etc.
Unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English-speaking regions usually have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas. As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "World Cinema" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers. Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales.&lt;ref name="Curran 500"&gt;Curran, Daniel. ''Foreign Films: More than 500 films on video cassette,'' pages v-vi. Evanston, Illinois: CineBooks, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language films can be commercial, [[Low culture|low brow]] or [[B-movie]]s. Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings. Films of this type became more common in the early 2000s, as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[Amélie]]'',  ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'', ''[[Y Tu Mama Tambien]]'' and ''[[Talk to Her]]'' enjoyed great successes in United States cinemas and [[home video]] sales. The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American [[box office]] was ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Hero' Soars to Late August Record|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|work=boxofficemojo.com|author=Brandon Gray|date=August 29, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004023456/http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The rule for foreign-language films is that if you've done $5 million or better (in United States cinemas), you've had a very nice success; if you do $10 (million) or better (in United States cinemas), you're in blockbuster category," [[Warner Independent Pictures]] ex-president Mark Gill said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703133158/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000724461|title=Foreign affairs|date=3 July 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, English-dubbed foreign films rarely did well in United States box office (except [[Anime]] films).  The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson’s ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn’t Beautiful Anymore, it’s Dubbed|date=23 August 1999|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&amp;gwt=pay|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'', ''[[Godzilla 2000]]'', ''[[Anatomy (film)|Anatomy]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[High Tension]]'' flopped at United States box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180718041749/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|deadurl=yes|title=LITTLE INDIAN': BIG MISTAKE - The Washington Post|date=18 July 2018|archivedate=18 July 2018|website=Archive.today|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/082100.htm|title=Weekend Box Office|first=Gitesh|last=Pandya|website=Boxofficeguru.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-horn7|title='Pinocchio' will try again, in Italian|first=John|last=Horn|date=7 February 2003|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/|title=Girl with Dragon Tattoo Gets U.S. Release|first=Anne|last=Thompson|date=11 October 2009|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Miramax planned to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Gary G.|title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2007|page=44|isbn=0742554503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On DVD==
Foreign language films that are particularly successful in international markets may be taken on by the large [[film distributor|film distribution]] companies for [[DVD]] releases. At the other end of the scale, many foreign language films are never given a DVD release outside of their home markets. The majority of those DVDs that are given an international release, come out on specialist labels. These labels include:
* [[Arrow Films]] (UK) - Label specialising in foreign language and cult English language films
* [[Artificial Eye (distribution)|Artificial Eye]] (US and UK)
* Axiom Films (UK)
* [[British Film Institute]] (UK)
* Contender Entertainment Group - Label distributing East Asian films. They bought out ''Medusa Communications'' in 2005, and own the sub-labels [[Hong Kong Legends]] (specialising in films from [[Hong Kong]]) and ''Premier Asia'' (specialising in films from the rest of East Asia, particularly Japan, [[South Korea]] and [[Thailand]]). CEG bought out the label.
