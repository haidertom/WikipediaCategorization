      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''Adaptive sampling''' is a technique used in computational [[molecular biology]] to efficiently simulate [[protein folding]].

==Background==
Proteins spend a large portion – nearly 96% in some cases&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/&gt; – of their [[protein folding|folding]] time "waiting" in various [[thermodynamic free energy]] minima. Consequently, a straightforward simulation of this process would spend a great deal of computation to this state, with the transitions between the states – the aspects of protein folding of greater scientific interest – taking place only rarely.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; Adaptive sampling exploits this property to simulate the protein's [[phase space]] in between these states. Using adaptive sampling, molecular simulations that previously would have taken decades can be performed in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Theory==
If a protein folds through the [[metastable state]]s A -&gt; B -&gt; C, researchers can calculate the length of the transition time between A and C by simulating the A -&gt; B transition and the B -&gt; C transition. The protein may fold through alternative routes which may overlap in part with the A -&gt; B -&gt; C pathway. Decomposing the problem in this manner is efficient because each step can be simulated in parallel.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Applications==
Adaptive sampling is used by the [[Folding@home]] distributed computing project in combination with [[Hidden markov model|Markov state models]].&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
While adaptive sampling is useful for short simulations, longer trajectories may be more helpful for certain types of biochemical problems.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21799">'''Affiliative conflict theory''' ('''ACT''') is a social psychological approach that encompasses [[interpersonal communication]] and has a background in [[nonverbal communication]].  This [[theory]] postulates that "people have competing needs or desires for intimacy and autonomy" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;30). In any relationship, people will negotiate and try to balance out their own behavioral acts of (approach and avoidance) to maintain a comfortable level of [[intimacy]].&lt;ref name=Burgoon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.K.|title=Interpersonal Adaption: Dyadic Interaction Patterns.|journal=New York: Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Affiliative conflict theory (ACT), also referred to as equilibrium theory or model,&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; was first introduced in the 1960s by [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]]. His article "Eye Contact, Distance and Affiliation", co-authored with [[Janet Dean Fodor|Janet Dean]] was published in ''Sociometry'' in 1965, and has been used greatly as the base line for ACT. Michael Argyle had a long distinguished career in which he advanced the field of [[social psychology]]. His work on [[nonverbal communication]] greatly developed this [[theory]] and his book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Behavior'' became an international bestseller in 1967. Argyle's curiosity regarding if [[social skills]] were learned in the same way as manual skills led him to research interpersonal behavior.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Throughout his life's work he had various associates (Argyle &amp; Dean, 1965; Argyle &amp; Lalljee &amp; Cook, 1968, Argyle &amp; Ingham, 1972; Argyle &amp; Ingham, Alkema &amp; McCallin, 1972); all of which worked to validate the [[theory]] through their focus on the relationship between visual behavior (nonverbal behavior) and interpersonal distance (Coutts, pg. 3). Visual behavior research studies deal with influence, and with attributions made by observers. This reflects psychological [[research]] on nonverbal cues.&lt;ref name=Coutts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: Exploration of the Notions of Intimacy Equilibrium and Behavioral Compensation|journal=Windsor: University of Windsor.|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept of nonverbal behavior==

There are numerous behaviors that fall under nonverbal involvement.  The nonverbal includes [[distance]], [[gaze]], [[touch]], body orientation, body lean, facial expressiveness, talking duration, interruptions, postural openness, relational gestures, head nods, and paralinguistic cues such as [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], which are at least as important as the words spoken in communicating to others.&lt;ref name=Meh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehrabian|first=A.|title=Orientation behaviors and nonverbal attitude communication.|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1967|pages=324–332|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1967.tb01190.x|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the basic study of nonverbal communications that was tested is the study of temporal patterning which is defined  as relation to events in the vocal-verbal channel, when the receiver looks for cues, responds to them, and interprets them, and other times when the same movement or configuration will be unnoticed or disregarded.&lt;ref name=Mortensen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortensen|first=D.|title=Communication Theory|journal=New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also beliefs that some nonverbal involvement cues have been found to increase personal performance on tasks such as test, verbal encoding, and relationship building.

Along with nonverbal behavior, another basic concept to understand is immediacy. [[Immediacy (philosophy)|Immediacy]] is generally defined as the degree of directness and intensity of interaction between two entities, such as two people.&lt;ref name=Remland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remland|first=M.|author2=Jones, T.|title=The effects of nonverbal involvement and communication apprehension on state anxiety, interpersonal attraction, and speech duration.|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=1989|volume=37|issue=3|pages=170–183|doi=10.1080/01463378909385538}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Immediacy of body orientation is defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's median plane" (i.e., the plane perpendicular to the communicator's chest) passes through the addressee's position.&lt;ref name=Remland /&gt; When discussing immediacy, you tend to look at the head orientation of a communicator towards his addressee or it may be defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's head is directed towards the addressee's position. Duration of interaction between two individuals is defined as the length of time during which the two individuals are in each other's presence.

==Argyle and Cook's modifications==

In 1976, Argyle and Cook modified and extended their original theory after concluding only partial support for compensation.

:o In their first modification they added:

::-  Form of address – emotional expression
::- Absence of physical barriers
::- Openness of posture
::- Friendliness&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The second modification addressed:

::- Effects of social norms (environment) on how people interact or obtain equilibrium levels.
::-  For example, "a couple may have a mutually strong approach need, but may "constrain" their intimacy behaviors to a socially acceptable lever if they are in public."&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The third modification addressed:

::- Acknowledges that reciprocity may occur in response to intimacy changes. (burgoon 32)

==Empirical support==

Many academic scholars have researched ACT. Joseph Cappella, Ira Firestone, and John Aiello are just a few scholars whose conclusions of ACT differed. The first scholar, Joseph Cappella, did thirty-six studies in his review that concluded that "increased proximity leads to compensatory responses on distancing, gaze, posture, body orientation, bodily activity, verbal output, and the like" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). His results also theorize that physical closeness create a discomfort in partners that then respond by "increasing physical distance or psychological distance" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33) The second scholar, Ira Firestone is known for his research on Reconciling verbal and nonverbal models of dyadic communications.&lt;ref name=Firestone&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Firestone|first=I.|journal=Reconciling Verbal and Nonverbal Models of Dyadic Commission|year=1977|volume=2|issue=1|pages=30–44|doi=10.1007/bf01127016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone's conclusion was opposite to Cappella's. He concluded in one of his reviews that responses to spatial adjustments had various results. "Spatial distance, posture, and visual behavior features of dyadic interaction appear to show complex interdependencies. Both facilitative and inhibitory relationships abound. Clearly, the conclusion that non-verbal approach by one party induces withdrawal by the other is unwanted" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The third scholar, John Aiello came to a more tempered conclusion. His studies reflected that compensation is more common in stable relationships rather than developing ones. He also stated that "comfort-oriented models do not predict observable compensation as long as variations immediacy behaviors fall with in optimal distance range" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The different conclusions between these three scholars can only give a partial and inconsistent support of ACT, with proximity being the most consistent elicitor of compensation.

==Recent modifications==
Further research has added the concepts of [[cognition]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s however its "reliance on the basic assumptions and elements of Act affirms its influential impact and some of the "truths" it has uncovered" (Burgoon, pg. 38). According to Judy Burgoon the, "most significant contributions have been the introduction of arousal or discomfort as a primary indicator of behavioral changes, and attention to compensation as one major interaction pattern in [[interpersonal communication]]" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

The concept of compensation was first introduced and added to the theory by Larry Coutts and Frank Schneider in 1976 in their ACT article that investigated the intimacy equilibrium and compensation hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Coutts2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|author2=Schneider|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: An Investigation of the Intimacy Equilibrium and Compensation Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1976|pages=1135–1142|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.6.1135|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent modifications of ACT, as seen in John Aiello and Donna Thompson's comfort model which came about in 1979,&lt;ref name=Ailloe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ailloe|first=J.|author2=Thompson, D.|title=Interpersonal Distance Preferences|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|year=1979|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–118|doi=10.1007/bf01006355}}&lt;/ref&gt; was at odds with ACT's basic premise; due to the conclusion that discomfort is not the trigger for compensation. Because "discomfort is only activated when interaction behaviors become extreme" (Burgoon, pg. 36). Another modification was done by Knowles (1980, 1989) whom introduced the rubric of field theory. One important contribution is that "behavior is goal oriented and purposeful, not necessarily mindful (Burgoon, pg. 36) The environments impact on human behavior also added another addition to ACT, known as field theory. Field Theory shows, that approach and avoidance gradients draw people together and apart. Approach is the need and desires whereas avoidance comes from enduring features like the fear of rejection. In 1989, Knowles "reconceptualization of ACT is that people feel discomfort when their internal approach and avoidance gradients are not equal" (Burgoon, pg. 36). "Knowles also allows for constant redefinition of gradieSnts and thus a fluctuating equilibrium level" (Burgoon, pg. 37). The problems it creates for ACT is such that, if gradients fluctuate "from moment to moment" then accurate predictions appears limited" (Burgoon, pg. 37). An interesting notion to take from these modifications is that "even when we want to be intimate with another, the fear of being too intimate or being rejected (avoidance gradient) may lurk in the background as an influential factor determining behavior" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

==Equilibrium==
The affiliative conflict theory becomes complex when one considers that approach and avoidance preferences are not the same, for example; when two people have "differing preferred levels of intimacy" (Burgoon, pg. 31). When two interactants have differing preferred levels of intimacy, they must (consciously or unconsciously) negotiate their differences to arrive at an equilibrium or [[homeostasis]] level that is mutually acceptable. This level of [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] is known as the intimacy equilibrium point. Equilibrium is reached when individuals or dyads can maintain sufficient [[distance]] and immediacy, such that they are close enough to meet affiliative needs, while allowing each other [[privacy]] and [[autonomy]]. ACT modification to discuss the process of compensation, is utilized to restore equilibrium. [[Anxiety]] is an example of an intimate behavior that can come from a disturbed or unbalanced equilibrium level.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; Thus, equilibrium can only be established when the two people/dyads are able to negotiate and maintain a comfortable level of intimacy through their nonverbal interactions.

"Because the intimacy equilibrium is said to be a product of several interrelated behaviors, it is not clear as to the influence of such variables on the overall equilibrium level. That is, while a particular factor may affect interpersonal immediacy along one behavioral dimension (e.g., eye contact) this effect may be offset by a compensatory shift in immediacy along some other (unmeasured) behavioral dimension (e.g. body orientation or interpersonal distance). As a consequence, a change may occur in one behavioral dimension, although there would be little relative change in the equilibrium as a whole" (Coutts, pg. 5.)&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

Affiliative Conflict Theory thus proposes that there are two separate, but related; propositions that involve maintaining the balance of the intimacy equilibrium point. The first is the "establishment of an equilibrium or balance of approach and avoidance forces reflected in the intensity of immediacy behaviors emitted by the interactants" (Coutts, pg. 3). The second deals with "compensatory changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium" (Coutts, pg. 3). These propositions can also be explained as balanced and unbalanced.&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

===Balanced===
A balanced equilibrium is created when there is an increase in affiliative behavior, notably a decrease in avoidance. All nonverbal behaviors contribute to maintaining balance but researchers focus mostly on three nonverbal behaviors of intimacy and their relationship, which include eye contact, physical proximity and need for affiliation.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

[[File:The Gaze.jpg|thumbnail|right|Increased eye contact and physical proximity during social interaction warrants an increase in intimacy.]]

::• '''''[[Eye-contact]]''''': Eye-contact can have a variety of subjective meanings such as friendship, sexual attraction, hate and struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=Argle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arygle|first=M.|author2=Dean, J.|title=Eye-Contact, Distance and Affiliation|journal=Sociometry|year=1965|volume=28|issue=3|pages=289–304|doi=10.2307/2786027}}&lt;/ref&gt; During social interaction, people look each other in the eye, repeatedly but short periods. If we may anticipate, people look most while they are listening, and use glances of about 3-10 seconds in length. When applied to the affiliative conflict theory, the approach forces include the need for feedback and affiliative needs. Argyle suggests that increased eye contact during interaction warrants an increase in intimacy. Eye contact is a reinforcer in the operative conditioning of verbal behavior such as looking your partner in the eye when you say I love you or during wedding vows.&lt;ref name=Argle /&gt;

::• '''''Physical Proximity''''' – The interpersonal distance between individuals can also affect the intimacy equilibrium level. During social interaction, one's intimacy should increase when individuals are close in space.&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russo|first=N.|title=Eye Contact, Interpersonal Distance, and the Equilibrium Theory.|journal=American Psychological Association|year=1975|volume=31|issue=3|pages=497–502|doi=10.1037/h0076476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hug or kiss are good examples of nonverbal behaviors that increase intimacy between two interactants. It's important to note that in order to maintain a certain level of intimacy a change in one's behavior, such as interpersonal distance, must be compensated for by a change in another, such as eye contact.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=B.|author2=Goldberg, G.|author3= Keisler, C.|title=) Visual behavior and face-to-face distance during interaction|journal=Sociometry|year=1969|volume=32|issue=1|pages=43–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
::• '''''[[Need for affiliation]]''''' – The need for affiliation in a balanced equilibrium concerns the desire to be associated with specific people and groups, to have a greater sense of belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = S. | last2 = Rosenblood | first2 = L. | year = 1996 | title = Affiliation motivation in everyday experience: A theoretical comparison | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 513–522 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in human interactions and the formation of bonds and relationships. As a principle of this theory, the need for affiliation is determines the motivation for both verbal and nonverbal behaviors between two individuals. A person with a moderate need of affiliation towards another person tends to want to be intimate with that individual. One of the best examples is a wedding proposal. A man's desire to have a more intimate relationship with a woman is put on display and warrants a verbal response which also validates the woman's need for affiliation if she accepts his proposal.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt; 
 
It is supposed that similar considerations apply to other types of behavior, which are linked with affiliative motivation. Thus, there have been many studies surrounding the equilibrium point of intimacy of conversation and of amount of smiling. The more these behaviors occur, the more affiliative motivation is satisfied, but if they go too far or are decreased, anxiety is created and an avoidance behavior is shown.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

===Unbalanced===

An unbalance is created when there is a decrease in affiliative behavior, notably increased avoidance, changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium.  If equilibrium for intimacy is disturbed along one of its dimensions, attempts will first be made to restore it by adjusting the others. If this is not possible because all are held constant, or because the deviation is too extreme, the subject will feel uncomfortable.  If the disturbance is in the direction of less intimacy, he/she will simply feel deprived of affiliative satisfactions. Another source of unbalance is [[communication apprehension]] (CA).&lt;ref name=Meh /&gt; CA constitute a mediating variable and is characterizes as apprehension as an internal feeling of considerable discomfort which leads to communication avoidance. Thus, persons who report high levels of CA experience more anxiety during an interaction than persons who report low levels of CA. Examples of a typical unbalance in response to the close approach of another is to compensate with gaze aversion, indirect body orientation, backing away from a touch, and increased distance.  A person can use avoidance behavior that express a desire to resist what is considered an inappropriate increase in the level of intimacy for that particular interaction.

==Gender roles==

Research shows that gender plays an important role in ACT. As Argyle (1967) points out, females are socialized to have a higher [[affiliative]] orientation, which they may express through using more eye contact.  However, other explanations can account for the higher use of mutual gaze by females.&lt;ref name=Argyle3&gt;{{cite book|last=Argyle|first=M.|title=The psychology of interpersonal behavior,|year=1967|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher affiliative orientation may increase the female's sensitivity and/or responsivity to social cues. Since the eyes are the prime source of information about another's attention, females that socializes in our culture would be expected to look more at the other person's eyes for this social information, thus increasing the amount of time a female dyad engages in eye contact, and perhaps (but not necessarily) increasing the mean length of mutual gaze for the dyad. The data show that the looking time in general shows an increase in the significance of the sex effect with age. Females may rely more on external cues in general, and insofar as the eyes of another are salient cues, the percentage of time in monitoring them should increase.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;  
  
Interpersonal distance was examined after a study about eye contact and mean length of mutual glance by Argyle and Ingham (1972) showed conflicting and reversal effects between males and females.&lt;ref name=Argyle4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argyle|first=M.|author2=Ingham, R.|title=Gaze, mutual gaze, and proximity|journal=Semiotica|pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Russo conducted a study that focused on the eye-contact and distance relationship. In this study, 24 males and 24 females were drawn in same-sex pairs from kindergarten, third, and sixth grades and asked to "try out some distances and tell (the researcher) how they like them" (p.&amp;nbsp;499). Each participant sat and conversed for 2 minutes at each of the three distances. At each 2 minute interval the researcher asked the subjects how they liked talking at that particular distance. Russo found that the percentage of time engaged in contact (a) increased with distance, (b) was higher for females than males; and (c) did not significantly differ with friendship. In terms of the mean length of eye contact it: (a) did not significantly increase with interpersonal distance; (b) was higher for females than for males; and (c) was significantly greater for friends than nonfriends. Thus, the mean length of eye-contact appears to index affiliative tendencies, while the total amount of eye-contact does not.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;

'''Aquatic biomonitoring''' is the [[science]] of inferring the [[ecological]] condition of [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s by examining the [[organism]]s that live there. While aquatic biomonitoring is the most common form of such biomonitoring, any [[ecosystem]] can be studied in this manner.

Biomonitoring typically takes different approaches:

* ''[[Bioassay]]s'', where test organisms are exposed to an environment to see if [[mutation]]s or deaths occur. Typical organisms used in bioassays are [[fish]], water fleas ([[Daphnia]]), and [[frog]]s.
* ''Community assessments'', also called ''[[biosurvey]]s,'' where an entire [[Community (ecology)|community]] of organisms is sampled, to see what types of [[taxa]] remain. In [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, these assessments often focus on [[invertebrate]]s, [[algae]], [[macrophyte]]s (aquatic plants), fish, or [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= 6|pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, other large vertebrates ([[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s) are considered as well.
* ''Online biomonitoring devices'', using the ability of animals to permanently taste their environment. Different types of animals are used for that purpose either under lab or field conditions. The use of valve opening/closing activity of [[clams]] is one of the possible ways to monitor ''in-situ'' the quality of freshwater and coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;

Aquatic invertebrates have the longest history of use in biomonitoring programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Barbour |first1=M.T. |last2=Gerritsen |first2=J. |last3=Snyder |first3=B.D. |last4=Stribling |first4=J.B. |date=1999 |title=Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish |edition=2nd |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20004OQK.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Office of Water |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 841-B-99-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical unpolluted temperate streams of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], certain insect taxa predominate. Mayflies ([[Ephemeroptera]]), caddisflies ([[Trichoptera]]), and stoneflies ([[Plecoptera]]) are the most common insects in these undisturbed streams. In rivers disturbed by [[urbanization]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and other perturbations, flies ([[Diptera]]), and especially midges (family [[Chironomidae]]) predominate.  Aquatic invertebrates are responsive to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.E., K.B. Lunde, R.D. Mazor, L.A. Bêche, E.P. McElravy, and V.H. Resh. 2010.

== Importance==
Aquatic Biomonitoring is important in monitoring marine life and their ecosystems. Monitoring aquatic life can also be beneficial in understanding land ecosystems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/dep/water/monitoring/biomonitoring/why.htm|title=Why Biological Monitoring? -- Monitoring and Assessment, Bureau of Land and Water Quality, Maine Department of Environmental Protection|website=www.maine.gov|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before there were tetrapods, there were fish. These fish then evolved into tetrapods that we see today. Because of this, aquatic life still has a major impact on life on land. Aquatic biomonitoring can represent the overall health and status of the environment, detect different environmental trends and how different stressors will affect those trends, and interpret the affect of different environmental activity will have on the overall health of the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straightupenvironmental.com/biomonitoring/|title=biomonitoring – StraightUp Environmental|website=www.straightupenvironmental.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution and general stresses to aquatic life can have a huge impact on the environment in general. The main sources of pollution to oceans, rivers, and lakes are [[sewage]], [[oil spill]]s, [[land runoff]], [[litter]]ing, [[ocean mining]], and [[nuclear waste]]. These types of pollution cause a huge upset to marine life and can endanger any species in the water or that live close to the water. When aquatic species are affected, it causes a ripple effect. Many aquatic animals are a main food source for many land animals. For example: if a specific species of fish ingest toxins and become sick, the birds that ingest that species of fish will also become sick. Then the animal that ingest that bird will also become sick. This is a problem that can be avoided by monitoring all life and conditions in different bodies of water, including fresh and salt water.

The main draw back on aquatic biomonitoring is simplifying data and making data easier for all to understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking data from monitoring sites and making it available for people to use in the health fields and other environmental fields can be a challenge.

== Practice ==
Mechanisms that are used for Aquatic Biomonitoring are monitoring and assessing aquatic species and ecosystems, monitoring the behavior of certain aquatic species and assessing any changes in species behavior, and looking at contaminants in the water and their effect on marine life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartram|first=Jamie|date=1996-01-01|title=Water quality monitoring: a practical guide to the design and implementation of freshwater quality studies and monitoring programmes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253953121|journal=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is graded on several scales. One is the water’s appearance. Is the water clear, cloudy, full of algae. Next, water is graded on its chemistry levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/23847.html|title=Biomonitoring - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; How much of each enzyme or mineral located in the water is extremely important. Any changes in any of these factors can change the water’s environment overall and therefore change how life in the water is. These changes can severely impact aquatic life. Certain contaminants, such as metal and certain organic waste, can cause death of some individuals and which could ultimately cause extinction to certain species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This would be detrimental to not only aquatic ecosystems, but also to some ecosystems on land as well. Extinction of any species can have a ripple effect and can cause disruption in other biomes and ecosystems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2555">The '''Associated Colleges of the South''' ('''ACS''') is a consortium of 16 [[liberal arts college]]s in the [[southern United States]]. It was formed in 1991. Its mission is to champion and enhance residential liberal arts education through collaborative projects among its member institutions.

==Activities==
The Associated Colleges of the South seeks to enhance member excellence and reduce costs through collaboration.  The consortium has primarily undertaken projects for the professional development of faculty. Collaborative efforts include: sharing of best practices; professional networking for faculty, staff and administrators through online communities and regular, in-person meetings; and joint-service activities such as shared legal counsel. ACS has been awarded several millions of dollars in private grants from various philanthropic foundations to be redistributed amongst member institutions on a competitive basis to support projects that require collaboration between and among members. A special focus has been collaborations that advance diversity and inclusion on member campuses, or that help faculty develop new skills and new pedagogical approaches, especially those that use the internet and computing.  ACS also manages a tuition exchange program that allows the children of the faculty and staff at member institutions to attend other institutions within the consortium.

'''Bionics''' or '''biologically inspired engineering''' is the application of biological methods and systems found in [[nature]] to the study and design of [[engineering]] systems and modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6DFBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA644&amp;ots=u_Vt-ceEvU&amp;dq=%22bionical%20creativity%20engineering%22&amp;pg=PA644#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bionical%20creativity%20engineering%22&amp;f=false Twenty-First Century's Fuel Sufficiency Roadmap] By Dr. Steve Esomba, Published 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bionic'' was coined by [[Jack E. Steele]] in 1958, possibly originating from the [[International scientific vocabulary|technical term]] ''bion'' (pronounced ''BEE-on''; from {{lang-grc|βίος}} ''bíos''), meaning 'unit of [[life]]' and the suffix ''-ic'', meaning 'like' or 'in the manner of', hence 'like life'. Some dictionaries, however, explain the word as being formed as a [[portmanteau]] from '''''bio'''logy'' and ''electro'''nics'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bionics "bionics"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by the 1970s U.S. television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', both based upon the novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' by [[Martin Caidin]], which was itself influenced by Steele's work. All feature humans given superhuman powers by [[electromechanical]] implants.

The [[technology transfer|transfer of technology]] between lifeforms and manufactured objects is, according to proponents of bionic technology, desirable because evolutionary pressure typically forces living organisms, including fauna and flora, to become highly optimized and efficient. A classical example is the development of dirt- and water-repellent paint (coating) from the observation that practically nothing sticks to the surface of the [[Nelumbo|lotus flower]] plant (the [[lotus effect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

The term "biomimetic" is preferred when reference is made to chemical reactions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  In that domain, biomimetic chemistry refers to reactions that, in nature, involve biological [[macromolecules]] (e.g. enzymes or nucleic acids) whose chemistry can be replicated ''in vitro'' using much smaller molecules.

Examples of bionics in engineering include the hulls of boats imitating the thick skin of dolphins; [[sonar]], [[radar]], and medical [[ultrasound]] imaging imitating [[animal echolocation]].

In the field of [[computer science]], the study of bionics has produced [[artificial neurons]], [[neural network|artificial neural networks]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in Research Interests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000000/http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in |date=14 November 2012 }}. Duke.edu. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[swarm intelligence]]. [[Evolutionary computation]] was also motivated by bionics ideas but it took the idea further by simulating evolution [[in silico]] and producing well-optimized solutions that had never appeared in nature.

It is estimated by [[Julian Vincent]], professor of [[biomimetics]] at the [[University of Bath]]'s Department of Mechanical Engineering, that "at present there is only a 12% overlap between [[biology]] and technology in terms of the mechanisms used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vincent, J. F. V.|author2=Bogatyreva, O. A.|author3=Bogatyrev, N. R.|author4=Bowyer, A.|author5=Pahl, A.-K.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2006|title= Biomimetics—its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume= 3|pages=471–482|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|issue=9|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name biomimetics was coined by [[Otto Schmitt]] in the 1950s. The term bionics was coined by [[Jack E. Steele]] in 1958 while working at the ''Aeronautics Division House'' at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. However, terms like biomimicry or biomimetics are more preferred in the technology world in efforts to avoid confusion between the medical term bionics. Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', which inspired the series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.

== Methods ==
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Velcro]] was inspired by the tiny hooks found on the surface of [[bur]]s.]]
The study of bionics often emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, [[cybernetics]] tries to model the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while [[artificial intelligence]] tries to model the intelligent function regardless of the particular way it can be achieved.

The conscious copying of examples and mechanisms from natural organisms and ecologies is a form of applied [[case-based reasoning]], treating nature itself as a database of solutions that already work. Proponents argue that the [[selective pressure]] placed on all [[life|natural life forms]] minimizes and removes failures.

Although almost all [[engineering]] could be said to be a form of [[biomimicry]], the modern origins of this field are usually attributed to [[Buckminster Fuller]] and its later codification as a house or field of study to [[Janine Benyus]].

There are generally three biological levels in the fauna or flora, after which technology can be modeled:
*Mimicking natural '''methods of manufacture'''
*Imitating '''mechanisms''' found in nature ([[velcro]])
*Studying '''organizational principles from the [[Collective animal behavior|social behaviour of organisms]]''', such as the [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking behaviour]] of birds, optimization of [[Ant colony optimization|ant foraging]] and [[Bee colony optimization|bee foraging]], and the swarm intelligence (SI)-based behaviour of a [[Shoaling and schooling|school of fish]].

== Examples ==
* In [[robotics]], bionics and biomimetics are used to apply the way animals move to the design of robots.  [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the movements and physiology of kangaroos.
*[[Velcro]] is the most famous example of biomimetics.  In 1948, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Georges de Mestral|George de Mestral]] was cleaning his dog of burrs picked up on a walk when he realized how the hooks of the [[Burr (fruit)|burr]]s clung to the fur.
*The horn-shaped, saw-tooth design for [[lumberjack]] blades used at the turn of the 19th century to cut down trees when it was still done by hand was modeled after observations of a wood-burrowing [[beetle]]. It revolutionized the industry because the blades worked so much faster at felling trees.
*[[Cat's eye (road)|Cat's eye reflectors]] were invented by [[Percy Shaw]] in 1935 after studying the mechanism of cat eyes. He had found that cats had a system of reflecting cells, known as [[tapetum lucidum]], which was capable of reflecting the tiniest bit of light.
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s flying machines and ships are early examples of drawing from nature in engineering.
*[[Resilin]] is a replacement for rubber that has been created by studying the material also found in arthropods.
*Julian Vincent drew from the study of [[Conifer cone|pinecones]] when he developed in 2004 "smart" clothing that adapts to changing temperatures.  "I wanted a nonliving [[system]] which would respond to changes in moisture by changing shape", he said. "There are several such systems in plants, but most are very small — the pinecone is the largest and therefore the easiest to work on".  Pinecones respond to higher humidity by opening their scales (to disperse their seeds). The "smart" fabric does the same thing, opening up when the wearer is warm and sweating, and shutting tight when cold.
*"Morphing aircraft wings" that change shape according to the speed and duration of flight were designed in 2004 by biomimetic scientists from [[Penn State University]]. The morphing wings were inspired by different bird species that have differently shaped wings according to the speed at which they fly.  In order to change the shape and underlying structure of the aircraft wings, the researchers needed to make the overlying skin also be able to change, which their design does by covering the wings with fish-inspired scales that could slide over each other. In some respects this is a refinement of the [[swing-wing]] design.

[[Image:Lotus3.jpg|thumb|Lotus leaf surface, [[3D computer graphics|rendered]]: microscopic view]]
*Some paints and roof tiles have been engineered to be self-cleaning by copying the mechanism from the [[Nelumbo|Nelumbo lotus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/09/sto_lotusan_bio.php Sto Lotusan — Biomimicry Paint]. TreeHugger. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cholesteric liquid crystal]]s (CLCs) are the thin-film material often used to fabricate fish tank thermometers or [[mood ring]]s, that change color with temperature changes. They change color because their molecules are arranged in a [[helix|helical]] or [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different [[wavelength]]s of light.  [[Chiral Photonics, Inc.]] has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted [[optical fiber|glass fiber]].
*[[Nanostructures]] and physical mechanisms that produce the shining color of [[butterfly]] wings were reproduced [[in silico]] by [[Greg Parker (physicist)|Greg Parker]], professor of Electronics and Computer Science at the [[University of Southampton]] and research student [[Luca Plattner]] in the field of [[photonics]], which is [[electronics]] using [[photons]] as the information carrier instead of [[electrons]].
* The wing structure of the blue [[morpho butterfly]] was studied and the way it reflects light was mimicked to create an [[RFID]] tag that can be read through water and on metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfidradio.com/?p=26 RFID Through Water and on Metal with 99.9% Reliability (Episode 015)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, RFID Radio&lt;/ref&gt;
* The wing structure of butterflies has also inspired the creation of new nanosensors to detect explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors Nanosensors inspired by butterfly wings (Wired UK)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017124358/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors |date=17 October 2010 }}.

=== In medicine ===
'''Bionics''' refers to the flow of concepts from [[biology]] to [[engineering]] and vice versa. Hence, there are two slightly different points of view regarding the meaning of the word.

In medicine, '''bionics''' means the replacement or enhancement of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] or other body parts by mechanical versions. Bionic implants differ from mere [[prosthesis|prostheses]] by mimicking the original function very closely, or even surpassing it.

Bionics' German equivalent, ''Bionik'', always adheres to the broader meaning, in that it tries to develop engineering solutions from biological models. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological solutions will usually be optimized by [[evolutionary]] forces.

While the technologies that make bionic implants possible are developing gradually, a few successful bionic devices exist, a well known one being the Australian-invented multi-channel [[cochlear implant]] (bionic ear), a device for [[deaf]] people. Since the bionic ear, many bionic devices have emerged and work is progressing on bionics solutions for other sensory disorders (e.g. vision and balance).   Bionic research has recently provided treatments for medical problems such as neurological and psychiatric conditions, for example Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicsqueensland.com.au/bionics-in-our-world/|title=Bionic devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Bionics Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004 fully functional [[artificial heart]]s were developed. Significant progress is expected with the advent of [[nanotechnology]]. A well-known example of a proposed nanodevice is a [[respirocyte]], an artificial red cell, designed (though not built yet) by [[Robert Freitas]]. 

Kwabena Boahen from [[Ghana]] was a professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the '''University of Pennsylvania'''. During his eight years at Penn, he developed a [[silicon]] [[retina]] that was able to process images in the same manner as a living retina. He confirmed the results by comparing the electrical signals from his silicon retina to the electrical signals produced by a [[salamander]] eye while the two retinas were looking at the same image.

In 2007 the Scottish company [[Touch Bionics]] launched the first commercially available bionic hand, named "i-Limb Hand". According to the firm, by May 2010 it has been fitted to more than 1,200 patients worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1273258/i-Limb-Pulse-Bionic-hand-uses-wireless-technology-unveiled.html Bionic hand that uses wireless technology unveiled], Mail Online, 6 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nichi-In group is working on biomimicking scaffolds in tissue engineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine have given a detailed classification on biomimetics in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrm.org/biomimetics.htm Biomimetics and NCRM, Nichi-In classification of Biomimetics Biomimicry tissue engineering, stem cells, cell therapy].

On 21 July 2015, the [[BBC]]’s medical correspondent [[Fergus Walsh]] reported, "Surgeons in Manchester have performed the first bionic eye implant in a patient with the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. Ray Flynn, 80, has dry age-related macular degeneration which has led to the total loss of his central vision. He is using a retinal implant which converts video images from a miniature video camera worn on his glasses. He can now make out the direction of white lines on a computer screen using the retinal implant." The implant, known as the [[Argus retinal prosthesis#History|Argus II]] and manufactured in the US by the company [[Second Sight Medical Products]], had been used previously in patients who were blind as the result of the rare inherited degenerative eye disease [[retinitis pigmentosa]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 21 July 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Bionic eye implant world first|url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33571412| last= Walsh| first= Fergus|date= 22 July 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
A political form of biomimicry is [[bioregional democracy]], wherein political borders conform to natural [[ecoregions]] rather than human cultures or the outcomes of prior conflicts.

Critics of these approaches often argue that [[ecological selection]] itself is a poor model of minimizing [[manufacturing complexity]] or conflict, and that the [[free market]] relies on conscious cooperation, agreement, and standards as much as on efficiency – more analogous to [[sexual selection]]. [[Charles Darwin]] himself contended that both were balanced in [[natural selection]] – although his contemporaries often avoided frank talk about sex, or any suggestion that free market success was based on persuasion, not value.

Advocates, especially in the [[anti-globalization movement]], argue that the mating-like processes of standardization, financing and marketing, are already examples of [[runaway evolution]] – rendering a system that appeals to the consumer but which is inefficient at use of energy and raw materials.  Biomimicry, they argue, is an effective strategy to restore basic efficiency.

Biomimicry is also the second principle of [[Natural Capitalism]].

=== Other uses ===

[[Business biomimetics]] is the latest development in the application of biomimetics. Specifically it applies principles and practice from biological systems to business strategy, process, organisation design and strategic thinking. It has been successfully used by a range of industries in FMCG, defence, central government, packaging and business services. Based on the work by Phil Richardson at the [[University of Bath]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817164045/http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ |date=17 August 2009 }}. Bath.ac.uk (21 February 2009). Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; the approach was launched at the House of Lords in May 2009.

In a more specific meaning, it is a [[creativity techniques|creativity technique]] that tries to use [[nature|biological]] prototypes to get ideas for engineering solutions. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological organisms and their organs have been well optimized by [[evolution]]. In chemistry, a [[biomimetic synthesis]] is a [[chemical synthesis]] inspired by [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes.

Another, more recent meaning of the term bionics refers to merging organism and machine. This approach results in a hybrid system combining biological and engineering parts, which can also be referred as a cybernetic organism ([[cyborg]]). Practical realization of this was demonstrated in [[Kevin Warwick]]'s implant experiments bringing about [[ultrasound]] input via his own nervous system.

'''''Bowers v. Hardwick''''', 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[sodomy law]] criminalizing [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual sodomy and heterosexual sodomy.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{ussc|name=Bowers v. Hardwick|478|186|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This case was overturned in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

The majority opinion, by Justice [[Byron White]], reasoned that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not confer “a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy”.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt; A concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] cited the “ancient roots” of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting [[William Blackstone]]’s description of homosexual sex as an “infamous crime against nature”, worse than rape, and “a crime not fit to be named”. Burger concluded: “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”&lt;ref name="concurrence"/&gt; Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]] later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.

The senior dissent, by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an “almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity" and an “overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases”. In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: “That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.”&lt;ref name="blackmun-dissent"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 211 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen years after ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{ussc|name=Lawrence v. Texas|volume=539|page=558|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.

==Background==
In early July 1982, [[Atlanta Police Department (Georgia)|Atlanta police]] officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a citation for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle into a trash can outside the gay bar where he worked, allegedly observing him violating the city's ordinance that prohibits drinking in public.&lt;ref name=nussbaum&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195305319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a clerical error on the citation issued by Torick, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying a $50 fine at a court office, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's house three weeks later, on August 3, to serve the now-invalid warrant.&lt;ref name=eskridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eskridge|first1=William N.|title=Sodomy Laws in America, 1861-2003|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|pages=232–234|isbn=9780670018628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Price"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians V. The Supreme Court|date=2002|publisher=Basic Books|pages=277–280|isbn=9780465015146}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, an unrelated guest of Hardwick was sleeping on the couch in Hardwick's living room; at around 8:30 am, Officer Torick entered the house (the front door may have been ajar) and awoke the guest, then proceeded down a hallway towards Hardwick's bedroom.&lt;ref name="nussbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; The officer opened the bedroom door, and Torick observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=278}}

Hardwick was angry at the intrusion and threatened to have Torick fired for entering his home. Torick later stated that he "would never have made the case if [Hardwick] hadn't had an attitude problem."&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; Torick then arrested both men for [[sodomy]], a felony under Georgia law that carried a sentence of one to twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Code Ann. § 16-6-2 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; District Attorney Lewis Slaton chose not to prosecute the sodomy charge, considering that the warrant had expired, and his own belief that the sodomy law should not be used to prosecute consensual sexual activity.&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt;

Hardwick then sued [[Mike Bowers|Michael Bowers]], the [[attorney general]] of Georgia, in federal court for a [[declaratory judgment]] that the state's sodomy law was invalid. He charged that as a non-celibate gay man, he was liable to eventually be prosecuted for his activities. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had been searching for a “perfect test case” to challenge anti-sodomy laws, and Hardwick's cause presented the one they were looking for.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=279}} They approached Hardwick, who agreed to be represented by ACLU attorneys.

In the lower federal courts, Hardwick was represented by attorney Kathleen Wilde. The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]], where it was dismissed, with the Court ruling in favor of Bowers. Hardwick appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was indeed an infringement upon Hardwick's Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hardwick v. Bowers |vol=760 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1202 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/760/1202/75648/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Georgia then appealed, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted [[certiorari]] on November&amp;nbsp;4, 1985, to review the case.

Hardwick was represented before the Supreme Court by [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Laurence Tribe]]. Michael Hobbs, assistant attorney general, argued the case for the State. The legality of the officer's entry into Hardwick's home was not contested; only the constitutionality of the sodomy statute was challenged.

A heterosexual married couple was initially named in the suit as plaintiffs [[John Doe|John and Mary Doe]], alleging that they wished to engage in sodomy but were prevented from doing so by the Georgia anti-sodomy law.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt; But they failed to obtain [[Standing (law)|standing]] and were dropped from the suit.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court issued a 5-4 ruling upholding the sodomy laws. Justice [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Warren E. Burger]], and [[Lewis F. Powell]]. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote a dissent joined by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. Stevens also wrote a dissent joined by Brennan and Marshall.

===Majority opinion===
The issue in ''Bowers'' involved the right of [[privacy]]. Since 1965's ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'',&lt;ref name=Griswold&gt;{{ussc|name=Griswold v. Connecticut|volume=381|page=479|pin=|year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Bowers'', the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in ''Bowers'', written by Justice [[Byron White]], framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers “a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.” The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that “to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.”

Justice White added a [[slippery slope]] warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [p196] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to start down that road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chief Justice Burger's concurrence===
The short concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir [[William Blackstone]]’s characterization of sodomy as “a crime not fit to be named”.&lt;ref name="concurrence"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Burger concluded, “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”

===Justice Powell's concurrence===
In a concurring opinion, Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. But he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia's law with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.

Powell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk [[Michael W. Mosman]] advised him to uphold the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-9252-domestic_partner_decision_revisiting_old_wounds.html Domestic Partner Decision: Revisiting Old Wounds?], ''Willamette Week''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Powell's decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any [[homosexual]]s, even though one of his own law clerks was gay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lazarus|Lazarus, Edward]]. ''[[Closed Chambers]]: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,'' p. 386. “At the ''Bowers'' conference, Powell told his colleagues that he had ‘never met a homosexual’.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Extreme Makeover: The story behind the story of Lawrence v. Texas |author=Dahlia Lithwick |date=12 March 2012 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/03/12/120312crbo_books_lithwick?google_editors_picks=true |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that clerk has said that Powell had met his boyfriend, and that Powell had asked him about the mechanisms of homosexual sex when deciding the case. He felt that Powell had made the remark in order to avoid revealing that one of his clerks was gay at a time when such a revelation could have destroyed that clerk's future legal career. Journalists have since found that Powell hired more gay law clerks than any of the other justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exhibit ''A'' for a Major Shift: Justices’ Gay Clerks |date=June 10, 2013 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/exhibit-a-for-a-major-shift-justices-gay-clerks.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=recg |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissents===

====Justice Blackmun's dissent====
A sharply worded dissenting opinion by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] attacked the majority opinion as having an "almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity". Blackmun wrote, "Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is 'a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality{{'-}}” (ironically quoting from Burger's opinion in ''[[Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton]]'', which held that obscene films are not constitutionally protected). The dissent compared the majority opinion to that in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Minersville School District v. Gobitis|volume=310|page=586|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was reversed by the Court after only three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|volume=319|page=624|pin=|year=1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun revealed in a 1995 [[oral history]] with [[Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh]] that his dissent in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' was written primarily by [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/groups-push-for-first-gay-justice-022106|title=Groups push for first gay justice|work=POLITICO|date=2009-05-05|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/stanford-law-professor-pam-karlan-concludes-2006-acs-national-convention|title=Stanford Law Professor Pam Karlan Concludes 2006 ACS National Convention {{!}} ACS|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en|date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela S. Karlan|Pamela Karlan]] (then Blackmun's clerk and now a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]]). Blackmun said of the dissent, "Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_04_17-2005_04_23.shtml#1114025448 |title=The Volokh Conspiracy |publisher=Volokh.com |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justice Stevens's dissent====
Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote a separate dissent that focused on the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref name=Griswold/&gt; Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.

====Subsequent findings====
According to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]] and Rustin's openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall's decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a "no-brainer", and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that "this [case] is controlled by [[Stanley v. Georgia|''Stanley'']]".{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=292}}

==Subsequent events==

===Jurisprudence===
''Bowers'' was decided at a time when the court's privacy jurisprudence, and in particular the right to abortion recognized in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had come under heavy criticism. ''Bowers'' signaled a reluctance by the Court to recognize a general constitutional right to privacy or to extend such a right further than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franke |first=Katherine |title=Dignifying Rights: A Comment on Jeremy Waldron's 'Dignity, Rights, and Responsibilities' |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/faculty_franke/Dignifying%20Rights%20%28Final%20Proof%29.pdf |publisher=Columbia Law School |accessdate=12 June 2013 |page=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia law upheld in ''Bowers'' criminalized oral sex and anal sex whether engaged in by people of the same sex or different sexes, but White's decision was restricted to homosexual sex. “The only claim properly before the Court, therefore, is Hardwick’s challenge to the Georgia statute as applied to consensual homosexual sodomy. We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.” State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of [[gay]] people.&lt;ref name="keen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Strangers to the Law: Gay People on Trial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keen-law.html |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Lisa Keen |author2=Susanne B. Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bowers'' was used to deny suspect class qualification to gays and lesbians, thus restricting the standard of review to rational basis. Although ''Bowers'' was later overruled, decisions based on it, such as ''[[High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office |vol=895 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=563 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1990 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/895/563/46921/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes still cited as precedent in gay rights cases.

===Justice Powell's later comments===
In 1990, three years after retiring from the Court, Powell told a group of [[New York University]] law students that he considered his opinion in ''Bowers'' an error. “I do think it was inconsistent in a general way with ''Roe''. When I had the opportunity to reread the opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments."&lt;ref name = shilts&gt;Shilts, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; But Powell believed the case was one of little importance and in 1990 said he hadn't devoted thirty minutes to thinking about it since the ruling.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price}}

===Repeal of state sodomy laws===
In the years after ''Bowers'' was decided, several state legislatures repealed their sodomy laws. In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. The same sodomy law that was upheld in ''Bowers'' was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court under the Georgia state constitution in the case of ''[[Powell v. Georgia|Powell v. State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Powell v. State |vol=270 |reporter=Ga. |opinion=327 |pinpoint= |court=Ga. |date=1998 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1338934/powell-v-state/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keen"/&gt;

====''Lawrence v. Texas''====
The remaining 13 state sodomy laws in the U.S. were invalidated, insofar as they applied to private consensual conduct among adults, by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence/&gt; which explicitly overturned ''Bowers''. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence]]'', ruling that Texas's state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one's home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: “''Bowers'' was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' should be and now is overruled.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lawrence'', 539 U.S. at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media portrayal===
[[Bill Moyers]] discussed the decision at length in an interview with Blackmun on the episode "Mr. Justice Blackmun" of the 1987 Constitutional bicentennial documentary miniseries ''In Search of the Constitution''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://billmoyers.com/content/mr-justice-blackmun-supreme-court/ Mr. Justice Blackmun (April 16, 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a play based on the life of Michael Hardwick and the judicial proceedings, ''Sodomy Rules: The Bowers v. Hardwick Trial'', was written and performed by Bill Crouch in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carol Polcovar and Festival Participants: Fresh Fruit Festival, June 28, 2009|url=http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130062125/http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 30, 2013|publisher=nytheater.com|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The last name of the satirical character Betty Bowers, played by [[Deven Green]], is taken from this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

===Hastening LGBTQ rights advocacy===
The decision was a watershed moment in LGBTQ rights, leading to renewed organizing, and directly to the formation of advocacy groups such as [[PROMO]].

{{Childcare}}
'''Child care''', or otherwise known as '''daycare''', is the care and supervision of a child or multiple children at a time, whose age ranges from six weeks to thirteen years. Child care is the action or skill of looking after children by a day-care center, nannies, babysitter, teachers or other providers. Child care is a broad topic that covers a wide spectrum of professionals, institutions, contexts, activities, social and cultural conventions. Early child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of [[child development]]. Child care providers can be children's first teachers, and therefore play an integral role in systems of [[early childhood education]]. Quality care from a young age can have a substantial impact on the future successes of children. The main focus of childcare is on the development of the child, whether that be mental, social, or psychological.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|year=2011|isbn=|location=Elk Grove Village|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases children are taken care of by their parents, legal guardians, or siblings. In some cases, it is also seen that children care for other children. This informal care includes verbal direction and other explicit training regarding the child's behavior, and is often as simple as "keeping an eye out" for younger siblings.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"&gt;[Weisner, Thomas S., et al. “My Brother's Keeper: Child and Sibling Caretaking [and Comments and Reply].” Current Anthropology, vol. 18, no. 2, 1977, pp. 169–190., doi:10.1086/201883.]&lt;/ref&gt; Care facilitated by similar-aged children covers a variety of developmental and psychological effects in both caregivers and charge. This is due to their mental development being in a particular case of not being able to progress as it should be at their age.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This care giving role may also be taken on by the child's [[extended family]]. Another form of childcare that is on the rise in contrast to familial caregiving is that of center based child care.In lieu of familial care giving, these responsibilities may be given to paid-caretakers, [[orphanage]]s or [[foster homes]] to provide care, housing, and schooling.

Professional caregivers work within the context of a center-based care (including creches, [[daycare]], [[preschools]] and schools) or a home-based care ([[nannies]] or family daycare). The majority of child care institutions that are available require that child care providers to have extensive training in [[first aid]] and be [[CPR]] certified. In addition, [[background checks]], [[drug testing]] at all centers, and [[Background check|reference verification]] are normally a requirement. Child care can consist of advanced learning environments that include [[early childhood education]] or [[elementary education]]. “The objective of the program of daily activities should be to foster incremental developmental progress in a healthy and safe environment and should be flexible to capture the interests of the children and the individual abilities of the children.” &lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In many cases the appropriate child care provider is a teacher or personal with educational background in child development, which requires a more focused training aside from the common core skills typical of a child caregiver.

As well as these licensed options, parents may also choose to find their own [[caregiver]] or arrange childcare exchanges/swaps with another family.&lt;ref&gt;ChildForum Childcare Information http://www.childforum.com/options-a-differences-between-ece-programmes/73-private-childcare-arrangements-making-your-own-and-what-is-involved.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===In the child's home===
At home, care is typically provided by [[nannies]], [[au pair]]s, or friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AuPair Nanny Differences Au Pair Jobs {{!}} Family Care: Nanny, Sitter, Assistant, Senior Home Care|url = http://www.greataupair.com/nanny-aupair-agency/AuPair-Nanny-Differences.htm|website = www.greataupair.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child is watched inside their own home which could expose them to outside children and illnesses. Depending on the number of children in the home, the children utilizing in-home care could enjoy the greatest amount of interaction with their caregiver, in turn forming a close bond. There are no required licensing or background checks for in-home care, making parental vigilance essential in choosing an appropriate caregiver. Nanny and au pair services provide certified caregivers and the cost of in-home care is the highest of childcare options per child, though a household with many children may find this the most convenient and affordable option. Many nannies study towards childcare qualifications. This means they are trained to create a safe and stimulating environment for your child to enjoy and thrive in. Typically, au pairs or nannies provide more than routine child care, often providing assistance with daily household activities which include running errands, shopping, doing laundry, fixing meals, and cleaning the house.

The most now common way to find a nanny is via the childcare website/care website or a nanny agency. Nanny agencies will thoroughly check an applicant's references and run a criminal background check on the successful candidate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nannycity.com/checking-nanny-references/&lt;/ref&gt; Having a nanny could be cheaper than putting multiple children in a daycare setting full-time. Nannies could provide stability for the child who gets to have a regular role model in their life. Nannies often work overtime and babysit, providing less stress for parents running late without being charged excessive late fees. They also care for sick children whereas nurseries do not. This enables the parents to continue working normally without being interrupted. All nannies have first aid and background checks which are either checked by the agency or the family themselves. They can be subject to visits from their local childcare regulatory bodies. Children with nannies could also be well socialized as nannies could be able to take them out and attend more playdates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daycare vs. Nanny care: The Pros and Cons|url=http://www.pregnancy.org/article/daycare-vs-nannycare-pros-and-cons|publisher=Parents With Nannies, Inc.|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the provider's home===
Family child care providers care for children in the provider's own home. The children could be in a mixed age group with a low adult to child ratio. Care can also potentially be personalized and individual. The hours may be more flexible and the provider may offer evening and weekend care for parents who [[Shift work|work shifts]]. The cost in a family child care could be significantly lower on average than that of a center.

Child care facilities in the US have the option of becoming accredited. This standard is set and regulated by an outside agency. In centers, [[National Association for the Education of Young Children]] institutes it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NAEYC.org National Association for the Education of Young Children].&lt;/ref&gt; For family child care providers, the [[National Association of Family Child Care]] Providers award the credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nafcc.org National Association of Family Child Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensed or unlicensed home daycare is also referred to as family child care, or in home care. It refers to the care provided to a group of children in the home of a caregiver. State laws differ regarding rules for licensed versus unlicensed care. In Canada, most home daycares are unlicensed, and this is completely lawful. Licensing home daycares in Canada can help greatly with oversight, but at the cost of a large portion of the daycare provider's pay. Family child cares are small in size and provide families the same securities as a daycare center, and also has the benefits of flexible hours, lower costs, accessibility, and cultural compatibility. Home-based providers can give more individualized care and therefore better meet the needs of working families. In addition, family care generally has a small ratio of children in care, allowing for more interaction between child and provider than would be had at a commercial care center. Family child care helps foster emotionally secure [[interpersonal relationship]]s for everyone involved. The providers are able to communicate each day with parents on a personal level and share information about the development of the child. Providers care for multi-aged groups of children allowing children to remain with one caregiver for many years which helps children develop a sense of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and security. Multi-aged settings allow children to learn from one another and allow siblings to stay together. Some family child care providers may offer parents more flexibility with hours of operation such as evening, weekend, overnight, and before and after school care. In the United States, some family child care providers work with companies such as Wonderschool, for assistance in licensing, operations, marketing, and administrative support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Magistretti| first = Berenice| title = Wonderschool raises $2 million to launch in-home preschools| url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/19/wonderschool-raises-2-million-to-launch-in-home-preschools/| website = Venture Beat| date = 19 June 2017| access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center Based childcare===
[[File:Childcare Development Center-Crestwood High School cheerleaders 120815-F-PG936-400.jpg|thumb|An American childcare development center]]
In a childcare center, teachers focus on the physical and mental developments of their students. In order to have a greater understanding of the student, teachers in centers must incorporate a relationship with their students that benefits their wants and needs while pushing them toward a higher set of values. This type of teaching with a caring relationship will improve a student's moral and incidental learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~rgriffin/NoddingsCaring.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial care center also known as daycares are open for set hours, and provide a standardized and regulated system of care for children. Parents may choose from a commercial care center close to their work, and some companies may even offer care at their facilities. A form in which parents pick the child care facility can be based on their mission statement and the objectives they find necessary to be addressed. Center based child care should have their mission written out and include one of the main components which is health promotion.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; These objectives should be shaped to the needs of every child and can change from one to another. The child care provider must see how these objectives are most fit for the child and mend them case by case to their specific needs. In setting up activities for these objectives, both indoor and outdoor activities must be taken into account.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The child must have an experience that partakes in all the different forms. This may then cause discussion between the parents and the caregivers.The parents tend to give their input on what they deem as necessary when the needs of their children may be different.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeon|first=Michael|date=23 February 2013|title=The Morality of Daycare|url=|journal=Philosophia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are able to communicate with the staff of these facilities because workers who speak the same native language or language of preference must be available for these conversations.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The quality of the center based child care can be very influential on the child and on their overall development. Recent study showed that children in low end classrooms saw the activities as forced while the children in high end classrooms had more memorable experiences.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltz|first=Nancy W.|date=2001|title="What do you do in child care?"

[[Pre-school]] is often the term used to refer to child care centers that care primarily for 3 and 4-year old children. Preschool can be based in a center, family child care home or a public school.  Older children, in their turn, in most countries are cared in an educational setting, usually a [[primary school]] environment. The children are supervised by a teacher all day long, who is responsible for their physical, intellectual, emotional and social development. In this regard, most western countries have [[compulsory education]] during which the great majority of children are at school starting from five or six years of age. The school will act ''[[in loco parentis]]'' meaning "in [[list of French words and phrases used by English speakers|lieu]] of parent supervision." In many locales, government is responsible for monitoring the quality of care.

==== Staff ====
For all providers, the largest expense is labor. In a 1999 Canadian survey of formal child care centers, labor accounted for 63% of costs and the industry had an average profit of 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doorwaystocare.ca|title=Doorways To Care|date=2012-01-22|publisher=doorwaystocare.ca|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the labor-intensive nature of the industry, it is not surprising that the same survey showed little [[economies of scale]] between larger and smaller operators.

Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. Laws may mandate staffing ratios (for example 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 months to 18 months, 1:5; 18 months to 24 months, 1:9; et and even higher ratios for older children). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Typically, once the child reaches the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Many employees are at local [[minimum wage]] and are typically paid by the hour rather than [[salary|salaried]]. In the United States, "child care worker" is the fifth most female-dominated occupation (95.5% female in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf|title=Evidence From Census 2000 About Earnings by Detailed Occupation for Men and Women. Census 2000 Special Reports, May 2004.|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, staffing requirements vary from state to state.

===Non-profit daycare===
[[File:The Daycare circa 2009.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A daycare in 2009.]]
"Considerable research has accumulated showing that not-for-profits are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive."&lt;ref name="The Star" /&gt; Not-for-profit organizations are more likely to provide good services to a vulnerable population under conditions that are very hard to monitor or measure.

*[[Non-profit]] day cares have some structural advantages over for-profit operations:
**They may receive preferential treatment in rents especially if they are affiliated with a church that is otherwise unoccupied during the week, or with a school that has surplus space.
**Location within a school may have the advantage of coordinated programs with the school and the advantage of a single location for parents who have older school-age children as well.
**Parents are typically the legal owners of the non-profit day care and will routinely provide consulting services in areas in which they are professionally qualified (for example accounting, legal advice, or human resources) for free. (There are some non-profits not operated by parents, but by a board of directors made up of community representatives who want what is good for the children.)
**Non-profits have an advantage in fund-raising, as most people will not donate to a for-profit childcare organization.
**Non-profits, however, are typically limited in size to a single location, as the parent-owners have no motivation to manage other locations where their children are not present.
**They may suffer from succession issues as children grow and parents leave the management of the day care to other parents.

Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers. In non-profits, the title of the most senior supervisor is typically "executive director", following the convention of most non-profit organizations.

===Family child care homes===
Family child care homes can be operated by a single individual out of their home. In most states, the legal age of 18 is only required. There may be occasions when more than one individual cares for children in a family childcare home.  This can be a stay-at-home parent who seeks supplemental income while caring for their own child. There are also many family childcare providers who have chosen this field as a profession.  Both state and county agency legislation regulate the ratios (number and ages of children) allowed per family child care home.  Some counties have more stringent quality standards that require licensing for family child care homes while other counties require little or no regulations for childcare in individuals' homes. Some family child care homes operate illegally with respect to tax legislation where the care provider does not report fees as income and the parent does not receive a receipt to qualify for childcare tax deductions. However, licensing a family child care home is beneficial for family child care home providers so that they can have access to financial benefits from their state government, or the federal government where they are allowed to accept children from parents who meet the criterion to benefit from the government childcare subsidy funding. Examples of such benefits are: free Professional Development and training courses, Child And Adult Care Food Program (which allows eligible childcare and family childcare home providers to claim a portion of costs relating to nutritious meals served to children), and more;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daycareunitedstates.com/|title=State By State Daycare Search, City By City Daycare Search, Search Daycare Centers and Daycare Homes, Daycare Listings, Child Care Directory, Daycare Locations|date=|publisher=Daycareunitedstates.com|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family childcare may be less expensive than center-based care because of the lower overhead (lower ratios mean less staff are required to maintain regulated ratios. Many family childcare home providers may be certified with the same credentials as center based staff potentially leading to higher level of care.

[[Franchising]] of family child care home facilities attempts to bring economies of scale to home daycare. A central operator handles marketing, administration and perhaps some central purchasing while the actual care occurs in individual homes. The central operator may provide training to the individual care providers. Some providers even offer enrichment programs to take the daycare experience to a more educational and professional level. An example would be Wonderschool, which provides caregivers with a proprietary technology platform, as well as licensing, marketing, and administrative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robynshulman/2017/06/20/how-this-startup-is-disrupting-preschool-and-turning-teachers-into-entrepreneurs/#935c1c73fcba|title=How this startup is disrupting preschool and turning teachers into entrepreneurs|last=Shulman|first=Robyn|date=20 June 2017|website=Forbes|access-date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal care===
Informal childcare is a childcare system that utilizes both family and community members. This includes but is not limited to grandparents, siblings, and both children and adult neighbors. This system is inexpensive and many cultures utilize and embrace informal childcare as beneficial to a child's upbringing and education.

Children that receive informal care do not receive the same educational and preparatory regimens as those in a center- or home-based center often do. Instead, learning occurs informally as a direct result of the caretaker and charge's interactions. Learning and development occur differently for every individual. Different periods of a child's growth are known to affect the care taking styles associated with them, from the care of an infant to that of an older adolescent. Other influences on care taking include the expectations of the three parties involved- the parents, caretakers, and children.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

====Children caring for adults====
Many types of childcare discuss the different ways in which children are cared for by adults or older children. One additional type of child care involves children caring for adults. Children as caretakers are most often seen in developing countries with restricted or hard-to-access medical assistance. Child caretakers are common in families where the parents are affected by [[HIV/AIDS]] and other mental illnesses that might limit their parental functioning.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Evans, Ruth, and Saul Becker. “Children’s and Young People’s Caring Responsibilities within the Family.” Policy Press at the University of Bristol, 2009, pp. 1–38. Global Issues and Policy Responses, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgvzh.5. Accessed 7 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmentally, these child caretakers have shown certain positive associations that affect their future resilience in the face of adversity. Caring for disabled parents raises their sense of responsibility and maturity, increases social and life skills, fosters closer parent-child relationships, and enhances a child’s early sense of purpose. Children caring for sick or disabled parents also experience less anxiety surrounding their parents compared to children who have an additional caregiver for their disabled parent. This is because the children understand more about the illness and feel more in control over the situation.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Cultural Differences==

Childcare varies dramatically across cultures. These discrepancies are attributed to the homestead and household environments. That is, the type of work performed by adult caretakers in a given community strongly influence the type of childcare used. In agricultural/ horticultural societies where work is done to provide sustenance for the community, siblings and similar-aged children are responsible for younger children.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt; While many global communities prefer children aged 7–10 for designated caregiving responsibilities, children no younger than 12 are preferred in the Western world where paid childcare is common.&lt;ref name="Rogoff, Barbara 2003"&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. “4: Child Rearing in Families and Communities.” The Cultural Nature of Human Development, Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors of childcare that vary cross-culturally are the relative ages of both caretaker and child, parental expectations, demands of the child, culturally-varied conceptions of children’s maturity, and factors affecting demographic makeup.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

=== Multi-cultural Care ===

An important aspect that many center based child cares have been trying to implement into their mission statement and everyday routine has been of being aware of the multiple cultures they will be dealing with. This was seen as being important because of the growing numbers of families considering and seeking childcare. Childcare has become an important aspect of society since, “Over thirteen million American children under 5 years of age experience some form of child care before entering formal school.”&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  Programs must understand similarities and differences between cultures/ ethnic groups. This must be done to understand the overall diversity of the community.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Children should be able to have their cultural practices represented as well as be able to learn about other cultures they have not been exposed to. This is of great importance because it adds to their mental development and their understanding of the world.

===England===
{{Main|Child care in the United Kingdom}}
In England, childcare is inspected and regulated by [http://www.OFSTED.gov.uk OFSTED]  (previously this was administered by Local Authority Social Services). Care for children under five is split into Childcare on Domestic Premises which is Childminding and Daycare. In the UK being a ‘Childminder’ is a protected title and can only be used by registered professionals. Registered Childminders are trained, insured and qualified in Pediatric First Aid. They comply/administer/work with The Early Years Foundation Stage [http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/search/earlyyears/results/nav:46528 EYFS] and have the same responsibilities for education as nurseries and reception classes. They generally work from their own homes and are always self-employed setting their own terms and conditions. The basic numbers of children that childminders can care for is 6 children under 8 years of age; of these children, 3 may be under 5 and of these 1 may be under 1. These numbers include the childminder's own children (although the childminder’s children will not be included in the childminding ‘Certificate’). Some childminders work with either childminding assistants or with co-childminders, which often increases the number of children that can be cared for and individual childminders can request a ‘variation’ which may increase the children that they care for particularly for ‘continuity of care’ or for twins. There is a professional body – the  [http://www.pacey.org.uk Professional Association for Childcare &amp; Early Years] (formerly the National Childminding Association), which “Promotes and supports quality child-minding expertise” and provides information for Childminders and parents. London has greater pressures on childcare provision than other English regions. A recent study by London’s Poverty Profile found the level of childcare provision in London is lower than the England average. In London, there are 4.4 children aged under 8 per childcare place, compared to the England average of 3.9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/indicators/topics/11-services/childcare-availability-by-borough/&lt;/ref&gt;

Childcare costs in London significantly hinder the living standards of the capital’s residents. A recent study by Loughborough University, funded by Trust for London, found the minimum budget required for a couple with two children to reach a decent standard of living is 22% more in Inner London and 21% more in Outer London than compared with the rest of the UK. The significantly higher costs of childcare influences this heavily, along with housing and transport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/research/minimum-income-standard-for-london/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
In Scotland [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]] is responsible for improving care and education for children from birth to age eighteen. This is implemented by inspections carried out by HMIE itself or by other members of inspection and review teams. Inspection reports include feedback from staff and parents as well as the inspectors, aiming to provide parents and carers information to help them decide whether a particular child care setting is providing good quality child care and meeting government standards.&lt;ref name="VeryTogether: Childproof Your Home!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verytogether.com/family/babies/childproof-your-home.html|title= Childproof Your Home!|publisher= VeryTogether.com | date = 3 April 2009|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Child care can cost up to $15,000 for one year in the United States. The average annual cost of full-time care for an infant in center-based care ranges from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="The Cost of Child Care"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cost of Child Care|url=http://singlemotherguide.com/cost-of-child-care/|publisher=Single Mother Guide|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In monetary- and production-based societies, informal childcare is seen in families who do not have enough funds to finance placing their children in a more expensive child care facility. A study done by Roberta Iversen and Annie Armstrong explains that due to long and irregular working hours of working parents, low- socioeconomic families are more likely to utilize informal childcare.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, Roberta Rehner, and Annie Laurie Armstrong. 2006. ''Jobs Aren't Enough: Toward a New Economic Mobility for Low-Income Families.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those low income families are also more apt to work longer hours on an irregular and inflexible schedule, which ultimately makes using a childcare facility, that has regular business hours, unlikely.

In 2001, more than one half of the children in the United States attended childcare facilities. This number has only increased as the number of working parents has increased. The increase in the number of children that are required to have some sort of childcare service has made childcare facilities more necessary than they have ever been.&lt;ref&gt;Yazejian, Noreen, et al. "The Relation Of Preschool Child-Care Quality To Children's Cognitive And Social Developmental Trajectories Through Second Grade." Child Development 72.5 (2001): 1534. Education Research Complete. Web. 16 October 2013.  
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Childcare systems in France put great value into childcare providers having received a certain level of formal education in order to properly care for children. They have two separate branches of early childhood childcare. These two branches are called crèche and école maternelle. Crèche is the program for infants and toddlers and école maternelle is part of the education system. They both require teachers to have a college degree with an occasional specialized degree on top of that.&lt;ref name="Cohn, Jonathan 2013"/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
Many agricultural communities highly value sibling- and peer- caretaking. Accounts from the [[Idakho tribe]] in [[Kenya]] portray infants being left to the care and guidance of other relatively young children in the community with adults and other tribe members merely within shouting distance should a problem arise. The same pattern of caregiving is seen in the [[Kikuyu people]] in Kenya, where mothers in the horticultural society are often away working, which relies on siblings, cousins, and neighbors to care for children as young as 4 months old.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

The children caregivers in many communities are deemed responsible to care for those younger than them and it is expected that they will do so. Adults are viewed as occasional supervisors of the caregiving while the caregivers are responsible for responding to the needs of each child. These young caregivers take pride in their responsibility and learn each child’s individual likes, dislikes, and habits.&lt;ref name="Rogoff, Barbara 2003"/&gt;

==Effects on child development==
===Formal Care===
There are many things to consider when parents enroll a child into a care center or other form of paid childcare, and there is much controversy surrounding the potential benefits and harm caused by this type of care. The parental decisions of leaving a child with someone and who that someone will be are two of the most difficult decisions in the lives of most parents.&lt;ref name="Cohn, Jonathan 2013"&gt;Cohn, Jonathan. "The Hell Of American Day Care. (Cover Story)." New Republic 244.6 (2013): 20. MAS Ultra - School Edition. Web. 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A parent must consider the safety and security of their children when making this decision. The development of a child has many factors, but it is most directly influenced by the type and quality of care that is most regularly provided to the child.

Child development researcher, Lian Tong, analysed the results from a Haley and Stansbury experiment saying, "Parent responsiveness also facilitates cognitive, social, and emotional development and reduces negative emotions in infants."&lt;ref name="Tong, Lian 2012"&gt;Tong, Lian, et al. "Early Development of Empathy in Toddlers: Effects of Daily Parent–Child \Interaction and Home-Rearing Environment." Journal of applied Social Psychology. 42.10 (2012): 2457-2478. Web. 8 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the amount of time that a parent or teacher is willing to spend teaching, listening to, playing with, and exploring with the child the more socially, emotionally, and educationally developed the child will become. Whether that child receives the majority of his or her care at a center or at its house, the biggest factor in deciding what will have the best effect on the child will be those willing to put in the time and effort it takes to properly develop a child's social, physical, and academic skills.

The quality of childcare given by a facility is generally indicated by the center's cost of enrollment.  If the center charges more for the service, it will generally provide better care to the children.  Centers that charge more for their services can provide quality education, more current resources, and nicer facilities. These are all helpful when trying to educate a child academically.  A higher standard for teachers, such as requiring a degree in early childhood education or a degree of the like, has shown to result in improved growth in the development of a child.

Whether at an expensive facility or relatively inexpensive, children who attend daycare facilities tend to develop social skills more quickly than children of the same age group that are reared at home.  They communicate better with children of the same age and often try harder to communicate with those that are younger than them, by using patience and taking different approaches at presenting the data.&lt;ref&gt;Radboud University Nijmegen. "Children who go to daycare may benefit from a wider variety of social situations." ScienceDaily, 30 August 2013. Web. 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly, a study done by Erik Dearing, has proven that negative social behavioral patterns are not directly connected to daycare. By studying a large selection of children from the Norwegian childcare system he concluded that the number of hours a child spends at a daycare and their behavior have no dependent relations.&lt;ref&gt;Dearing, Erik, et al. "New study challenges links between daycare and behavioral issues." ScienceDaily, 17 January 2013. Web. 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   Though in America, children who attend childcare systems have a higher risk of externalizing the symptoms of negative social behavior, exhibiting these traits can directly correlate with their time spent in the center.&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, Gwen. "The Dark Side of Preschool:." The Dark Side of Preschool. N.p., 2013. Web. 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are links between the income, education, and importance of consistency and the well being of the child, to the parents, and the development of their child.  Higher educated parents place more importance on the education of their children than the parents who do not have a college degree or have not graduated from high school.  Likewise, parents who have a higher income level are more willing to part with their money to purchase a private tutor or nanny to assist the parent in the education of their child.  They also tend to stress the importance of being socially inept.&lt;ref name="Tong, Lian 2012"/&gt;  The first few years of a child's life are important to form a basis for good [[education]], [[morality]], [[self-discipline]] and [[social integration]]. Consistency of approach, skills and qualifications of caregivers have been shown in many studies to improve the chances of a child reaching his or her full potential. Child care in much of western society is currently in crisis: there are not enough daycare spots, the cost for most parents is beyond their means, and child care staff are grossly underpaid. Starting wages for Early Childcare Educators start at $11 or $12, causing a high turnover rate, and decreases the likelihood of potentially safe, effective, and loving child care providers from even entering the field. For preschool teachers the average salary is about $28,570.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-troubling-pay-gap-early-childhood-teachers|title=Fact Sheet: Troubling Pay Gap for Early Childhood Teachers {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey done by [[HiMama]], 68% of for-profit child care organizations ranked 'Labor' as their top risk and 65% ranked 'Talent and Recruitment' as their top priority for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.himama.com/blog/benchmark-2017 The HiMama 2017 Child Care Benchmark Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal Care ===
Care given by unpaid providers in an informal setting affect multiple developmental and psychological dimensions in children. Whether the providers are the child’s siblings or a member of the family/community, research dictates this type of care influences factors such as sense achievement, affiliation, conformity, and individual interests.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

More specifically, further research indicates that children being cared for by siblings or similarly-aged children (a trend more commonly seen in agriculturally-based cultural communities) have certain psychological and developmental effects on those being cared for. These effects include but are not limited to: mother-child attachment, emergence of childhood developmental stages, formation of playgroups, development of social responsibility, sex differences, personality differences, cognition, and motivation and performance in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

==Health issues==
===Childcare infection===
{{main|Childcare infection}}
Childcare infection is the spread of [[infection]] during [[childcare]], typically because of contact among children in [[daycare]] or [[school]].&lt;ref name=Nesti&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesti|first1=MM|last2=Goldbaum|first2=M|title=Infectious diseases and daycare and preschool education.|journal=Jornal de pediatria|date=July–August 2007|volume=83|issue=4|pages=299–312|pmid=17632670|doi=10.2223/jped.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens when groups of children meet in a childcare environment, and there is an individual with an infectious disease who may then spread it to the entire group. Commonly spread diseases include [[influenza-like illness]] and enteric illnesses, such as diarrhea among babies using diapers. Illnesses and diseases may also include ringworm, head lice, and hand, feet, mouth disease. It is uncertain how these diseases spread, but [[hand washing]] reduces some risk of transmission and increasing hygiene in other ways also reduces risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren-Gash|first1=C|last2=Fragaszy|first2=E|last3=Hayward|first3=AC|title=Hand hygiene to reduce community transmission of influenza and acute respiratory tract infection: a systematic review.|journal=[[Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses]]|date=September 2013|volume=7|issue=5|pages=738–49|pmid=23043518|doi=10.1111/irv.12015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=MB|last2=Greig|first2=JD|title=A review of enteric outbreaks in child care centers: effective infection control recommendations.|journal=Journal of environmental health|date=October 2008|volume=71|issue=3|pages=24–32, 46|pmid=18990930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to social pressure, parents of sick children in childcare may be willing to give [[unnecessary medical care]] to their children when advised to do so by childcare workers and even if it is against the advice of health care providers.&lt;ref name="Rooshenas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rooshenas|first1=L|last2=Wood|first2=F|last3=Brookes-Howell|first3=L|last4=Evans|first4=MR|last5=Butler|first5=CC|title=The influence of children's day care on antibiotic seeking: a mixed methods study.|journal=The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|date=May 2014|volume=64|issue=622|pages=e302-12|pmid=24771845|doi=10.3399/bjgp14x679741|pmc=4001146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, children in childcare are more likely to take antibiotics than children outside of childcare.&lt;ref name="Rooshenas"/&gt;

==Value of unpaid childcare==
Parents spend a significant amount of time raising their children. These parents nurture and develop their children into being functional members of society. This hard work is not motivated by monetary gain. For centuries it has been assumed that women will stay home and take care of the children while their husbands go out and work. In most cases, the husbands get all the credit for providing for the family. However, the wife who is the homemaker, deserves just as much credit for her care work. Caregivers do not receive monetary compensation and they must pay a ‘care-penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy. The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values. New York: New, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A care-penalty is the price one pays for doing care work for a family member. Care giving demands a lot out of an individual, and as a result there is a high opportunity cost. The opportunity cost can relate to both time and money. Instead of taking care of a family member, a [[caregiver]] could spend time working or performing more leisure activities. Care penalties are not strictly related to childcare- they can also refer to taking care of a sick family member, babysitting a younger sibling, or taking an elderly family member on errands such as grocery shopping or doctor's appointments.

===Monetary Value===
Studies have been done to get an annual salary estimate for a female caregiver. One survey suggested that the value of a mother's work, if she were paid the average wage for each task she performs in running the household and caring for her children, is $117,867 per year.&lt;ref&gt;"Mom Salary Wizard?2010. Mother's Day Paycheck for Mom's Job." Web. &lt;http://swz.salary.com/momsalarywizard/htmls/mswl_momcenter.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the high salary is because mothers typically perform about 10 different job functions throughout the week.  Some of these job functions are poorly paid, including cleaning, driving, caring for children, and washing laundry, but others, especially financial and managerial tasks that the survey equated with being the [[Chief Executive Officer]] of a company, are highly paid.  Neither a nanny nor a housekeeper makes nearly as much money, and almost all of these tasks except direct child care also have to be done by non-parents. The value of unpaid childcare is also an important figure in various legal entities. Expert witnesses (most often economists) are occasionally brought into court cases to give estimates on the value of unpaid labor. By giving estimation, the plaintiff or defendant can be fairly compensated for their labor.

===Societal Value===
It is important to assess the value of caregivers because they are what truly make society function,&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy. "Valuing Unpaid Work Matters, Especially for the Poor - NYTimes.com." The Economy and the Economics of Everyday Life - Economix Blog - NYTimes.com. Web. &lt;https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/valuing-unpaid-work-matters-especially-for-the-poor/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and often their work is under-appreciated. They prepare the next generation for school, work, and decision-making. The way in which a child is nurtured at a young age and through adolescence has both psychological and developmental effects that effect their future. Not only does the child depend on caregiving, but schools and employers depend on the childcare. The government also benefits because these children turn into productive members of society. Eventually, they will be the ones running the country.

Developmental benefits are also seen for older siblings or relatives tasked to care for younger children.  For example, children with siblings are more likely to prohibit prosocial behaviors (such as the ability to take another's perspective or sharing with others) than children without siblings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Readings on the Development of Children", Mary Gauvain and Michael Cole&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, sibling caretakers have to opportunity to develop deeper communication skills as they teach younger siblings to participate in everyday tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==History==

According to [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], the first humans were few; then the population "exploded .... Population expansion on such a scale is inconsistent with female tolerance of infanticide, harassment, or the heavy costs to mothers of male philandering and double standards. If unusually large numbers of unusually large-brained offspring were being successfully raised to maturity, the quality of childcare must have been exceptional. We know what the optimal solution would have been. There can be no doubt that mothers would have done best by ... taking advantage of every available childcare resource."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, ''Early Human Kinship was Matrilineal'', in Allen, Nicholas J., Hillary Callan, Robin Dunbar, &amp; Wendy James, eds., ''Early Human Kinship: From Sex to Social Reproduction'' (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Publishing, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1-4051-7901-0}})), pp. 81-82 (author prof. anthropology, Univ. of East London).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, around 394 &lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;, argued that a system of child care would free women to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;Schönpflug, Karin, ''Feminism, Economics and Utopia: Time Travelling Through Paradigms'' (Oxon/London: Routledge, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-415-41784-6}})), pp. 159–160 (author economist, [[Austria]]n Ministry of Finance, &amp; lecturer, [[University of Vienna|Univ. of Vienna]]), citing Rohrlich, R. &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, ''Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers'' (N.Y.: Schocken Books, 1984), and Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] (''ca.'' 394 B.C.).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early English authors to devote a book to child care in the modern sense was [[Elizabeth Dawbarn]] (''The Rights of Infants, or... Nursing of Infants'', 1805).&lt;ref&gt;''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Day care''', '''daycare''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/day-care day care or daycare] in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=day+care daycare or day care] in the American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; '''child day care''', or '''childcare''' is the care of a child during the day by a person other than the child's [[legal guardian]]s, typically performed by someone outside the child's immediate [[family]]. Day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods, such as the parents' time at [[Employment|work]].

''Day care'' can also refer to daytime care for disabled or elderly people in both UK and US English,&lt;ref name=oedd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/day_care|title=day care - Definition of day care in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/day-care|title=Definition of DAY-CARE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; so ''child day care'' is often preferable at first mention.

The service is known as ''day care''&lt;ref name=oedd/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; or ''childcare''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/childcare|title=childcare - Definition of childcare in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mwcc/&gt; in the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia and as ''crèche'' in Ireland and New Zealand. According to Oxford Living Dictionaries, ''child care'' in two words can in addition have the broader meaning of the care of a child by anyone, including the parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/child_care|title=child care - Definition of child care in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; but US dictionaries do not record that spelling or meaning.&lt;ref name=rh&gt;https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/child-care Random House Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=child+care|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: child care|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mwcc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/child+care|title=Definition of CHILD CARE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English-speaking and other conservative countries, the vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nannies or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends, but most children are in daycare centers for most of the day in Nordic Countries, for example. Child care in the child's own [[household|home]] is traditionally provided by a [[nanny]] or [[au pair]], or by extended family members including grandparents, aunts and uncles. Child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a [[nanny]] or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes. It can also take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline and even [[preschool education]] falling into the fold of services.

The day care [[industry]] is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions. Some [[childminder]]s care for children from several families at the same time, either in their own home (commonly known as "family day care" in Australia) or in a specialized child care facility. Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment. For-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies. Research shows that not-for-profits are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive."&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/310203 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Child care must serve kids not corporate shareholders | first1=Martha | last1=Friendly | first2=Margaret | last2=McCain | date=March 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers. For all providers, the largest expense is labor. Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification. Legislation may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.).

Independent studies suggest that good daycare is not harmful.&lt;ref name="Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N 2000 727–47"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N |title=Maternal versus nonmaternal care and seven domains of children's development |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=727–47 |year=2000 |pmid=10989621 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.727}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two and are ready to interact with other children. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care.

=== Learning Stories ===
Learning Stories &lt;ref&gt;Carr, M. (2012) Learning stories : constructing learner identities in early education. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; are documents that are used by caregivers and educators in childcare settings. They use a storytelling format instead of a traditional ‘observation’ report to document the different ways that young children learn, and capture the moment in greater detail and provide parents with a greater insight into the events that occur in their child’s time in childcare.

'''What they include'''

* Story of the child’s progress
* Pictures of the experiences (Optional)
* The child’s strengths, interests and needs
* Space for parent feedback &lt;ref&gt;Kearns, K, 2010. Birth to Big School. 2nd ed. Frenchs Forest, NSW: Pearson Australia.",&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning stories originate from New Zealand as they use a learning model in their curriculum called "Te Whaariki". It highlights children's learning outcomes as 'disposition' which are “situated learning strategies plus motivation-participation repertoires from which a learner recognize, selects, edits, responds
to, resists, searches for and constructs learning opportunities” &lt;ref&gt;Blaiklock, K (2008) A critique of the use of learning stories to assess the learning dispositions of young children, NZ Research in ECE Journal, Vol. 11, pg 77-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Ryan. 2006.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:WWII daycare Richmond CA.jpg|thumb|250px|A worker drops off her child at a California day care center, 1943.]]
The first crèche was opened by [[Firmin Marbeau]] on 14 November 1844 in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = U.K. Board of Education | chapter = The Development of Infant Schools and of Separate Nursery Schools from 1905 to the Present Time | title = Early Years Education: Major Themes in Education | editor = Rod Parker-Rees and Jenny Willan | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-32669-9 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Société des Crèches was recognized by the French government in 1869. Originating in Europe in the late 18th and early 19th century, day cares were established in the United States by private charities in the 1850s, such as the Charity Organization Society founded by [[Ansley Wilcox]].  The Fitch Creche in [[Buffalo, New York]] was known as the first day center for working mothers in the United States. Another at that time was the New York Day Nursery in 1854.

More contemporary proposals for government advancement of day care in the United States have experienced a checkered path, for example, in 1971, the [[Comprehensive Child Development Act]] was passed by Congress, but was vetoed by Richard Nixon. It "would have created nationally funded child care centers providing early childhood services and after-school care, as well as nutrition, counseling, and even medical and dental care. The centers would charge parents on a sliding scale."&lt;ref&gt;Onion, Rebecca, ''[http://www.slate.com/blogs/better_life_lab/2017/06/14/anti_communism_and_its_role_in_america_s_lack_of_affordable_daycare.html Your Child Care Conundrum Is an Anti-Communist Plot]'', [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], June 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Various proposals have been considered, but to date, none leading to legislation that would establish a national policy supporting day care in the United States.

==Business==
The day care [[industry]] is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions.

The vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nanny or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends. For example, in [[Canada]], among two parent families with at least one working parent, 62% of parents handle the childcare themselves, 32% have other in-home care (nannies, relatives, neighbours or friends) and only 6.5% use a formal day care center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/Private%20Sector%20Can%20Meet%20Child%20Care%20Demands-Mar04fftaylor.pdf |title=The Fraser Institute |publisher=Fraserinstitute.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208184721/http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/Private%20Sector%20Can%20Meet%20Child%20Care%20Demands-Mar04fftaylor.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies. For instance, in North America, [[KinderCare Learning Centers]], one of the largest of such companies, has approximately 1,600 centers located in 39 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookroomreviews.com/tag/kindercare-learning-centers/ |title=KinderCare Learning Centers |publisher=Book Room Reviews |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bright Horizons Family Solutions]] another of the largest has over 600 daycare centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2003/commentary030918sm.htm |title=Bright Horizons for Bright Horizons |publisher=Fool.com |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]'s childcare subsidy has allowed the creation of a large private-sector industry in that country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mychild.gov.au/documents/docs/StateofChildCareinAustralia-web.pdf|title=Documents - MyChild.gov.au|website=www.mychild.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor favoring large corporate daycares is the existence of childcare facilities in the workplace. Large corporations will not handle this employee benefit directly themselves and will seek out large corporate providers to manage their corporate daycares. Most smaller, for-profit daycares operate out of a single location.

In general, the geographic limitations and the diversity in type of daycare providers make child daycare a highly fragmented industry. The largest providers own only a very small share of the market. This leads to frustration for parents who are attempting to find quality child daycare, with 87% of them describing the traditional search for child daycare as "difficult and frustrating".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Standards and requirements==
[[File:US Navy 050114-N-3659B-050 he Morale Welfare and Recreation Child Development Center on board Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tenn., provides daycare services.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A child playing with a toy in a daycare.]]
Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification.  Parents may also turn to independent rating services, or rely on recommendations and referrals.  Some places develop voluntary quality networks, for example in Australia most childcare services are part of a national Quality Assurance system. Some places require caregivers to take classes in [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and [[first aid]]. Most countries have laws relating to childcare, which seek to keep children safe and prevent and punish [[child abuse]].  Such laws may add cost and complexity to childcare provision and may provide tools to help ensure quality childcare.

Additionally, legislation typically defines what constitutes daycare (e.g., so as to not regulate individual babysitters). It may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.). The minimum window space may be such that it precludes day cares from being in a basement. It may specify the minimum floor space per child (for example 2.8 square metres) and the maximum number of children per room (for example 24). It may mandate minimum outdoor time (for example 2 hours for programs 6 hours or longer). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Some legislation also establishes rating systems, the number and condition of various toys, and documents to be maintained.&lt;ref name="ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us/parents/pr_sn2_ps.asp |title=Star Rated License: Program Standards |publisher=Ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723135940/http://ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us/parents/pr_sn2_ps.asp |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, once children reach the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

Legislation may mandate staffing ratios (for example, 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 months to 18 months, 1:5; 18 months to 24 months, 1:9; etc.). The caregiver-to-child ratio is one factor indicative of quality of care.  Ratios vary greatly by location and by daycare center. Potential consequences of a caregiver:child ratio which is too high could be very serious {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. However, many states allow a higher numbers of toddlers to caregivers and some centers do not comply consistently. For example, within the US: Pennsylvania, ages 1–3, 1 teacher to 5 children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/055/chapter3270/s3270.51.html |title=055 Pa. Code § 3270.51. Similar age level |publisher=Pacode.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri: age 2, 1 teacher to 8 children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daycare.com/missouri/ |title=Missouri Licensing Standards for Day Care Centers Homes |publisher=Daycare.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina: 1 teacher to 10 children.&lt;ref name="ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us"/&gt;

Many organizations in the developed world campaign for free or subsidized childcare for all. Others campaign for tax breaks or allowances to provide parents a non-finance driven choice. Many of the free or subsidized childcare programs in the United States are also Child Development programs, or afterschool programs which hire certified teachers to teach the children while they are in their care. There are often local industry associations that lobby governments on childcare policy, promote the industry to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childcaretoday.ca/aboutadcos7.php |title=About ADCO - ADCO :: The Association of Day Care Operators of Ontario :: Childcare Today |publisher=Childcaretoday.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or help parents choose the right daycare provider.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daycarematch.com/associations.asp{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, childcare in regulated commercial or family childcare home setting is administered or led by teachers who may have a [[Child Development Associate]] or higher credentials. These higher credentials include Associate, Bachelor, and even master's degrees in the field of Early Childhood Education (ECE).  Although childcare professionals may obtain a degree, many states require that they attend workshops yearly to upgrade their knowledge and skill levels. Many day cares require a teacher to obtain a certain amount of training. For example, Texas requires a minimum of 25 hours a year, and the first year as a teacher, you are required to have 50 hours.

==Worldwide ==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has a large child care industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echildcare.com.au/about/ |title=About This Site &amp;#124; The Australian Childcare Index |publisher=Echildcare.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in many locations (especially in inner-city suburbs of large cities and in rural areas) the availability is limited and the waiting periods can be up to several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Govt-misleading-parents-on-childcare/2007/01/04/1167777200891.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Govt 'misleading parents on childcare' | date=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]'s Child Care Subsidy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/child-care-subsidy |title=Centrelink website |publisher=Centrelink.gov.au |date=2018-08-15 |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; scheme provides generous assistance with child care costs, but this still leaves many families with a large out of pocket expense. The median weekly cost of centre-based long day care in 2013 was approximately A$364&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/research/ongoing/report-on-government-services/2014/child-care,-education-and-training/download-the-volume/rogs-2014-volumeb-child-care-education-and-training.pdf |title=Report on Government Services 2014 Volume B: Child care, education and training |publisher=Australian Productivity Commission |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which puts it out of the reach of lower income earners.&lt;ref&gt;https://ris.govspace.gov.au/files/2015/07/20150703-Published-Consultation-RIS-for-the-Child-Care-Assistance-Package.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulation is governed by the ACECQA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acecqa.gov.au/welcome |title=Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority |publisher=acecqa.gov.au |date=2013-12-07 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a federal government body, which acts as a central body for the state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acecqa.gov.au/regulatory-authorities1/national-registers |title=State and territory registers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratios are:

* 1:4 for infants, 
* 1:5 for 2 – 3 years old (since 31/12/2015, when it was 1:8) and 
* 1:11 for preschoolers (since 31/12/2015 when it was 1:10)

All childcare workers must have, or be undertaking, the minimum "Certificate III in Children's Services" in order to work in a centre ([[Recognition of Prior Learning]] is available to help qualify staff with many years experience, but no qualifications). (Common more advanced qualifications are "Diploma of Children's Services" and an Early Childhood Education degree).

Rules differ between states regarding family day care in Australia. To start a Family Day Care business in Victoria, an educator should be either having "Certificate III in Children's Services" or be actively working towards the same. Additionally, Current Police check, Current First Aid training, Insurance (specifically for family day care) is necessary for starting a family day care. The house should be safe for children. A group of 15 educators works under one Supervisor who must have a "Diploma in Children's Services".

===Canada===
[[Canada]] offers both private and subsidized daycare centers. Some shortages of subsidized openings can lengthen the time needed to find a suitable childcare provider. To counter this, government or private enterprise sometimes enable parents to look for available spaces online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gouv.qc.ca/services-en-ligne/localisateur/index_en.asp Childcare establishment locator &gt; MFA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/children/childcare.htm |title=City of Toronto: Child Care Finder |publisher=Toronto.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]] day-cares accept children ranging from 6 months old to 3 years old. 91.2% of 1-2 year old children are enrolled in different types of day-care institutions. Most of these are managed by a municipality and mostly government funded. The different types of institutions ranges from separate day-care institutions (''Vuggestue''), kindergartens with a day-care department (''Integrerede institutioner'') and in-home day-care (''Dagpleje'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flere børn bliver passet ude|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2014/NR146.pdf|website=Danmarks Statistik|publisher=Danmarks statistik|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-cares are play-based focusing on the children’s perspective and involvement in the day-to-day life. The day-cares are staffed by trained social educators or [[Pedagogy#Pedagogues|pedagogues]] (''pædagog'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vejledning om dagtilbud m.v.|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=168574|website=Retsinformation.dk|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

In [[Germany]], preschool education is the domain of the ''Kindertagesstätte'' (literally "children's day site", often shortened to ''Kita'' or ''KITA''), which is usually divided into the ''Kinderkrippe'' (crèche) for toddlers (age up to 3 years), and the ''Kindergarten'' for children who are older than three years and before school.  Children in their last Kindergarten year may be grouped into a ''Vorschule'' ("preschool") and given special pedagogic attention;  special preschool institutions comparable to the US-American kindergarten are the exception.

Kitas are typically run by public (i. e. communal) and "free" carriers (such as the churches, other religious organizations, social organizations with a background in the trade unions and profit-orientated corporations), and subsidized by the states (''Länder'').  In this case, the care is open to the general public—e. g. a Protestant or Muslim child may claim a place in a Kita run by the catholic church.

Preschool education, unlike school and university, is not in the exclusive domain of the states.  The federal government regulates daycare through the ''Kinder- und Jugendhilfegesetz (KJHG)'', which stipulates a legal claim to daycare:
* for children over the age of three and before school (i. e. Kindergarten;  this law became effective in 1996);
* for children under the age of three and before Kindergarten (i. e. Kinderkrippe;  this law becomes effective August 1, 2013).

Alternative daycare can be provided through ''Tagespflegepersonen'' (usually ''Tagesmütter'', "day mothers"), i. e. stay-at-home parents which provide commercial day care to other children.  This form of daycare is also federally regulated through the KJHG.

Preschool education (''Frühpädagogik'') is increasingly seen as an integral part of education as a whole;  several states such as [[Bavaria]] have released detailed educational plans for daycare carriers who claim state subsidies.  "Early pedagogics" has increasingly moved into the academic domain, with an increasing number of staff being trained at universities of applied science (''[[Fachhochschule]]n'') and regular universities.  Non-academic personnel in daycare facilities have usually attended specialized schools for several years.  In the state of Bavaria for example, daycare assistants (''Kinderpfleger'') will have attended school for two years, daycare teachers (''Erzieher'') for three years with an additional two-year internship.

===Japan===
In Japan, the child care industry is worth trillions of [[yen]], and is expanding due to rising work force participation by mothers. In 2004 nearly 2 million children were in some form of day care. ([https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/reports/market/pdf/2005_69_p.pdf Jetro])

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa created a Social Program named "Programa de Estancias Infantiles" that included more than 8,000 daycare spaces for children between 1 and 3.11 years old. This program subsidizes mothers that work and study and also single fathers in a vulnerable situation. It has a great success having more than 125,000 children over the country. This is regulated by the Social Development Minister (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social).[http://www.sedesol.gob.mx]

Childcare has been on the rise in Mexico due to the increasing interest it has within the people and the effect it has on the government. This is due to the rise of urban areas in developing countries and the need to keep up with the economic development.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Rebecca|last2=Levine|first2=Ruth|date=1992|title=The Effect of Household Structure on Women's Economic Activity and Fertility|url=|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has always been many child care services available but due to the high costs, they were mainly unavailable for the low income families.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Gabriela|date=April 2014|title=The Effects of Child Care Provision in Mexico|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-discursos/publicaciones/documentos-de-investigacion/banxico/%7B0AFBA0F8-0973-907E-9ED4-5AC6E445E064%7D.pdf|journal=Banco de México Documentos de Investigación|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare became a hot topic of discussion when more women were joining the workforce and the debate of how this would affect how the children would be raised.&lt;ref name=":124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staab|first=Silke|last2=Gerhard|first2=Roberto|date=May 2010|title=Childcare Service Expansion in Chile and Mexico: For Women or Children or Both?|url=|journal=Gender and Development Programme Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another topic of debate is how would the women pay for these expensive services while working minimum wage jobs or having limited times they could work, so the idea of subsidizes arose.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; In specific to the child, the topic of “street children”, how and where children should grow up, was debated, and if they should be allowed to be considered part of the street instead of a particular home.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gigengack|first=Roy|date=1994|title=Social Practices of Juvenile Survival and Mortality: Child Care Arrangements in Mexico City|url=|journal=Community Development Journal,|volume= 29. Num. 4|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was of great debate because it not only affects the child but also the community the child is in, since they usually seek out public spaces for shelter, food and play.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Childcare is generally broken into three general categories such as governmental institutions, religious organizations, and independent agencies (such as NGOS).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; All of these take on the same objectives which are “containment, paternalist cure approach and street education.”&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The creation of childcare programs in Mexico is quite different from others because it focuses on the “defeminization of labor and the defamilization of care.”&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; Female participation is a goal that the government has so it set in place many policies and modes to achieve this.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; The creation of a successful program of child care has been sought out and many different aspects have been changed over the years but it can be seen that there is an increase in early childhood education and care services (ECEC).&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; ECEC services can be broken down into three different time periods and models which were implemented. The first would be in the 1970s when the Institute for Social Security focuses on covering children for mothers who were covered by Social Security services.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This caused a huge gap in the children that could be covered due to the fairly large amount of women working in the informal sector and being denied these services. The second stage would be in the early 200s when the Ministry of Public education made preschool mandatory for all children from ages 3 to 5.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This was useful in theory because all of the children in this age range would be cared for, but in reality caused a strain in the amount of time that the parents had to go and work or dedicate their time elsewhere. The last stage would be in 2007 when the Ministry of Social Development created a childcare program in which was focuses on helping out children and mothers who were not covered by the social security services.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This was successful since it targeted low income families specifically. For families to be eligible for this service the mothers had to be working or searching for a job, the income was taken into consideration in comparison to that of minimum wage, and that they did not have any other access to services.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Gabriela|date=April 2014|title=The Effects of Child Care Provision in Mexico|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-discursos/publicaciones/documentos-de-investigacion/banxico/%7B0AFBA0F8-0973-907E-9ED4-5AC6E445E064%7D.pdf|journal=Banco de México Documentos de Investigación|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's participation in the workforce and be directly tied to the availability of childcare services and how it would affect their household.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt;

The program that was created in 2007 became known as the Federal Daycare Programme for Working Mothers.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This program allowed for subsidized home and community based childcare. The one running the care centers would only have to have a training component, which consisted of a psychological test and training courses to understand the principles of childcare, before being able to open their business in which they would be given money to furnish the facility as necessary for a safe caring center to be created.&lt;ref name=":124" /&gt; Another way this program was set into place was by subsidizing the care of non-profits, private for profits, or religious institutions who were based in the area of need.&lt;ref name=":124" /&gt;

=== Norway ===
Many children in [[Norway]] start daycare between 10 months and 3 years old. Funded parental leave for working parents is either 44 weeks with full pay, or 54 weeks with 80% pay (both up to a certain level only). The government guarantees daycare for all children that are at least 1 year old by 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/Selected-topics/kindergarden.html?id=1029 |title=Kindergarten |publisher=regjeringen.no |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage is still not 100%, but most regions are getting close (2011). There's a maximum price to enable all families to afford it.

===Spain===
[[Spain]] provides paid [[maternity leave]] of 16 weeks with 30-50% of mothers returning to work (most full-time) after this{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, thus babies 4 months of age tend to be placed in daycare centers. Adult-infant ratios are about 1:7-8 first year and 1:16-18 second year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Public preschool education is provided for most children aged 3–5 years in "Infantil" schools which also provide [[primary school]] education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Child care in the United Kingdom}}
The UK has a wide range of childcare options, including [[childminder]]s, day nurseries, [[Pre-school playgroup|playgroups]] and pre-school education at school.  It is regulated by [[Office for Standards in Education|OFSTED]] ([[CSSIW]] in Wales), which operates the application and inspection process for the sector.

Childcare is primarily funded by parents, however the Single Funding Formula (pre-school funding) can be used at some day nurseries, playgroups and schools for a maximum of 5 sessions per week, after a child reaches 3 years.  The government introduced a childcare allowance (vouchers) by which employers could make payments for childcare, prior to tax, on employees' wages.

Median rates (2011) are approximately £4.50 per hour for childminders, £7:5-£10 net per hour for nannies, £60-100 per week for au pairs and £35-£50 per day for day nurseries.

===United States===
State legislation may regulate the number and ages of children allowed before the home is considered an official daycare program and subject to more stringent safety regulations. Often the nationally recognized [[Child Development Associate]] credential is the minimum standard for the individual leading this home care program.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Each state has different regulations for teacher requirements. In some states, teachers must have an associate degree in child development. States with quality standards built into their licensing programs may have higher requirements for support staff such as teacher assistants. And in Head Start programs, by 2012, all lead teachers must have a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education.  States vary in the standards set for daycare providers, such as teacher to child ratios.

Family childcare can also be nationally accredited by the National Association of Family Childcare if the provider chooses to go through the process. National accreditation is only awarded to those programs who demonstrate the quality standards set forth by the NAFCC.

According to the 1995 [[U.S. Census Bureau]] [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP), over thirty-six percent of families of preschoolers with working mothers primarily relied on childcare in the home of a relative, family daycare provider or other non-relative. Almost twenty-six percent of families used organized childcare facilities as their primary arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/archive/child_care.shtml|title= Child care|publisher= Almanac of Policy Issues:  |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child care can cost up to $15,000 for one year in the United States. The average annual cost of full-time care for an infant
in center-based care ranges from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="The Cost of Child Care"/&gt;

==Child development==
{{Main|Child development}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Handicapped Event.jpg|thumb|left|A child care assistant holding the little girl and her [[Easter]] eggs.]] --&gt;
Independent studies suggest that good daycare for non-infants is not harmful.&lt;ref name="Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N 2000 727–47"/&gt;  In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two and are ready to interact with other children. Bad daycare puts the child at physical, emotional and attachment risk. Higher quality care was associated with better outcomes. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care. They were also somewhat more cooperative than those who experienced lower quality care during the first 3 years of life.

The National Institute of Health released a study in March, 2007 after following a group of children through early childhood to the 6th grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/mar2007/nichd-26.htm |title=Early Child Care Linked to Increases in Vocabulary, Some Problem Behaviors in Fifth and Sixth Grades, March 26, 2007 - National Institutes of Health (NIH) |publisher=Nih.gov |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the children who received a higher quality of childcare scored higher on 5th grade vocabulary tests than the children who had attended childcare of a lower quality.  The study also reported that teachers found children from childcare to be "disobedient", fight more frequently, and more argumentative.  The study reported the increases in both aggression and vocabulary were small. "The researchers emphasized that the children’s behavior was within the normal range and were not considered clinically disordered."

As a matter of social policy, consistent, good daycare, may ensure adequate [[early childhood education]] for children of less skilled parents. From a parental perspective, good daycare can complement good parenting.

A 2001 report showed that children in high-quality care scored higher on tests of language, memory and other skills than did children of stay-at-home mothers or children in lower-quality day care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/51682/ How the Media Perpetuate Women's Fears of Being a Bad Mother] in [[AlterNet]] May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study appearing in ''Child Development'' in July/August 2003 found that the amount of time spent in daycare before four-and-a-half tended to correspond with the child's tendency to be less likely to get along with others, to be disobedient, and to be aggressive, although still within the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2003/nichd-16.htm |title=NIH News--Child Care Linked To Assertive, Noncompliant, and Aggressive Behaviors--07/16/2003 |work=nih.gov |accessdate=27 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181352/http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2003/nichd-16.htm |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8624.00582 |title=Does Amount of Time Spent in Child Care Predict Socioemotional Adjustment During the Transition to Kindergarten? |journal=Child Development |volume=74 |issue=4 |publisher=Wiley |pages=976–1005 |date=July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collective action ''' refers to action taken together by a group of people whose [[goal]] is to enhance their status and achieve a common objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1917157/collective-action-problem|title=collective action problem - collective action|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term that has formulations and theories in many areas of the social sciences including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science and economics.

==The social identity model==
Researchers Martijn van Zomeren, Tom Postmes, and Russell Spears conducted a meta-analysis of over 180 studies of collective action, in an attempt to integrate three dominant socio-psychological perspectives explaining antecedent conditions to this phenomenon – injustice, efficacy, and identity.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = van Zomeren|first = M.|last2=Postmes|first2=T.|last3=Spears|first3=R.|title = Toward an integrative social identity model of collective action: A quantitative research synthesis of three socio-psychological perspectives |journal = Psychological Bulletin|volume = 134| issue = 4| pages = 504–535|year = 2008|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.504|pmid = 18605818|ref = harv|citeseerx = 10.1.1.576.5638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their resultant 2008 review article, an integrative Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA) was proposed which accounts for interrelationships among the three predictors as well as their predictive capacities for collective action.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; An important assumption of this approach is that people tend to respond to subjective states of disadvantage, which may or may not flow from objective physical and social reality.

===Perceived injustice===
Examining collective action through perceived injustice was initially guided by [[Relative deprivation theory|relative deprivation theory (RDT)]]. RDT focuses on a subjective state of unjust disadvantage, proposing that engaging in fraternal (group-based) social comparisons with others may result in feelings of relative deprivation that foster collective action. Group-based emotions resulting from perceived injustice, such as anger, are thought to motivate collective action in an attempt to rectify the state of unfair deprivation.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; The extent to which individuals respond to this deprivation involves several different factors and varies from extremely high to extremely low across different settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrom|first1=Elinor|title=Collective Action and the Evolution of Social Norms|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=14|issue=3|pages=137–158|doi=10.1257/jep.14.3.137|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meta-analysis results confirm that effects of injustice causally predict collective action, highlighting the theoretical importance of this variable.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt;

===Perceived efficacy===
Moving beyond RDT, scholars suggested that in addition to a sense of injustice, people must also have the objective, structural resources necessary to [[Resource mobilization|mobilize change]] through social protest. An important psychological development saw this research instead directed towards subjective expectations and beliefs that unified effort (collective action) is a viable option for achieving group-based goals – this is referred to as perceived collective efficacy. Empirically, collective efficacy is shown to causally affect collective action among a number of populations across varied contexts.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt;

===Social identity===
[[Social identity theory]] (SIT) suggests that people strive to achieve and maintain positive social identities associated with their group memberships.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Tajfel|first = H.|last2=Turner|first2=J.C.|title = An integrative theory of inter-group conflict. In W.G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.)|journal = The Social Psychology of Inter-group Relations|volume = |pages= 33–47|year = 1979|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a group membership is disadvantaged (for example, low status), SIT implicates three variables in the evocation of collective action to improve conditions for the group – permeability of group boundaries,&lt;ref name="Wright, Taylor &amp; Moghaddam (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Stephen C. Wright | author2 = Donald M. Taylor | author3 = Fathali M. Moghaddam |title = Responding to Membership in a Disadvantaged Group: From Acceptance to Collective Protest |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 58|pages = 994–1003|year = June 1990| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.994|issue = 6|ref = harv| url = http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=64044 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; legitimacy of the intergroup structures, and the stability of these relationships. For example, when disadvantaged groups perceive intergroup status relationships as illegitimate and unstable, collective action is predicted to occur, in an attempt to change status structures for the betterment of the disadvantaged group.

Meta-analysis results also confirm that social identity causally predicts collective action across a number of diverse contexts. Additionally, the integrated SIMCA affords another important role to social identity – that of a psychological bridge forming the collective base from which both collective efficacy and group injustice may be conceived.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Model refinement===
While there is sound empirical support for the causal importance of SIMCA’s key theoretical variables on collective action,&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; more recent literature has addressed the issue of reverse causation, finding support for a related, yet distinct, encapsulation model of social identity in collective action (EMSICA).&lt;ref name="Thomas, Mavor &amp; McGarty (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Thomas|first = E.F.|last2=Mavor|first2=K.I.|last3=McGarty|first3=C.|title = Social identities facilitate and encapsulate action-relevant constructs: A test of the social identity model of collective action|journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|volume = 15| issue = 1| pages = 75–88|year = 2011|doi = 10.1177/1368430211413619|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model suggests that perceived group efficacy and perceived injustice provide the basis from which social identity emerges, highlighting an alternative causal pathway to collective action. Recent research has sought to integrate SIMCA with [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact theory]] (see Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär, &amp; Heath&lt;ref name="Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär &amp; Heath (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cakal|first = H.|last2=Hewstone|first2=M.|last3=Schwär|first3=G.|last4=Heath|first4=A.|title = An investigation of the social identity model of collective action and the 'sedative' effect of intergroup contact among Black and White students in South Africa|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 50| pages = 606–627|year = 2011|doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02075.x|pmid = 22122025|issue = 4|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and others have extended SIMCA through bridging morality research with the collective action literature (see van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = van Zomeren|first = M.|last2=Postmes|first2=T.|last3=Spears|first3=R.|title = On conviction's collective consequences: Integrating moral conviction with the social identity model of collective action|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 51| pages = 52–71|year = 2012|doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02000.x|pmid = 22435846|issue = 1|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

==Public good==
The economic theory of collective action is concerned with the provision of [[public good]]s (and other collective consumption) through the [[collaboration]] of two or more individuals, and the impact of [[externality|externalities]] on group behavior. It is more commonly referred to as [[Public Choice]].  [[Mancur Olson]]'s 1965 book ''[[The Logic of Collective Action|The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups]],'' is an important early analysis of the problems of public good cost.

Besides economics, the theory has found many applications in [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[communication]], [[anthropology]] and [[environmentalism]].

===Collective action problem===
{{main|Collective action problem}}
The term collective action problem describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action, but has an associated cost making it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone. The ideal solution is then to undertake this as a collective action, the cost of which is shared. Situations like this include the [[prisoner's dilemma]], a collective action problem in which no communication is allowed, the [[free rider problem]], and the [[tragedy of the commons]], also known as the problem with open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agar|first1=Jesse|title=Tragedy of the Commons │ The Problem with Open Access|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYA1y405JW0|website=Youtube|publisher=This Place (youtube channel)|accessdate=Jun 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An allegorical metaphor often used to describe the problem is "[[belling the cat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dowding |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Dowding |year=1996 |title=Power |pages=31&amp;nbsp;''ff.'' |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn= 978-0-8166-2941-1 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Solutions to collective action problems include mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, and [[assurance contract]]s, also known as crowdacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van den Akker|first1=Ron|title=Crowdacting|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6tqZqoh8DY|website=YouTube|publisher=Bord&amp;Stift|accessdate=Sep 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of the great by the small===
[[Mancur Olson]] made the claim that individual [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] leads to situations where individuals with more resources will carry a higher burden in the provision of the public good than poorer ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Olson|first=Mancur|title=logic of collective action: Public goods and the theory of groups|year=1965|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- why exactly is this so controversial? --&gt; Poorer individuals will usually have little choice but to opt for the [[Free rider problem|free rider]] strategy, i.e., they will attempt to benefit from the public good without contributing to its provision. This may also encourage the under-production (inefficient production) of the public good.

===Institutional design===
While public goods are often provided by governments, this is not always the case.  Various institutional designs have been studied with the aim of reducing the collaborative failure.  The best design for a given situation depends on the production costs, the utility function, and the collaborative effects, amongst other things.  Here are only some examples:

====Joint products====
A joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good.  For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good).

It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).

====Clubs====
Some institutional design, e.g., [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]], can introduce an exclusion mechanism and turn a pure [[public good]] into an impure public good artificially.

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the [[collaboration]], clubs can emerge.  [[James M. Buchanan]] showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=James M.|title=An Economic Theory of Clubs|journal=Economica|year=1965|volume=32|pages=1–14|jstor=2552442|doi=10.2307/2552442|issue=125|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[nation]] can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club.

====Federated structure====
In some cases, theory shows that collaboration emerges spontaneously in smaller groups rather than in large ones (see e.g. [[Dunbar's number]]). This explains why [[trade union|labor unions]] or [[Charitable organization|charities]] often have a federated structure.

==In philosophy==
Since the late 20th century, analytic philosophers have been exploring the nature of collective action in the sense of acting together, as when people paint a house together, go for a walk together, or together execute a pass play. These particular examples have been central for three of the philosophers who have made well known contributions to this literature:  [[Michael Bratman]], [[Margaret Gilbert]], and [[John Searle]], respectively.

In {{Harv|Gilbert|1989}} and subsequent articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7) Gilbert argues for an account of collective action according to which this rests on a special kind of interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a "joint commitment". A joint commitment in Gilbert's sense is not a matter of a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says "Shall we go for a walk?" and the other says "Yes, let's". Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a joint commitment account of collective action, in Gilbert's view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In {{Harv|Gilbert|2006a}} she discusses the pertinence of joint commitment to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.

In Searle (1990) Searle argues that what lies at the heart of a collective action is the presence in the mind of each participant of a "we-intention". Searle does not give an account of we-intentions or, as he also puts it, "[[collective intentionality]]", but insists that they are distinct from the "I-intentions" that animate the actions of persons acting alone.

In Bratman (1993) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people "share an intention" to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be "common knowledge" between the participants.

Discussion in this area continues to expand, and has influenced discussions in other disciplines including anthropology, developmental psychology, and economics. One general question is whether it is necessary to think in terms that go beyond the personal intentions of individual human beings properly to characterize what it is to act together. Bratman's account does not go beyond such personal intentions. Gilbert's account, with its invocation of joint commitment, does go beyond them. Searle's account does also, with its invocation of [[collective intentionality]]. The question of whether and how one must account for the existence of mutual obligations when there is a collective intention is another of the issues in this area of inquiry.

==Spontaneous consensus==

In addition to the psychological mechanisms of collective action as explained by the [[Collective action#The social identity model|social identity model]], researchers have developed sociological models of why collective action exists and have studied under what conditions collective action emerges.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baronchelli |first=Andrea |arxiv=1704.07767|title=The Emergence of Consensus |journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=172189 |date=2017 |bibcode=2018RSOS....572189B |doi=10.1098/rsos.172189 |pmid=29515905 |pmc=5830794 |year=1721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along this social dimension, a special case of the general collective action problem is one of collective agreement: how does a group of agents (humans, animals, robots, etc.) reach consensus about a decision or belief in the absence of central organization? Common examples can be found from domains as diverse as biology ([[flocking (behavior)|flocking]], [[shoaling and schooling]], and general [[collective animal behavior]]), economics ([[Herd behavior#Stock market bubbles|stock market bubbles]]), and sociology ([[Convention (norm)#Social|social conventions]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]]) among others.

Consensus is distinct from the [[Collective action#Collective action problem|collective action problem]] in that there often is not an explicit goal, benefit, or cost of action but rather it concerns itself with a [[social equilibrium]] of the individuals involved (and their beliefs). And it can be considered '''''spontaneous''''' when it emerges without the presence of a centralized [[institution]] among self-interested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sugden |first1=Robert |date=1989 |title=Spontaneous order |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=85–97 |doi=10.1257/jep.3.4.85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===

Spontaneous consensus can be considered along 4 dimensions involving the social structure of the individuals participating (local versus global) in the consensus as well as the processes (competitive vs cooperative) involved in reaching consensus:&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt;

* Competitive
* Cooperative
* Local
* Global

====Competitive versus cooperative====

The underlying processes of spontaneous consensus can be viewed either as ''cooperation'' among individuals trying to coordinate themselves through their interactions or as ''competition'' between the alternatives or choices to be decided upon.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; Depending on the dynamics of the individuals involved as well as the context of the alternatives considered for consensus, the process can be wholly cooperative, wholly competitive, or a mix of the two.

====Local versus global====

The distinction between local and global consensus can be viewed in terms of the social structure underlying the network of individuals participating in the consensus making process. ''Local consensus'' occurs when there is agreement between groups of neighboring nodes while ''global consensus'' refers to the state in which most of the population has reached an agreement.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; How and why consensus is reached is dependent on both the structure of the social network of individuals as well as the presence (or lack) of centralized [[institutions]].

===Equilibrium mechanisms===

There are many mechanisms (social and psychological) that have been identified to underlie the consensus making process.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; They have been used to both explain the emergence of spontaneous consensus and understand how to facilitate an equilibrium between individuals and can be grouped according to their role in the process.

===Methods and techniques===

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of both the mechanisms as well as the applications of spontaneous consensus, a variety of techniques have been developed to study the emergence and evolution of spontaneous cooperation. Two of the most widely used are [[game theory]] and [[social network analysis]].

====Game theory====

Traditionally [[game theory]] has been used to study [[zero-sum games]] but has been extended to many [[Game Theory#game types|different types of games]]. Relevant to the study of spontaneous consensus are [[Cooperative game theory|cooperative]] and [[non-cooperative game theory|non-cooperative]] games. Since a consensus must be reached without the presence of any external authoritative institution for it to be considered ''spontaneous'', non-cooperative games and [[nash equilibrium]] have been the dominant paradigm for which to study its emergence.

In the context of non-cooperative games, a consensus is a formal [[nash equilibrium]] that all players tend towards through [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] alliances or agreements.

====Social network analysis====

An alternative approach to studying the emergence of spontaneous consensus—that avoids many of the unnatural or overly constrained assumptions of game theoretic models—is the use of network based methods and social network analysis (SNA). These SNA models are theoretically grounded in the communication mechanism&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of facilitating consensus and describe its emergence through the information propagation processes of the network ([[behavioral contagion]]). Through the spread of influence (and ideas) between agents participating in the consensus, local and global consensus can emerge if the agents in the network achieve a shared equilibrium state. Leveraging this model of consensus, researchers have shown that local peer influence can be used to reach a global consensus and cooperation across the entire network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mani |first1=Ankur |last2=Rahwan |first2=Iyad |last3=Pentland |first3=Alex |date=2013 |title=Inducing Peer Pressure to Promote Cooperation |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01735 |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |issue=1735 |pages=1735 |doi=10.1038/srep01735 |pmid=23619166 |pmc=3636514 |bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1735M }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this model of consensus and cooperation has been shown to be successful in certain contexts, research suggest that communication and social influence cannot be fully captured by simple contagion models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alshamsi |first1=Aamena |last2=Pianesi |first2=Fabio |last3=Lepri |first3=Bruno |last4=Pentland |first4=Alex |last5=Rahwan |first5=Iyad |date=2015 |title=Beyond Contagion: Reality Mining Reveals Complex Patterns of Social Influence |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=8 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135740 |pmid=26313449 |pmc=4551670 |page=e0135740|arxiv=1507.04192 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1035740A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such a pure contagion based model of consensus may have limits.

{{About|the discipline|the journal|Communication Theory (journal)}}
'''Communication theory''' is a field of [[information theory]] and [[mathematics]] that studies the technical process of information&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |date=2011 |origyear=July and October 1948 |publisher=The Bell System Technical Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=55 |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life |last=Dainton |first=Marianne |authorlink= |author2=Elain D. Zellei |year=2011 |publisher= Sage Publications |location= |isbn=1-4129-7691-X |page= |pages=247 |url= http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4983_Dainton_Chapter_1.pdf |accessdate= November 4, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally communication theory is “any systematic summary about the nature of the communication process” (Dainton, 2019). It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, ''Communication Theory as a Field'' (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”

"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)

== Elements of communication ==

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

{{Refimprove|date=June 2017}}}}
'''Customer value maximization''' ('''CVM''') is a real-time service model that, proponents say, goes beyond basic [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) capabilities, identifying and capturing maximum potential from prospects and existing customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799019107|title=Superior customer value/ Buch.|date=2012|publisher=CRC|isbn=9781439861288|oclc=799019107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that a well-devised CVM program helps companies offer the right things to the right people at the right time. The CVM framework uses creative, technology, media and process along with robust measurement systems to help marketers maximize returns from their marketing investments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Customer-centricity ==

* Customer interactions with brands have become more layered/complex due to electronic channels of communication – Digital, Mobile, and Social-Internet.
* Hyper competition and multiplicity of messages have severely impaired customer attention
* Analytics and technology can be applied to address consumer behavior challenges
* Marketing is forced to demonstrate accountability
* Lack of human interaction with customers leads to inability to "close the sale"

These factors have made it imperative for marketing organizations to find new mechanisms to generate value from each customer interaction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Customer value maximization shifts focus from managing products or marketing campaigns to managing the profitability of individual customers over the life of the relationship. While CVM may lead to better product offerings and more targeted campaigns, a customer value manager asks different questions compared to a traditional [[marketing manager]].
Instead of asking who will respond to a 10% off promotion, a customer value manager strives to understand who the customer is and what they can offer to increase the customer's lifetime value?

The CVM framework evaluates current methods and effectiveness, makes changes where required, and sets up a measurement system that helps in evaluating effectiveness. The CVM framework operates as a continuous process in a closed loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300310255|title=Superior customer value in the new economy concepts and cases|last=Art.|first=Weinstein,|last2=Art.|first2=Weinstein,|date=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0203501497|oclc=300310255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing scenario ==

Today customers own the on and off switches to all media/mediums, are more knowledgeable about various products and services they are being marketed to and have very limited attention spans owing to existing clutter. The remote, so to speak, is now unmistakably in the customers' hands. Most marketers have realized that traditional methods of marketing simply don’t work in this new milieu. They are today actively seeking, investing and mastering newer methods and tools that go beyond making their brands merely visible to ones that allow better consumer understanding, precise targeting, customized offering and above all that which engage and let them have a two-way conversation with their customers. For the progressive marketer, the real challenge begins from this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/64996/financial-marketing-trends-technology-media-cmo/|title=Financial Marketers Not Ready For The Future|date=2017-04-24|work=The Financial Brand|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing challenges ==

Marketing challenges can be predominantly dissected into 4 categories:

* '''Lifecycle challenges''' include driving usage of a product/service, new client acquisition, enabling cross-sell, up-sell, client retention, activation, usage, preventing [[Churn rate|churn]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1965/11/exploit-the-product-life-cycle|title=Exploit the Product Life Cycle|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Segment-based challenges''' Companies have the need to reach out to each customer in a different way suiting their needs and this is all the more the case when the company has multiple products/product variants. They need to reach out in a focused manner to independent segments that require varying strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/b2b-segmentation-research/|title=Market Segmentation in B2B Markets {{!}} B2B Segmentation|work=B2B International|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel-based challenges''' Most companies adopt a multi-channel strategy in order to take their products or services to their customers. Each channel- be it a store, online, mobile etc. needs to be tackled in a different way to ensure maximization of results. In addition to this channel, cannibalization should also not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33820/5-major-challenges-marketers-face-and-how-to-solve-them.aspx#sm.000o4u5vs14d1d24qtf12erw39363|title=7 of the Top Marketing Challenges Marketers Face Today [New Data]|last=Kolowich|first=Lindsay|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Function-based challenges''' When companies invest in marketing programs they look for methods that help them evaluate and track how it works and to measure [[Return on investment|ROI]]. Systems to manage their programs, maximize results and optimize spends are all that companies keep looking for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/7-big-problems-marketing.aspx|title=7 Big Problems in the Marketing Industry|website=www.ama.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What organizations need from their marketing programs ==

The intended outcome of marketing investments may be

* [[Customer acquisition management|Drive acquisition]]
* Influence [[Conversion rate|conversion]]
* Produce revenues – directly or indirectly
* [[Cross-selling|Cross-sell]], [[Upselling|Up-sell]]
* Reduce [[Churn rate|Churn]]

The actual outcomes, however, happen to be

* Traffic to website
* Conversations on social media
* Views of online videos
* Calls to 1800 numbers
* Walk-ins to physical outlets

== Benefits ==

* Takes customer view of all marketing programs and integrates them to deliver value.
* Brings [[Marketing accountability|accountability]] to marketing programs.
* Helps map marketing goals to business goals.
* Helps identify the right marketing channel and tool mix.
* Small interventions in marketing programs to create significant change.

== Features ==

* X-ray marketing programs.
* Evaluate their effectiveness.
* Re-architect them according to goals.
* Augment Measurement System.
* Grow value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey%20offices/spain/pdfs/driving_intelligent_growth.ashx|title=Driving Intelligent Growth with Customer Value Maximization|last=Anna|first=Fiorentino|date=December 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== When this becomes critical ==

* Whenever the marketing team needs to demonstrate the accountability of spends or measurability of returns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Increase yield from current customer-facing programs, channels or product lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Align and optimize [[customer engagement]] on [[digital media|digital]], 1-1 and [[social media]] to overarching brand and business objectives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Versus CRM ==

[[Customer relationship management]] facilitates deepening of relationships with existing customers using database marketing techniques. Customer value maximization, on the other hand, is used to maximize value for both existing and prospective customers and follows a multi-disciplinary approach. Customer value maximization may or may not require [[relationship marketing]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

{{confuse|Deck (ship)}}
[[File:Parts of a truss bridge.svg|right|thumb|300px|The various parts of a truss bridge]] 

A '''deck''' is the surface of a [[bridge]].  A structural element of its [[Superstructure#bridge|superstructure]], it may be constructed of [[concrete]], [[steel]], [[grating|open grating]], or wood. Sometimes the deck is covered a [[track ballast|railroad bed]] and [[railroad track|track]], [[asphalt concrete]], or other form of [[pavement (material)|pavement]] for ease of vehicle crossing. A concrete deck may be an integral part of the bridge structure ([[T-beam]] or [[double tee]] structure) or it may be supported with [[I-beam]]s or steel [[girder]]s.

When a bridge deck is installed in a [[through truss]], it is sometimes called a floor system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A3oSAAAAYAAJ Members of a Truss Bridge], by Benj. F. La Rue, Home Study Magazine, Published by the Colliery Engineer Company, Vol 3, No. 2, March 1898, pages 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''suspended bridge deck''' will be suspended from the main structural elements on a suspension or arch bridge. On some bridges, such as a [[Tied-arch bridge|tied-arch]] or a [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]], the deck is a primary [[structural element]], carrying tension or compression to support the span.

==Structural analysis==
[[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] have several principal categories of bridge decks, for the purposes of analytic techniques. A ''beam deck'' is one where the deck and any supporting structure act together as a single beam. A ''grid deck'' uses [[Beam (structure)|beams]] and [[Diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]] as the supporting structure. The supporting system of a grid deck is analyzed using a grillage analysis. A ''slab deck'' is one where the deck is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the deck is known and analyzed as an [[orthotropic deck]]. A ''beam and slab deck'' is one where the beams may [[Deflection (engineering)|deflect]] somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the deck. A ''cellular deck'' is one where a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the deck. A ''boxgirder deck'' is one where the deck forms the top of the [[box girder]] during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hambly| first =E.

==Railway bridge decks==
[[File:Columbus and Greenville Railway bridge over Yazoo River.jpg|thumb|upright|An open-deck railway bridge in [[Leflore County, Mississippi]]]]

A [[railway bridge]] with its [[Track (rail transport)|track]] and [[Railroad tie|ties]] supported on load carrying elements of the superstructure (floor [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, [[stringer (stairs)|stringer]]s or [[girder]]s) is called an ''open deck''. When the track rests upon [[Track ballast|ballast]], which is then carried by the superstructure of the bridge, it is called a ''ballasted deck''. The term ''direct fixation'' is used when the rails are anchored directly to the superstructure of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorgenfrei| first1=Donald F.| last2=Marianos| first2=W.N.| date=Nov 4, 1999|chapter=Railroad Bridges| editor1-last=Chen| editor1-first=Wai-Fah| editor2-last=Lian| editor2-first=Duan| title=Bridge Engineering Handbook| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxYKgLVnT8YC|publisher=[[CRC Press]]| pages=23–5| isbn=0-8493-7434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DeepCwind Consortium''' is a national consortium of universities, nonprofits, utilities, and industry leaders. The mission of the consortium is to establish the State of Maine as a national leader in [[Floating wind turbine|floating offshore wind technology]]. Much of the consortium's work and resulting research has been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundations, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DeepCwind Consortium|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/offshore-wind/deepcwind-consortium/|website=UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of the DeepCwind Consortium culminated in the [[University of Maine]] patent-pending [[VolturnUS (floating wind turbine)|VolturnUS]], a floating concrete hull technology can support wind turbines in water depths of 45 meters or more, and has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of offshore wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New England Aqua Ventus I Selected by the DOE for up to $39.9 Million in Additional Funding|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|website=UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|accessdate=5 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719035555/http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|archivedate=19 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The DeepCwind Consortium was initially funded in 2009 as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) through the U.S. Department of Energy. The University of Maine received $7.1 million to found the consortium and design and deploy floating offshore turbine prototypes. As part of this funding, the research plan included: "optimization of designs for floating platforms by evaluating options for using more durable, lighter, hybrid composite materials, manufacturability, and deployment logistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of Energy Recovery Act State Memos: Maine|date=1 June 2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|pages=5|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/edg/recovery/documents/Recovery_Act_Memo_Maine.pdf |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floating deepwater wind farms placed ten or more nautical miles (nmi) offshore can play a critical role in reaching the Department of Energy’s 20% windpower goal by 2030. Deepwater offshore wind is the dominant U.S. ocean energy resource, representing a potential of nearly 3,100 TW-h/year. It also:
* Overcomes viewshed issues that have delayed or prevented some nearshore projects.
* Places energy generation closer to major U.S. population centers.
* Allows access to a more powerful Class 6 and 7 wind resource.
* Reduces over time wind energy costs by reducing transmission costs from remote land sites and by simplifying deployment and maintenance logistics.

With these qualities in mind, Maine plans to construct a 5 GW, $20 billion network of floating offshore wind farms to contribute to the northeast U.S. renewable energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Habib|title=Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Report|date=September 2012|publisher=University of Maine|location=Orono, ME|pages=567|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/files/2015/05/OfficialOffshoreWindReport-22311.pdf |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maine has the deepest waters near its shores, approximately 200&amp;nbsp;ft deep at 3 nmi, and 89% of Maine’s 156 GW offshore wind resource is in deep waters. The state also offers extensive maritime industry infrastructure and proximity to one of the largest energy markets in the country.

== Research Outcomes ==

The DeepCwind Consortium published the Maine Offshore Wind Report in February 2011. The report "examines economics and policy, electrical grid integration, wind and wave, bathymetric, soil, and environmental research.  It also includes summaries of assembly and construction sites, critical issues for project development and permitting, and an analysis of the implications of the Jones Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offshore Wind Report|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/offshore-wind/offshore-wind-report/|website=UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the consortium deployed the 20 kW&lt;ref name=4c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/deepcwind-consortium---volturnus---dyces-head-test-site-united-states-us31.html |title=DeepCwind Consortium - VolturnUS - Dyces Head Test Site |publisher=4C Offshore|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[VolturnUS (floating wind turbine)|VolturnUS 1:8]], a 65-foot-tall [[Floating wind turbine#VolturnUS|floating turbine prototype]] that is 1:8th the scale of a 6-megawatt (MW), 450-foot rotor diameter design. VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine in the Americas.

In June 2016, the UMaine-led New England Aqua Ventus I project has just won top tier status from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technology Demonstration Program for Offshore Wind. New England Aqua Ventus I is a two 6 MW turbine (12 MW) floating offshore wind pilot project 14 miles off Maine’s coast, developed by Maine Aqua Ventus, GP, LLC.  The objective of the pilot is to demonstrate the technology at full scale, allowing floating farms to be built out-of-sight across the US and the world in the 2020s, bringing lower-cost, clean renewable energy to coastal population centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New England Aqua Ventus I Selected by the DOE for up to $39.9 Million in Additional Funding|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|website=UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=5 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719035555/http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|archivedate=19 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnering Organizations and Original Research Initiatives ==

The University of Maine-led consortium includes universities, nonprofits, and utilities; a wide range of industry leaders in offshore design, offshore construction, and marine structures manufacturing; firms with expertise in wind project siting, environmental analysis, environmental law, composites materials to assist in corrosion-resistant material design and selection, and energy investment; and industry organizations to assist with education and tech transfer activities.

=== Task 1: Micrositing, Geophysical Investigations, and Geotechnical Engineering ===
The primary objective of micrositing, geophysical investigations, and geotechnical engineering was the characterization of the seafloor environment for turbine anchoring at the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site in the Gulf of Maine. Activities coordinated geologic and geotechnical engineering information with the metocean forces assessed in the Offshore Turbine Testing, Monitoring, and Reliability task and assisted in design of efficient moorings and anchors for the floating offshore wind turbines under the Floating Turbines Design and Lab Testing task. An additional objective of this task was to provide site location documentation and address safety and navigation at the site once the turbines and moorings are installed.

Partners: University of Maine Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, James W. Sewall Company, Maine Maritime Academy, University of Western Australia Centre for Offshore Foundation Research

=== Task 2: Study of Environmental/Ecological Impacts ===
Maine Public Law 270, which allowed the establishment of the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, required that the following state and federal agencies be consulted concerning environmental monitoring and planning of the test site:
* Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
* Department of Marine Resources
* Department of Conservation
* Coast Guard
* Army Corps of Engineers
* NOAA Fisheries

These agencies required plans for siting, navigation, project removal, remedial action, and environmental/ecological monitoring. They also required reports and updates on site activities.
* Micrositing and geophysical investigations activities
* Bathymetric surveys
* Survey to check for presence of historically significant resources
* Site plan creation
* Navigation and safety plan creation
* Environmental/ecological monitoring activities

There were to be wildlife-specific studies for:
* Benthic Invertebrates
* Fish
* Marine mammals
* Birds and bats
* No live animals will be collected for the environmental monitoring efforts.

As part of the environmental/ecological monitoring plan that was part of the test site permit application, a review of the potential threats to marine life was considered and mitigation measures were designed. Potential areas of concern addressed in this report included the following:

* Entanglement of marine mammals in mooring lines and structures.
* Disturbance of migration and feeding areas.
* Bird and bat strikes.
* Attraction of fish or marine mammals to the platforms.
* Interruption of wave energy direction and focus.
* Human impacts.
* Visual impacts.
* Potential disturbance of historical or culturally significant areas.

All micrositing, environmental/ecological monitoring, and permitting activities were conducted from the start of the project in 2010 until the end of the project in 2012.

Partners: University of Maine School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine School of Biology and Ecology, Island Institute, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, New Jersey Audubon Society, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

=== Task 3: Permitting and Policy ===
Under the recently enacted Maine Public Law 2009, Chapter 270 (LD 1465), the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site is located near Monhegan Island, an area selected by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Kevin|title=Baldacci signs bill for ocean energy|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2009/06/04/politics/baldacci-signs-bill-for-ocean-energy/|accessdate=5 July 2016|agency=Bangor Daily News|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site was analyzed in detail through the state’s site selection process.

With Maine’s designation of the test site, the Permitting and Policy team secured specific permits for the proposed project from all applicable local, state, and federal permitting authorities. In conformance with the application requirements, to obtain a General Permit under LD 1465, the Permitting and Policy team, in conjunction with the Micrositing and Ecological Monitoring teams, submitted a report to the required state and federal agencies describing:
* Existing commercial fishing and other uses in the project area, as well as the marine resources.
* A detailed monitoring plan of benthic invertebrates, fish, marine mammal, and avian wildlife.
* Monitoring plan of ambient noise levels possibly associated with project construction and, if needed, any subsequent operations and avoidance and mitigation measures.
* Navigation public safety plans.
* Project removal plan.

The team worked to develop these plans in consultation with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as stakeholders.

Partners: James W. Sewall Company, Kleinschmidt, HDR/DTA

===  Task 4: Floating Turbine Design, Material Selection, and Lab Testing ===

The primary objectives of the Floating Turbine Design task was to:
* Partially validate the coupled aeroelastic/hydrodynamic models developed by NREL.
* Optimize platform designs by integrating more durable, lighter, hybrid composite materials.
* Develop a complete design of one or more scale floating turbine platforms, capable of supporting a wind turbine in the 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 250&amp;nbsp;kW range for deployment at the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site.

Partners: Advanced Structures and Composites Center, Maine Maritime Academy, Technip USA, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Sandia National Labs, Ashland, Inc., Kenway Corporation, Harbor Technologies, PPG Industries, Owens Corning, Zoltek, Polystrand, Inc.

=== Task 5: Offshore Turbine Testing, Monitoring, and Reliability ===
The Physical Oceanography Group (PhOG) at the University of Maine deployed and operated an oceanographic data buoy with real-time telemetry capabilities in the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site offshore Monhegan Island. The ocean data buoy was deployed prior to the tank testing and remained in operation throughout the project period in order to monitor oceanographic, meteorological, and general environmental conditions. Monitoring emphasis was on wind speed and direction, visibility, directional waves, and water-column currents.

Partners: University of Maine Physical Oceanography Group, University of Maine School of Marine Sciences

=== Task 6: Education and Outreach ===
The University of Maine, Maine Maritime Academy, and Northern Maine Community College developed several degree programs to create a trained workforce for the State of Maine. To ensure the community at large understands our research and development, the DeepCwind Consortium found numerous opportunities to share and discuss goals, activity plans, and the results of research. The consortium held public meetings to discuss the site selection for the University of Maine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, presented at conferences within the state and across the country, and even taught an interactive wind-wave tank testing activity to over 500 K-12 students across Maine. These and other activities continued through the duration of the project.

Partners: Advanced Structures and Composites Center, University of Maine College of Engineering, 
University of Maine Department of Industrial Cooperation, Maine Maritime Academy, Northern Maine Community College, American Composites Manufacturers Association, Maine Composites Alliance, Maine Wind Industry Initiative

Task 8: Fabrication and Deployment
UMaine and its subcontractors led the fabrication and deployment of the approximately 1/8 scale floating wind turbine platform. The deployment study sought to identify key deployment and installation factors. The performance data gathered from the 1/8 scale platform was used to further validate platform numerical models developed by NREL and others.

'''Design theory''' is a subfield of [[design research]] concerned with various theoretical approaches towards understanding and delineating design principles, design knowledge, and design practice.

== History ==

Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the [[philosophy of design]] to a search for a [[design science]].

The essay "Ornament and Crime" by [[Adolf Loos]] from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's ''Vers une architecture'',&lt;ref name="Corbusier 1923"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture" (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Papanek]]'s ''Design for the real world'' (1972).

In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the [[De Stijl]] movement promoted a geometrical abstract, "ascetic" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the [[Bauhaus]] movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.

For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/cephad-centre-philosophy-design/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

An example of early design science was Altshuller's ''Theory of inventive problem solving'', known as [[TRIZ]], from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 ''The sciences of the artificial'' began a more scientific basis to the study of design. &lt;ref name="simon1996"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon|title='The Sciences of the Artificial|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=0-262-69191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the further development of fields such as [[design methods]], [[design research]], [[design science]] and [[design thinking]] has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

'''The Documentation Centre for Music''' (DOMUS), at the [[Stellenbosch University Music Library]], has its origins in the work and interests of staff and students at the Department of Music at [[Stellenbosch University]].  These include, at various times, academic staff members and Music library staff.  The existence of this Centre on a more formal basis is due to the efforts of [[Prof. Stephanus Muller]], and funding provided by the Stellenbosch University Music Department and the Vice-rector Research at Stellenbosch University.  In August 2005 an [[archivist]] Santie de Jong was appointed to sort and maintain the archive's various collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Jong|first=Santie|year=2015|title=Armed with a light bulb at the end of a chord: The ten-year journey of DOMUS|url=|journal=Fontes Artis Musicae|volume=62:3|pages=212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aims of DOMUS'''
&lt;br /&gt;
DOMUS aims to collect, conserve/preserve, sort, and catalogue, for the benefit of research on [[postgraduate]] level, the literary estates of [[composer]]s, [[performer]]s and [[musicologist]]s, as well as documentation collections of music institutions. Moreover, DOMUS aims to produce "strategic projects" such as recordings, publications and exhibitions "to maintain the expressive cultures represented in these collections as an important part of a broad South African heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domus.ac.za/content/view/13/27/|title=www.domus.ac.za {{!}} Vision {{!}} Music, South, Collections, Africa, Research|last=Administrator|website=www.domus.ac.za|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43429">An '''eco-city''' is a city built from the principles of living within environment means. The ultimate goal of many eco-cities is to eliminate all carbon waste ([[zero-carbon city]]), to produce energy entirely through [[renewable resource]]s, and to merge the city harmoniously with the natural environment; however, eco-cities also have the intentions of stimulating [[economic growth]], reducing poverty, using higher [[population densities]], and therefore obtaining higher efficiency, and improving health.

==History==

===Origins===

The concept of the “Emils Gejs” was born out of one of the first organizations focused on eco-city development, “[[Urban Emiils]].” The group was founded by Richard Register in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1975,&lt;ref name="Urban Ecology"&gt;{{cite web|title=BallsEcology|url=http://www.urbanecology.org/history.htm|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was founded with the idea of reconstructing cities to be in balance with nature.&lt;ref name="Dimensions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseland|first=Mark|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222495799_Dimensions_of_the_eco-city|title=Dimensions of the Eco-city|journal=Cities|year=1997|volume=14|issue=4|pages=197–202|accessdate=21 November 2011|doi=10.1016/s0264-2751(97)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They worked to plant trees along the main streets, built [[solar greenhouse]]s, and worked within the Berkeley legal system to pass [[environmentally friendly]] policies and encourage public transportation. Urban Ecology then took the movement another step further with the creation of The Urban Ecologist, a journal they started publishing in 1987.

===International Eco-City Conference===

[[Urban ecology]] further advanced the movement when they hosted the first International Eco-City Conference in Berkeley, California in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devuyst|first=Dimitri|title=How green is the city?|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference focused on urban sustainability problems and encouraged the over 700 participants to submit proposals on how to best reform cities to work within environmental means. In 1992 Richard Register founded the organization [[Ecocity Builders]] which has acted as convener of the conference series ever since. 
Eco-City Conferences have been held in Adelaide, Australia; Yoff, Senegal; Curitiba, Brazil; Shenzhen, China; Bangalore, India; San Francisco, United States; Istanbul, Turkey; Montreal, Canada; Nantes, France and Abu Dhabi (2015).&lt;ref name="Ecocity Builders"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecocity Builders|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Conference on: Green Urbanism will be held in Italy from 12–14 October 2016 will discuss Eco-cities and Different other Topics.

Also, the conference Ice Cool Earth (ICEF), first held in Tokyo, Japan in 2014, and now every year at the same place, aims to discuss the future of economics and discuss the possibility for Eco-cities and smart-design from an energy &amp; economic perspective. The conference gather important political leaders (Prime Minister of Japan did an apparition), leading enterprise from Europe and Asia, and few academics and also have an active forum.&lt;ref name="ICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icef-forum.org/)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco-city criteria==
Several sets of criteria for Eco-cities have been suggested, encompassing the economic, social, and environmental qualities that an eco-city should satisfy. The ideal "eco-city" has been described as a city that fulfils the following requirements:&lt;ref name="Dimensions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|title=Green vision: the search for the ideal eco-city|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c13677ce-b062-11df-8c04-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1eCqQTdQm|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Awesome Green Roof.jpg|thumb|An example of a green roof project]]

* Operates on a [[self-contained]] economy, resources needed are found locally
* Has completely carbon-neutral and [[renewable energy]] production
* Has a well-planned city layout and [[public transportation]] system that makes the priority methods of transportation as follows possible: [[walkability|walking]] first, then [[Bicycle-friendly|cycling]], and then public transportation.
* Resource conservation—maximizing [[resource efficiency|efficiency]] of water and energy resources, constructing a [[waste management]] system that can [[recycle]] waste and reuse it, creating a [[zero-waste]] system
* [[environmental restoration|Restores]] [[environmental damage|environmentally damaged]] urban areas
* Ensures decent and affordable housing for all socio-economic and ethnic groups and improve jobs opportunities for disadvantaged groups, such as women, minorities, and the disabled
* Supports [[Local food|local agriculture and produce]]
* Promotes voluntary simplicity in lifestyle choices, decreasing [[resource efficiency|material consumption]], and increasing [[environmentalism|awareness of environmental]] and sustainability issues

In addition to these initial requirements, the city design must be able to grow and evolve as the population grows and the needs of the population change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graedel|first=Thomas|title=Industrial Ecology and the Ecocity|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/UrbanizationEngineering/IndustrialEcologyandtheEcocity.aspx|publisher=National Academy of Engineering|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially important when taking into consideration infrastructure designs, such as for water systems, power lines, etc. These must be built in such a way that they are easy to modernize (as opposed to the dominant current strategy of placing them underground, and therefore making them highly inaccessible).

Each individual eco-city development has also set its own requirements to ensure their city is environmentally sustainable; these criteria range from zero-waste and [[zero-carbon]] emissions, such as in the [[Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city]] project and the Abu Dhabi [[Masdar City]] project, to simple urban revitalization and [[green roof]] garden projects in [[Augustenborg, Malmö|Augustenborg]], [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Caprotti, F. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275113001327 'Critical research on eco-cities? A walk through the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City]'.

Using a different set of criteria, the International Eco-Cities Initiative recently identified as many as 178 significant eco-city initiatives at different stages of planning and implementation around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Joss, S., Tomozeiu, D. and Cowley, R., 2011. "Eco-Cities - a global survey: eco-city profiles", University of Westminster ({{ISBN|978-0-9570527-1-0}}). Available from: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/ecocities/publications&lt;/ref&gt; To be included in this census, initiatives needed to be at least district-wide in their scale, to cover a variety of sectors, and to have official policy status. Although such schemes display great variety in their ambitions, scale, and conceptual underpinnings, since the late 2000s there has been an international proliferation of frameworks of urban sustainability indicators and processes designed to be implemented across different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Joss, S., Cowley, R., de Jong, M., Müller, B., Park, B-S., Rees, W., Roseland, M., and Rydin, Y. (2015). Tomorrow’s City Today: Prospects for Standardising Sustainable Urban Development. London: University of Westminster. ({{ISBN|978-0-9570527-5-8}}) Available from: http://www.westminster.ac.uk/ecocities-leverhulme&lt;/ref&gt; This may suggest that a process of de facto eco-city 'standardisation' is underway.

==Practical achievements==

===Economic impact===
One of the major and most noticeable economic impacts of the movement towards becoming an eco-city is the notable increase in productivity across existing industries as well as the introduction of new industries, thus creating jobs.

First, the movement away from carbon-producing energy sources to more [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind, water and solar power, provides local economies with new, thriving industries.  The creation of these industries, in turn, births an increase in the demand for labor; thus, not only does total employment increase, but an increase in wages also mimics increasing employment.&lt;ref name="International Economics" /&gt;

Moreover, one of the main priorities of a sustainable city is to reduce its [[ecological footprint]] by reducing total [[carbon emissions]], which, economically speaking means increasing productivity.  Merely increasing the rate of productivity in an industry reduces costs, both monetary and environmental; that is, as an industry becomes more productive, it can more efficiently allocate and use both its physical and [[human capital]], reducing the time it takes to make the same amount of goods which also allows for a higher wage (because employees are doing more) and a lesser environmental impact (because using less energy and resources to produce the same amount).&lt;ref name="International Economics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=James|title=International Economics|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-510015-8|pages=167–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, although the initial movement towards becoming a sustainable city may be quite costly for a smaller, poorer city, the benefits of such movement are plentiful in the long-run economic model.  Moreover, as more and more countries move towards becoming more sustainable, the technologies required to initiate this movement will become more readily accessible and cheaper; therefore, many rich, developed nations should put themselves forth as an example of what other cities should model themselves like, thus sparking the innovation towards a future of [[sustainable technology]].

===Environmental standards===
Although local environmental standards may differ across eco-cities, each city nonetheless has its own appropriate and practical goals and expectations that have provided the foundation for their recognition as a sustainable city. Differences in these goals and expectations are to be expected, however, due to the limitations of technology and local financing.

The primary goal for all sustainable cities is to significantly decrease total [[carbon emissions]] as quickly as possible in order to work towards becoming a carbon-free city; that is, sustainable cities work to move towards an economy based solely on renewable energy.  Actions towards carbon-reductions can be seen on both the corporate and individual levels: many industries are working towards cleaner production, but individuals are also moving away from environmentally costly forms of transportation to more sustainable methods, such as [[public transportation]] or biking.  On this note, another common environmental goal is to increase and make more efficient the public transportation systems.

Many sustainable cities also work towards becoming more densely populated ([[urban density]]); having its citizens living closer to energy production means less environmental costs of transporting said energy to citizen households.  Additionally, citizens living closer to the city-center also mean that transportation to work is significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-Cities|url=http://www.goodplanet.info/eng/Society/Eco-cities/Eco-cities/%28theme%29/294|publisher=Good Planet|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a city’s primary goal is to increase [[environmental education]] in hopes of achieving better citizen involvement and cooperation.  By making the private sector more aware of how its behavior affects the environment, a reduction in carbon emissions becomes more of a reality.

In terms of international standards, however, we can look to the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC).  The IFC has a long history of implementing environmental and social standards in localized economies, and its primary mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] across the globe, primarily in developing countries.  One of its plans to accomplish this goal is to encourage international cooperation in order to accelerate and promote sustainable growth across nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Finance Corporation's Policy on Social and Environmental Policy|url=http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/EnvSocStandards|publisher=International Finance Corporation|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the most important aspect of setting an environmental goal is making it plausible.  Many cities across the globe set goals that, although they may be super-sustainable, are not entirely possible.  These exaggerated goals include too much sustainable development for a small time period or an expectation that is simply too expensive.  The globe needs to work together to make steps towards a sustainable future that are possible and execute them well, ultimately resulting in an overall spiral towards complete global sustainability.

===Social===

====Poverty reduction====
The development of eco-cities has aided in reducing poverty in various locations via job creation in environmentally friendly business sectors. By promoting social equity based on meeting the needs of local populations, eco-cities create sustainable business models that encourage local investment and the subsequent expansion of the job market. [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] serves as a prime example of the manner in which adopting eco-city standards can aid in reducing urban poverty. According to the [[United Nations Environment Program]], the “EcoCity [program] has mobilized the disadvantaged and unemployed people of Ivory Park (part of the city of Johannesburg) to form co-operatives to grow and buy food, to recycle, to repair bicycles, to build homes, to use and promote green energy solutions, to become eco-tourism guides and more than 300 jobs have been created” between 1991 and 2001.&lt;ref name="Eco-City, Johannesburg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-City, Johannesburg|url=http://www.unep.org/training/programmes/Instructor%20Version/Part_2/Activities/Lifestyle_Patterns/Consumption/Strategies/Eco_City.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Program|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating small local businesses, residents of eco-cities create self-sufficient small enterprises that, as an aggregate, greatly alleviate the scarcity of quality employment and create economic opportunities that continuously aid in poverty reduction. These ecologically sound small-scale practices are additionally less sensitive to economic shocks, allowing for enduring economic sustainability in eco-cities. In addition to creating [[green jobs]], eco-cities promote the deployment of green methods of saving money, such as investing in ecologically sustainable local infrastructure, carpooling, and reducing consumption of water and energy, to decrease the financial burden on the poor.&lt;ref name="Article 13: South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSR Best Practices- Eco-City: Johannesburg, South Africa|url=http://www.article13.com/A13_ContentList.asp?strAction=GetPublication&amp;PNID=1120|publisher=Article 13|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Population distribution====
Increasing proportions of the world population are now located in cities. As a result, eco-city models place substantial attention on mitigating and reducing the environmental damage caused by growing urban populations.&lt;ref name="World Bank Eco2 Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco2 Cities|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANDEVELOPMENT/Resources/336387-1270074782769/Eco2Cities_synopsis.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because urbanization does not appear to be slowing, eco-cities aim to increase [[urban density]] while integrating “[[green infrastructure]]” or "green spaces" into the urban landscape. Eco-cities promote compact use of land by people for residential and commercial purposes. In this way, increasing urban density reduces the strain on the environment by centralizing and, thereby, reducing [[resource consumption]]. For example, the 2006 plans for the Chinese eco-city of [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] employed this strategy.&lt;ref name="Dongtan article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=Fred|title=Eco-cities Special: A Shanghai Surprise|url=http://blog.tcrouzet.com/images_tc/ecocity_ns.pdf|publisher=New Scientist Tech|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the city planned to divide its residential and commercial land into three compact districts divided by farms, parks, lakes, and pagodas. Additionally, residents would live in ecologically designed apartment buildings six to eight stories high but appropriately spaced apart as to avoid heat island effects. Although no construction of Dongtan has happened yet, these principles are generally applicable to all eco-cities.&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=SIno-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City: A Case Study of an Emerging Eco-City in China|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/01/17/000333037_20110117011432/Rendered/PDF/590120WP0P114811REPORT0FINAL1EN1WEB.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, increased urban density reduces [[urban sprawl]], thus, decreasing dependence on cars. According to Kenworthy, urban density is accountable for 84% of the variance in car travel.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenworthy|first=Jeffrey|title=The eco-city: ten key transport and planning dimensions for sustainable city development|url=http://eau.sagepub.com/content/18/1/67.full.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the compact urban layout of eco-cities, residents are able to easily navigate their surrounding environment on foot, by bicycle, or through use of public transportation. As a result, eco-cities avoid much of the negative effects of car pollution.

Additionally, by centralizing the population within a given area, eco-cities increase the amount of land that can be used for parks and [[urban agriculture]]. As such, eco-cities increase [[food security]] and promote ecological preservation within urban areas. Urban agriculture allows for “production of fresh food and vegetables, reduction on transportation load and enrichment of environmental quality” (Lim 2010).&lt;ref name="Eco-cities in Asia book" /&gt;

====Public health====
Eco-cities aid in creating healthier urban populations through the implementation of sustainable practices that improve environmental standards and, as a result, decrease the strain on [[public health]]. By employing practices that aim to reduce [[air pollution]], eco-city standards have an indirect effect on decreasing rates of [[respiratory disease]] within urban areas. According to the [[World Health Organization]], urban outdoor air pollution is responsible for over 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. Additionally, “the mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15–20%."&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Air quality and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the implementation of “clean” practices, eco-cities greatly assist in decreasing the disease burden placed on urban residents by decreasing the risk factors associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as various forms of cancer.

Additionally, the “greenspaces” that constitute the infrastructure of eco-cities provide a unique method of reducing air pollution and promoting clean air. Urban foliage naturally cleans the air by absorbing carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Green spaces also absorb airborne particulates and reduce heat, allowing for improved levels of public health.&lt;ref name="UNEP Green economy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards a Green Economy|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/documents/ger/GER_12_Cities.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Program|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decreased dependency on cars encouraged by the compact, walkable layout of eco-cities will also help combat [[obesity]] and other [[chronic diseases]] by encouraging frequent physical activity. The World Health Organization estimates that physical inactivity leads to 3.2 million deaths per year. 2.6 million of these deaths are centralized in low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Thus, by reducing urban sprawl, eco-cities may help decrease rates of [[coronary heart disease]] and [[stroke]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[colon cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Furthermore, by decreasing the concentration of cars within city limits, eco-cities are also able to reduce the number of preventable deaths among the working age population. It is estimated that traffic accidents kill 1.2 million people per year and is the leading cause of death among people under the age of 25 (WHO, 2011).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

Increased access to affordable vegetation via urban agriculture also permits the improvement of public health conditions by making healthy foods more available and affordable. Lye and Chen note, “An eco-city must not become or be perceived as an enclave for only the rich and powerful but must welcome and be accessible to people from various walks of life."&lt;ref name="Eco-cities in Asia book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fook|first=Lye Liang|title=Towards a Liveable and Sustainable Urban Environment: Eco-cities in Asia|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4287-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By investing in urban agriculture, eco-cities can help eliminate the prominent issue of [[food deserts]] in urban poor areas. Expanded access to vegetables will in hand aid in decreasing rates of obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other chronic illness, especially among low-income residents.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

===Technology and urban layout===

====Transportation====

By decreasing urban sprawl, eco-cities decrease the residential and commercial dependence on automobiles. Concurrently, improved public transportation further decreases the demand for cars. The development of [[metro station]] and [[light rail transit]] systems provide mass transit not only within sectors of a city but between cities.&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities" /&gt;  Furthermore, many eco-cities are employing expanded “clean” bus routes in order to decrease the emissions from single household vehicles. Critics note, however, that the high price of “clean” diesel, [[CNG]]/[[LNG]], [[hybrid electric buses]], and [[super capacitor]]-powered buses may not prove “economically and operationally viable” (World Bank, 2009).&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities" /&gt;

====Urbanism====
[[File:Jakriborg, juni 2005 c.jpg|thumb|[[Jakriborg]] in Sweden, started in the late 1990s as a [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] eco-friendly [[Planned community|new town]] near [[Malmö]]]]
Eco-cities may also seek to create [[sustainable city|sustainable urban]] environments with long-lasting structures, buildings and a great liveability for its inhabitants. The most clearly defined form of [[Walkability|walkable]] [[urbanism]] is known as the ''Charter of [[New Urbanism]]''. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=2010-12-24 }}. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.

In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]] promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as opposing solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s.

====Landscape====
Eco-cities primarily employ [[green roofs]], vertical landscaping, and bridge links as methods of decreasing the environmental impact of land use. Constructing green roofs and investing in vertical landscaping create natural insulation for residential and commercial properties as well as allows for rainfall collection. Additionally, green roofs and vertical landscaping lower urban temperatures and help prevent the [[heat island effect]]. Bridge links allow for development of a walkable city without disrupting the soil to run utility lines by connecting buildings with above ground walkways.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Energy====
[[File:London Building With Integrated Wind Turbines.jpg|thumb|London skyscraper with integrated wind turbines]]
Eco-cities look to employ [[renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panels]], and [[biogas]], to reduce emissions. Wind turbines present the opportunity of being able to provide both localized districts within eco-cities and the larger region as a whole with emission-free renewable energy that can additionally supplement existing power sources.  Furthermore, by designing buildings with [[natural ventilation]] systems, eco-cities reduce the need for air conditioning, thus, drastically decreasing commercial and residential energy use. The energy generated can come from large scale energy production systems such as solar farms which supply many homes and businesses or from individual buildings energying at least in part their own energy from solar photovoltaic or small scale wind turbines or biomass.
Many eco-cities additionally look to deploy [[solar thermal energy]]. By installing [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]], developers will be able to provide hot water for space heating and individual and community needs while reducing dependence on gas fueled boilers. While solar thermal energy appears to be a more efficient source of renewable energy, many urban planners also view [[photovoltaics]] as a viable source of energy. Photovoltaics directly convert solar energy into electricity; however, the extensive costs associated with developing this technology on the city-scale may limit its use when compared to its potential payback.  [[Biogas]] technology is also deployed as a source of renewable energy as the organic material from wastewater is converted into fuel.&lt;ref name="Biogas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purac.se/2010/02/purac-launches-new-biogas-technology-eco-city-china/?lang=en|title=Purac launches new biogas technology for Eco-city in China|publisher=Lackeby Water Group|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
Eco-cities aim to decrease water consumption by employing technologies that reduce the amount of water that is needed for [[irrigation]] and sewage flow while also preventing [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and [[greywater]] runoff from entering [[ground water]] sources. Developers suggest installing [[low flow]] fixtures, [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] to meet eco-city standards. Additionally, advanced irrigation systems ([[xeriscaping]]) aid in maintaining [[green infrastructure]] while decreasing green space consumption of water for irrigation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Leading eco-cities==

===Curitiba, Brazil===
The city of [[Curitiba, Brazil]] proactively began to address the challenges of sustainable urban development in 1966 with a master plan that outlined future integration between [[urban development]], [[transportation]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities"&gt;{{cite book|title=Eco2 Cities: Ecological Cities as Economic Cities|year=2010|publisher=World Bank Publications|author=Hiroaki Suzuki|author2=Arish Dastur |author3=Sebastian Moffatt |author4=Nane Yabuki |author5=Hinako Maruyama |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan has been realized in modern Curitiba, which is defined by linear stretches of urban development surrounded by green space and low-density residential areas.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; The city was designed for the mobility of people, not the mobility of cars. The city’s bus system is highly developed, with high-capacity busses and dedicated lanes, it effectively reaches about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;  This bus system is utilized by 45% of the population, which has caused private automobile use to drop to 22%.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Despite this decline, to prevent congestion central areas of the city have been closed to cars. These road closures have led to dynamic economic growth for local shops and the development of community space for pedestrians.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

[[File:Curitiba Brazil Structure.jpg|thumb|Linear urban development in Curitiba contrasted with surrounding residential development]]

The resulting public health and education gains from this initiative have also been substantial. Curitiba maintains the lowest air pollution rates in Brazil and over 300,000 trees in the city helps reduce natural flooding.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Curitiba has also dedicated resources to [[environmental education]] in primary school, which has translated into environmentally conscious citizens. Over 70% of city residents participate in recycling programs which fuels the city’s progressive waste processing system.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

Curitiba has maintained a consistent vision of the future and worked to attain it by through careful urban planning that takes into account transportation, while also encouraging environmental initiatives and public health. In 2010, Curitiba recognized for their achievement with the Globe Sustainable City Award due to “their understanding of sustainable city development – both regarding policy and implementation.”&lt;ref name="Globe Award Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe Award|url=http://globeaward.org/winner-city-2010|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroville, India===

[[Auroville]] was founded in 1968 with the intention of realizing human unity, and is now home to approximately 2,300 individuals from over 45 nations around the world (substantially less than the 50,000 anticipated). Its focus is its vibrant community culture and its expertise in renewable energy systems, habitat restoration, ecology skills, mindfulness practices, and holistic education.

===Freiburg, Germany===
The city of [[Freiburg, Germany]], whose sustainable policies date all the way back to the 1970s, has constructed itself as a sustainable city by actively committing to its target areas of energy, transportation, and to its three pillars for sustainable development: energy saving, new technology, and renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freiburg in a pathway towards a sustainable city|url=http://www.wwf.fi/wwf/www/uploads/pdf/sustainable_model_city_freiburg_in_germany.pdf|publisher=Gaia Consulting|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest motivators for success can be accredited to citizen’s engagement; in the 1970s opposition to local nuclear power led to the creation of a campaign for sustainable solutions for the energy needs of the city. A network of environmentalists, research organizations, and businesses was established, helping the agenda of a sustainable city push forward.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt;
	
Taking advantage of Freiburg’s location, educated and active residents, and political priorities invested in the environment and economy has led Freiburg to be considered a Solar Capital.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green City-Freiburg|url=http://www.fwtm.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/show/1199617_l2/GreenCity_E.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with high solar electricity rates,&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt; Freiburg hosts such innovations as the world’s first football stadium with its own solar power plant and the world’s first self-sustaining solar energy building.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt; In terms of both ecology and economy, Freiburg has been extremely successful in the fields of research and marketing of renewable energy. The Freiburg science network and solar industry embraces many research institutions, like the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]], Europe’s largest solar research institute.
	
In addition to solar initiatives, over the last four decades Freiburg has made improvements to their transportation systems.&lt;ref name="Germany to test first smart road in Europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany to test first smart road in Europe|url=http://www.slashgear.com/hamburg-germany-to-test-first-smart-road-in-europe-11396318/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freiburg has over 500&amp;nbsp;km of bicycle paths and more than 5000 bicycle parking spaces as well as car-free centers, 30 kph zones, a region wide bus service, and tram lines.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt;
	
Long before it was taken seriously Freiburg was resolving to cut [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. In 1966, the city resolved to lower carbon dioxide by 25 percent by 2010. Although they did not reach their initial goal by 2010, they are continually extending their goals. By 2030, they resolved to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent and be climate neutral by 2050.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;

Freiburg also focuses initiatives on [[waste management]]. Paper products are composed to 80 percent recycled materials. Financial incentive programs, like discounts for collective waste disposal and people who compost, are used to increase waste avoidance. Since 2005, Freiburg’s non-recyclable waste has been incinerated and the heat energy released is converted to supply electricity to almost 25,000 households in the city.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;
	
Freiburg is a green city. 43 percent of borough area is woodland. In 2001, the Freiburg Woodland Convention was adopted and since 2009, the city officially supported the Freiburg Convention on the Protection of Ancient Woodland. For over 20 years Freiburg has worked to maintain their public parks with principles that work with nature: they no longer use pesticides, grass is mown less, and almost 50,000 trees line streets and parks.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;

===Stockholm, Sweden===
[[Stockholm]] in Sweden has been an environmentally focused city that is redeveloping itself to become an eco-city through efficient [[urban planning]] and resource use. Stockholm has established six environmental goals, called Vision 2030, that act as the foundation of this initiative. These goals include development of efficient transportation, sustainable energy, land, and water use, waste treatment improvements, and safe building and product materials.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Beyond Vision 2030, Stockholm is planning to be fossil fuel free by 2050.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

In terms of urban planning, Stockholm currently requires mandatory reuse of land before [[urban sprawl]] can continue.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This policy has led to complete revitalization of run-down and abandoned industrial areas that have been transformed into modern, efficient and integrated residential and business communities.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; The [[Hammarby Sjostad]] district of Stockholm is the primary example of this practice, as this resurrected industrial area has become twice as energy efficient as the rest of the city after an environmentally focused redevelopment.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

These gains are measured by the environmental load profile of the area, a [[life-cycle assessment]] tool developed by the City of Stockholm, the [[Royal Institute of Technology]], and a consultancy firm.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This unique measure allows for environmental performance analyses, on both the small and large scale, in terms of environmental costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This comprehensive measure has allowed Stockholm to quantify their environmental progress and could be applied as a decision-making tool in other cities or districts to aid their environmental efforts.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

Stockholm has pursued [[green development]] and optimization of urban systems and achieved results. These efforts were recognized in 2010 by [[European Union]], which deemed Stockholm the European Green Capital for “leading the way towards environmentally friendly urban living.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Green Capital |url=http://international.stockholm.se/Stockholm-by-theme/European-Green-Capital/ |publisher=City of Stockholm |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524154357/http://international.stockholm.se/Stockholm-by-theme/European-Green-Capital/ |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adelaide, Australia===

'''Urban forests'''

In Adelaide, South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliontrees.com.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924184135/http://www.milliontrees.com.au/ |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar power'''

The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the Museum, Art Gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.

'''Wind power'''

South Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In 5 years to 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theclimategroup.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste recycling'''

For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced.  Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle/can/container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Despite the sustainability, efficiency and other established benefits of ecocities, actual implementation can be difficult to attain. Existing infrastructure, both in terms of the physical city layout and existing local bureaucracy, are major, often insurmountable, obstacles to large-scale sustainable development.&lt;ref name="World Bank Eco2 Cities" /&gt; The high cost of the technological integration necessary for eco-city development is a major challenge, as many cities either can’t afford, or are not willing to take on, the extra costs.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; New-build eco-cities avoid these problems.

Challenges associated with planning and managing sustainable programs are also large. Cities that want to become more sustainable are faced with retrofitting existing structures and concurrent management of sustainable urban expansion and development. The costs and infrastructure needed to manage these large scale, two-pronged projects are great, and beyond the capabilities of most cities.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; In addition, many cities around the world are currently struggling to maintain the status quo, with budgetary issues, high rates of poverty, transportation inefficiencies, and rapid [[population growth]] encouraging reactive, coping policy.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; While there are many examples worldwide, the development of ecocities is still limited due to the vast challenges and high costs associated with sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10941">An '''equivalence group''' is a set of unspecified cells that have the same developmental potential or ability to adopt various [[Cell fate determination|fates]]. Our{{Who|date=October 2012}} current understanding suggests that equivalence groups are limited to cells of the same ancestry, also known as sibling cells.&lt;ref name=satoh89&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida and Satoh|title=Determination and regulation in the pigment cell lineage of the ascidian embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=132|issue=2 |pages=355–67|year=1989 |pmid=2494088 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(89)90232-7 |last2=Satoh |first2=N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, cells of an equivalence group adopt different fates from one another.&lt;ref name=greenwald&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwald and Rubin|title=Making a difference: the role of cell-cell interactions in establishing separate identities for equivalent cells|journal=Cell|volume=68|issue=2|pages=271–81|year=1992|pmid=1365402 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90470-W |last2=Rubin |first2=GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalence groups assume various potential fates in two general, non-mutually exclusive ways.  One mechanism, induction, occurs when a signal originating from outside of the equivalence group specifies a subset of the naïve cells.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;  Another mode, known as [[lateral inhibition]], arises when a signal within an equivalence group causes one cell to adopt a dominant fate while others in the group are inhibited from doing so.&lt;ref name=Nishida97&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida|title=Notch homologue from Halocynthia roretzi is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system during ascidian embryogenesis|journal=Dev Genes Evol|volume=207|pages=371–380|year=1997|doi=10.1007/s004270050126 |last2=Saitoh |first2=Takashi |last3=Matsumoto |first3=Midori |last4=Makabe |first4=Kazuhiro W. |last5=Nishida |first5=H. |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many examples of equivalence groups, both induction and lateral inhibition are used to define patterns of distinct cell types.  

Cells of an equivalence group that do not receive a signal adopt a default fate.  Alternatively, cells that receive a signal take on different fates.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang and Weisblat|title=Cell fate determination in an annelid equivalence group|journal=Development|volume=122|issue=6|pages=1839–47|year=1996|pmid=8674423 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a certain point, the fates of cells within an equivalence group become irreversibly determined, thus they lose their [[multipotent]] potential.  The following provides examples of equivalence groups studied in [[nematodes]] and [[ascidians]].

==Vulva Precursor Cell Equivalence Group==

[[Image:VPCs.png|thumb|400px|alt=Vulva Precursor Cell Equivalence Group|Model for the determination of the VPCs (cells P3.p-P8.p) in C. elegans. An inductive signal from the anchor cell via LIN-3 determines P6.p to adopt the 1°. Then, the lateral signal LIN-12 causes P5.p and P5.7 to become 2°. The other VPCs do not receive an inductive signal and are fated as 3°. Anterior is to the left.]]

===Introduction===
A classic example of an equivalence group is the vulva precursor cells (VPCs) of nematodes.  In ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' self-fertilized eggs exit the body through the [[vulva]].  This organ develops from a subset of cell of an equivalence group consisting of six VPCs, P3.p-P8.p, which lie ventrally along the anterior-posterior axis.&lt;ref name=Kornfeld&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kornfeld|title=Vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Trends Genet|volume=13|issue=2 |pages=55–61|year=1997|pmid=9055606 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(97)01005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example a single overlying somatic cells, the anchor cell, induces nearby VPCs to take on vulva fates 1° (P6.p) and 2° (P5.p and P7.p).  VPCs that are not induced form the 3° lineage (P3.p, P4.p and P8.p), which make epidermal cells that fuse to a large syncytial epidermis (see image).&lt;ref name=Sternberg86&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg and Horvitz|title=Pattern formation during vulval development in C. elegans|journal=Cell|volume=44|issue=5 |pages=761–72|year=1986|pmid=3753901 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90842-1 |last2=Horvitz |first2=HR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six VPCs form an equivalence group because all of the six cells are competent to take on any of the available fates (1°, 2°, and 3°) dependent on their proximity to the anchor cell.  Ablation experiments indicate that all VPCs are able to adopt vulva fates.  For example, if the P6.p cell that normally becomes 1° is ablated then the VPC closest to the anchor cell, either P5.p or P7.p, assumes the 1° fate.  Furthermore, if all VPCs are destroyed except the most anterior P3.p cell then the anchor cell designates this cell the 1° fate.  However, if the anchor cell is killed, in the absence of an inductive signal, then all of the VPCs assume the default 3° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg|title=Vulva Development|journal=Sternberg|volume=25|pages=1–28|year=2005|pmid=18050418|doi=10.1895/wormbook.1.6.1|pmc=4781130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular Mechanism===
The anchor cell directly induces the vulva fates by secreting the [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF)-like ligand LIN-3.  The P6.p cell receives the LIN-3 signal via the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] LET-23 (P5.p and P7.p also receive LIN-3 but to a lesser extent).  Activation of LET-23 in P6.p results in the activation of LIN-12 ([[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]]) in P5.p and P7.p.  Experimental evidence shows that LIN-12 is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the 2° fate.  Through lateral inhibition LIN-12 prevents the P5.p and P7.p cells from adopting the 1° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook /&gt;  Thus, in this example both inductive EGF signaling and lateral Notch activation patterns the VPC equivalence group.

==Ascidian Pigment Precursor Equivalence Group==

[[Image:Otolith Ocellus.png|thumb|400px|alt=Otolith and Ocellus|Two bilateral pigment precursor cells form an equivalence group that eventually interacts to seal mutually exclusive fates (otolith and ocellus). Shown is a timeline of the developing Halocythia roretzi embryo (anterior is to the left). Pigment precursor cells (gray circles) remain equivalent until they align after neurulation. At 21 hours post fertilization the ocellus (white circle) and otolith (black circle) are determined.]]

===Introduction===
The larvae of ascidians (sea squirts) contain a pair of sensory [[melanocyte|pigment cells]] known as the [[otolith]] and [[ocellus]].  The otolith is used to sense gravity, whereas the ocellus responds to light.  During embryogenesis the otolith and ocellus develop from two bilateral equivalent precursors.  Either the left or right pigment precursor cell has equal probability of developing into the otolith or ocellus.  The decision to adopt either fate is determined after neural tube closure during the early tailbud stage (see image), via a poorly defined mechanism of induction.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  

During normal development, after [[neural tube]] closure, the pigment precursors align dorsally along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube.  Whichever cell aligns anteriorly will become the otolith, while the posterior cell will form the ocellus.  In the absence of cell-cell interactions both cells develop into ocelli, which is the default fate.&lt;ref name=Nishida97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Akanuma&gt;{{cite journal |author=Akanuma|title=Notch signaling is involved in nervous system formation in ascidian embryos|journal=Development Genes and Evolution|volume=212|issue=10|pages=459–72|year=2002|pmid=12424517|doi=10.1007/s00427-002-0264-x |display-authors=1 |last2=Hori |first2=Sawako |last3=Darras |first3=S&amp;#x000E9;Bastien |last4=Nishida |first4=Hiroki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental Methods for Studying Equivalence in ''Halocynthia roretzi''===
To elucidate whether the fates of the otolith and ocellus are determined in the early embryo or after the precursors align during neural tube closure, ablation and drug treatment techniques were used in the ascidian species ''[[Sea pineapple|Halocythia roretzi]]''. 

Cells that are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FDX) can be selectively photoablated by fluorescent excitation.&lt;ref name=Shankland&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shankland and Weisblat|title=Stepwise commitment of blast cell fates during the positional specification of the O and P cell lines in the leech embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=106|issue=2|pages=326–42|year=1984|pmid=6500176 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(84)90231-8 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When one FDX labeled pigment precursor cells is photoablated during the mid-neurula stage (15 hrs) the other will almost always develop into an ocellus.  However, if the ablations are performed during the late tailbud stage (22.5 hrs) then the remaining cell has an equal likelihood of becoming an otolith or ocellus.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt; 

Inhibiting cell division and [[morphogenesis]] with [[cytochalasin B]] is another method used to determine when the pigment precursor equivalence group is specified.  Cytochalasin treatment of early tailbud stage embryos (17 hrs), while the two bilateral cells are still separated, results in both cells becoming ocelli.  When the drug was used after the two cells aligned at the dorsal midline, the anterior cell developed into the otolith and the posterior cell became the ocellus without exception.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  Both experiments suggest that fates of the pigment precursor cells are irreversibly determined by approximately the mid-tailbud stage (21 hrs).

==Other Equivalence Groups==

Equivalence groups have also been described in the [[ganglion]] mother cells in grasshopper and the O/P [[teloblasts]] in the [[leech]].&lt;ref name="Kuwada and Goodman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuwada and Goodman|title=Neuronal determination during embryonic development of the grasshopper nervous system|journal=Dev Biol|volume=110|issue=1|pages=114–26|year=1985|pmid=4007260 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(85)90069-7 |last2=Goodman |first2=CS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuo and Shankland|title=Evolutionary diversification of specification mechanisms within the O/P equivalence group of the leech genus Helobdella|journal=Development|volume=131|issue=23|pages=5859–69|year=2004|pmid=15525668|doi=10.1242/dev.01452 |last2=Shankland |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other instances of equivalence groups, progeny cells are born equivalent and become specified through cell interactions.  Equivalence groups are a common theme in the development of many organisms from diverse [[Phylum|phyla]].

The '''Faculty of Political Sciences at Sakarya University''' ({{lang-tr|Siyasal Bilgiler Fakültesi}}, also known as '''SAU SBF''') is one of the sixteen faculties that comprise [[Sakarya University]]. Originally established as Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences in 1992, it was named as the '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' by decree no. 28988 on 2 May 2014.
The faculty spans a range of "discipline areas" and includes Political Science and Public Administration, International Relations, Economics, Labor Economics and Industrial Relations, Public Finance, and Financial Econometrics. The SAU SBF has more than 80 full-time faculty and more than 40 research assistants.&lt;ref&gt;http://sbf.sakarya.edu.tr/en/3107/akademik_kadro&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' at Sakarya University was originally established as Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences by decree no. 3837 on 11 July 1992.

During 1993-1996, [[Sabahattin Zaim]] (1926-2007) served as the first and founding dean of the faculty. As an active member of religious-conservative Society to Disseminate Science (Ilim Yayma Cemiyeti), Zaim put his stamp on the faculty. Some academics served in the faculty during Zaim's period would become the leading figures of conservative/Islamic parties in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;See, Doğan Gürpınar, Türkiye'de Aydının Kısa Tarihi, Istanbul: Etkilesim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is believed that Zaim invited [[Abdullah Gül]], the 11th President of Turkey, to the faculty,&lt;ref&gt;http://sbf.sakarya.edu.tr/tr/icerik/8809/6905/gecmisteki-degerli-hocalarimiz&lt;/ref&gt; official documents of Sakarya University proves it wrong. Gül actually served in Sakarya University between 1977 and 1983, long before the establishment of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakaryayenihaber.com/10503-gul-un-adapazari-gunleri-haberi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gül was assistant of Sabahattin Zaim, it seems that he has never been in the Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences. On the other hand, Zaim's another assistant [[Sami Güçlü]] took an active role in the development of the faculty. Güçlü would be the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in religious-conservative Justice and Development Party government. However, Zaim's influence on the faculty ended after [[1997 Turkish military memorandum]] in Turkey and many professors, who were close to Zaim, left from the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Necati Mert, Memleket Kitabevi, Istanbul: Iletisim, 2003, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Siyasalfakultesi.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Building of Faculty of Political Sciences]]
The current building of the faculty was constructed in 1998&lt;ref&gt;"Sakarya, Para Arıyor", Milliyet, 14 July 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but it was devastatingly affected by the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]]. One of its staff, Seydi Önder, lost his life during earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yokten-5-trilyon-39099047&lt;/ref&gt; Although the faculty moved to prefabs for a while, consecutive earthquakes interrupted education. During the winter semester of 1999-2000 academic year, the faculty suspended its education.&lt;ref&gt;"Sakarya'da Yaz Mesaisi", Milliyet, 22 November 1999, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty restarted its regular education on 28 February 2000.

== Departments ==
When Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences inaugurated its education in 1992, it was hosting two departments, Economics, and Management. The department of Labor Economics and Industrial Relations, the department of Public Administration (later Political Science and Public Administration), and the department of International Relations were established between 1994 and 1996. While the department of Public Finance was established in 2002, the department of Financial Econometrics inaugurated its education in 2008. In November 2010, three departments, Management, Tourism Management, and Human Resources Management left from the faculty and they were transferred to the newly established Faculty of Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finansal.sakarya.edu.tr/tr/icerik/6023/8076/tarihce&lt;/ref&gt; Under the SAU SBF, the existing departments are as the followings:

* Political Science and Public Administration
* [[Department of International Relations, Sakarya University|International Relations]]
* Economics
* Labor Economics and Industrial Relations
* Public Finance
* Financial Econometrics

==Research Centers==
The SAU SBF hosted a variety of research centers but some of them were either closed or restructured as institutes. For example, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies was established by the faculty's professors but later it was restructured as an institute under the name [[Sakarya University Middle East Institute]]. The SAU SBF currently hosts three research centers.

* Center for European Union Research and Documentation, ({{lang-tr|Avrupa Birliği Araştırma Dokümantasyon Birimi}}), provides independent, and balanced analysis to help policymakers and researchers navigate the complex politics and economy of the European Union.
* Sakarya Economic and Social Research Center, ({{lang-tr|Sakarya Ekonomik ve Sosyal Araştırmalar Merkezi}})
* Research and Practice Center for Diaspora Studies, ({{lang-tr|Diaspora Çalışmaları Uygulama ve Araştırma Merkezi}})&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haber7.com/sakarya/1737445-sauden-almanya-hak-ve-ozgurlukler-raporu-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fructification''' ({{Lang-la|fructificatio}}) are the generative parts of the [[plant]] ([[flower]] and [[fruit]]) (as opposed to its vegetative parts: [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], [[root]]s and [[Leaf|leaves]]). Sometimes it is applied more broadly to the generative parts of [[gymnosperm]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]], though they produce neither fruit nor flower.

Since the works of [[Andrea Caesalpino]] (1519–1603) the characters of fructification have been extensively used as a basis for the [[scientific classification]] of plants. [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) raised the description of the parts of fructification to an unprecedented level of precision. He insisted that [[genus|genera]] and the higher groups of plants must be characterised in terms of the fructification alone without using vegetative parts (which can be used only to characterise the [[species]] within genera). At that time it was believed that all plants have flowers and fruits. It was not until the nineteenth century that the important difference between [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s was recognised and the use of terms flower and fruit was restricted to the flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s).

Later plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] used a more balanced approach and re-introduced the use of the vegetative parts of the plant as a basis for characters at different levels of taxonomic [[hierarchy]].

'''Geomatics''' is defined in the [[ISO/TC 211]] series of standards as the "[[academic discipline|discipline]] concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of [[geographic data or geographic information]]".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/TR 19122:2004(en)
Geographic information/Geomatics — Qualification and certification of personnel [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:19122:ed-1:v1:en]&lt;/ref&gt; Under another definition it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedgeomatics.net/about-us.html|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=Applied Geomatics Research Laboratory|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes '''geomatics engineering''' (and [[surveying engineering]]) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).

==Overview and etymology ==

Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced ''geomatics'' as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in ''The Canadian Surveyor'' and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the [[Canadian Institute of Geomatics|Canadian Institute of Surveying]] in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Paradis|first1= Michel|title= De l'arpentage à la géomatique|journal= Le géomètre canadien|date= September 1981|volume= 35| issue = 3|page=262 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in [[land surveying]], [[remote sensing]], [[cartography]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[Satellite navigation|global-navigation satellite systems]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[Compass navigation system|Compass]]), [[photogrammetry]], [[geophysics]], [[geography]], and related forms of earth [[map]]ping. The term was originally used in [[Canada]], because it is similar in origin to both French and English,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} but has since been adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the [[United States]]) have shown a preference for the term ''geospatial technology''.{{ref}}{{verify source|date=April 2015}}

The related field of ''hydrogeomatics'' covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of [[hydrography|hydrographics]] was considered{{by whom|date=April 2015}} too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.

A ''geospatial network'' is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One example of such a network is the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]'s efforts to provide ''ready global access to geographic information''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A number{{quantify|date=April 2015}} of university departments which were once titled "surveying", "survey engineering" or "[[topographic]] science" have re-titled themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".

The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in [[computer]] hardware, [[computer science]], and [[software engineering]], as well as by airborne and space observation [[remote-sensing]] technologies.

The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of geomatics.

'''Geospatial science''' is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as [[surveying]], [[geographic information systems]], [[hydrography]] and [[cartography]]. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.&lt;ref name="QUT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |title=Queensland University of Technology, ''Undergratuate Program - Spatial Science (Surveying)'' |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719223038/http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |archive-date=2008-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering {{anchor|Geomatics engineering}} ==
{{cleanup merge|Geomatics engineering|date=April 2016}}
'''Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering''' is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.

Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land [[surveying engineering]] along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from [[data science]] and [[cartography]] to [[geography]]. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.

Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.

The more traditional [[land surveying]] strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of [[real property]] parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land descriptions.  The tasks more closely related to [[civil engineering]] include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and control surveys for construction projects.

Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital [[theodolite]]/distance meter total stations, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.

Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of interdisciplinary fields.

In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with the name [[surveying]] in some, and in others with the names geomatics, geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in [[civil engineering]] education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data sciences under [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]] or [[applied mathematics]]. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering.
The job of ''geospatial engineer'' is well established in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/construction-engineering/geospatial-engineer.html|title=Geospatial Engineer Jobs (12Y)|author=|date=|website=goarmy.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalguard.com/12y-geospatial-engineer|title=12Y Geospatial Engineer - National Guard|author=|date=|website=www.nationalguard.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George L Mosse.jpg|thumb|George Mosse at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, 1991]]
'''George Lachmann Mosse''' (September 20, 1918 – January 22, 1999) was an emigre from [[Nazi Germany]] first to Great Britain and then to the United States who taught history as a professor at the [[University of Iowa]], the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], and the [[Hebrew University]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Pace, [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/world/george-l-mosse-dies-at-80-authority-on-nazi-germany.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=World&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article obituary], ''New York Times'', 31 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Best known for his studies of [[Nazism]], he authored more than 25 books on topics as diverse as constitutional history, [[Protestant theology]], and the history of [[masculinity]]. In 1966, he and [[Walter Laqueur]] founded ''[[The Journal of Contemporary History]]'', which they co-edited.

==Biography==
Mosse was born in [[Berlin]] to a prominent, well-to-do [[German Jewish]] family. His maternal grandfather, [[Rudolf Mosse]], founded what became Germany's largest advertising agency, and his media empire included the respected liberal newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''. His father, [[Hans Lachmann-Mosse]], commissioned the architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]] to redesign the iconic [[Mossehaus]] where the ''Tageblatt'' was published. In his autobiography, George Mosse described himself as a mischievous child given to pranks. He was educated at the noted [[Mommsen-Gymnasium]] in Berlin and from 1928 onwards at [[Schule Schloss Salem]], a famously spartan boarding school that exposed the scions of rich and powerful families to a life devoid of privilege. The headmaster at Salem, [[Kurt Hahn]], was an advocate of [[experiential education]] and required all pupils to engage in physically challenging outdoor activities. Although Mosse disliked the school's nationalistic ethos, he conceded that its emphasis on character building and leadership gave him "some backbone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confronting History – A Memoir |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |page=69 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred individual sports, such as skiing, to team activities.

In 1933, with Hitler's rise to power, the Mosse family emigrated and separated. His mother, Felicia (1888-1972), and his sister, [[Hilde Mosse|Hilde]] (1912-1982), relocated to Switzerland, while his father moved to France, where in 1939 he got a divorce, married Karola Strauch (the mother of Harvard physicist Karl Strauch), and subsequently emigrated to California.  George Mosse moved to England, where he enrolled at the [[Quakers|Quaker]] [[Bootham School]] in [[York]].  It was here, according to his autobiography, that he first became aware of his homosexuality. A struggling student, he failed several exams, but with the financial support of his parents he was admitted to study history at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting History'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Here he first developed an interest in historical scholarship, attending lectures by [[G. M. Trevelyan]] and [[Helen Cam|Helen Maude Cam]]. While he was at Cambridge, his hostility to [[fascism]] was deepened by the [[Spanish Civil War]] (although he later averred that he had only a superficial understanding of the conflict).

In 1939, his family relocated to the United States, and he continued his undergraduate studies at the Quaker [[Haverford College]], earning a B.A. in 1941. He went on to graduate studies at [[Harvard University]], where he benefited from a scholarship reserved for students born in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. His 1946 Ph.D. dissertation on English constitutional history of the 16th and 17th centuries, supervised by [[Charles Howard McIlwain]], was subsequently published as ''The Struggle for Sovereignty in England'' (1950).

Mosse's first academic appointment as an historian was at the [[University of Iowa]], where he focused on religion in early modern Europe and published a concise study of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] that became a widely used textbook. In 1955, he moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and began to lecture on modern history. His ''The Culture of Western Europe: The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, an Introduction'' (1961), which summarizes these lectures, was also widely adopted as a textbook.

Mosse taught for more than thirty years at the University of Wisconsin, where he was named a John C. Bascom Professor of European History and a Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies, while concurrently holding the Koebner Professorship of History at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Beginning in 1969, Mosse spent one semester each year teaching at the Hebrew University. He also held appointments as a visiting professor at the [[University of Tel Aviv]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. After retiring from the University of Wisconsin, he taught at Cambridge University and [[Cornell University]]. He was named the first research historian in residence at the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]].

==Scholarship==
Mosse's first published work was a 1947 paper in the ''[[Economic History Review]]'' describing the [[Anti-Corn Law League]]. He claimed that this was the first time the landed gentry had tried to organize a mass movement in order to counter their opponents. In ''The Holy Pretence'' (1957), he suggested that a thin line divides truth and falsehood in [[Puritan casuistry]]. Mosse declared that he approached history not as narrative, but as a series of questions and possible answers. The narrative provides the framework within which the problem of interest can be addressed. A constant theme in his work is the fate of [[liberalism]]. Critics pointed out that he had made [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Sir Edward Coke]], the chief character of his book ''The Struggle for Sovereignty in England'' (1950), into a liberal long before liberalism had come into existence. Reviewers noted that the sub-text in his ''The Culture of Western Europe'' (1961) was the triumph of [[totalitarianism]] over liberalism.

His most well-known book, ''The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' (1964), analyses the origins of the nationalist belief system. Mosse claimed, however, that it was not until his book ''The Nationalization of the Masses'' (1975), which dealt with the sacralization of politics, that he began to put his own stamp upon the analysis of cultural history. He started to write it in the [[Jerusalem]] apartment of the historian [[Jacob Talmon]], surrounded by the works of [[Rousseau]]. Mosse sought to draw attention to the role played by myth, symbol, and political liturgy in the [[French Revolution]]. Rousseau, he noted, went from believing that "the people" could govern themselves in town meetings, to urging that the government of Poland invent public ceremonies and festivals in order to imbue the people with allegiance to the nation. Mosse argued that there was a continuity between his work on the Reformation and his work on more recent history. He claimed that it was not a big step from Christian belief systems to modern civic religions such as nationalism.

In the ''Crisis of German Ideology'', he traced how the "[[German Revolution]]" became anti-Jewish, and in ''Towards the Final Solution'' (1979) he wrote a general history of [[racism in Europe]]. He argued that although [[racism]] was originally directed towards blacks, it was subsequently applied to Jews. In ''Nationalism and Sexuality: Respectable and Abnormal Sexuality in Modern Europe'' (1985), he claimed that there was a link between male [[eros (concept)|eros]], the [[German youth movement]], and ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' thought. Because of the dominance of the male image in so much nationalism, he decided to write the history of that stereotype in ''The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity'' (1996).

Mosse saw nationalism, which often includes racism, as the chief menace of modern times. As a Jew, he regarded the rejection of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe as a personal threat, as it was the Enlightenment spirit which had liberated the Jews. He noted that European nationalism had initially tried to combine patriotism, human rights, cosmopolitanism, and tolerance. It was only later that France and then Germany came to believe that they had a monopoly on virtue. In developing this view Mosse was influenced by [[Peter Viereck]], who argued that the turn towards aggressive nationalism first arose in the era of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]]. Mosse traced the origins of Nazism in ''völkisch'' ideology back to a 19th-century organicist worldview that fused pseudo-scientific nature philosophy with mystical notions of German soul. The Nazis made ''völkisch'' thinking accessible to the broader public via potent rhetoric, powerful symbols, and mass rituals. Mosse demonstrated that [[antisemitism]] drew on stereotypes that depicted the Jew as the enemy of the German ''[[Volk]]''; an embodiment of the urban, materialistic, scientific culture that was supposedly responsible for the corruption of the German spirit.

In ''Toward the Final Solution'', he claimed that racial stereotypes were rooted in the European tendency to classify human beings according to their closeness or distance from Greek ideals of beauty. ''Nationalism and Sexuality: Middle-Class Morality and Sexual Norms in Modern Europe'' extended these insight to encompass other excluded or persecuted groups: Jews, homosexuals, [[Romani people]], and the mentally ill. Many 19th-century thinkers relied upon binary stereotypes that categorized human beings either as "healthy" or "degenerate", "normal" or "abnormal", "insiders" or "outsiders". In ''The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity'', Mosse argued that middle-class male respectability evoked "counter-type" images of men whose weakness, nervousness, and effeminacy threatened to undermine an ideal of manhood.

Mosse's upbringing attuned him to both the advantages and the dangers of a humanistic education. His book ''German Jews Beyond Judaism'' (1985) describes how the German-Jewish dedication to ''Bildung'', or cultivation, helped Jews to transcend their group identity. But it also argues that during the [[Weimar Republic]], ''Bildung'' contributed to a blindness toward the illiberal political realities that later engulfed Jewish families. Mosse's liberalism also informed his supportive but critical stance toward [[Zionism]] and the [[State of Israel]]. In an essay written on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Zionism, he wrote that the early Zionists envisioned a liberal commonwealth based on individualism and solidarity, but a "more aggressive, exclusionary and normative nationalism eventually came to the fore."

Historian James Franklin argues that:
: as a teacher and scholar, George Mosse has posed challenging questions about what it means to be an intellectual engaged in the world. The central problem Mosse has examined throughout his career is: how do intellectuals relate their ideas to reality or to alternative views of that reality?.... Mosse has chosen to focus on intellectuals and the movements with which they were often connected at their most intemperate.... For Mosse, the role of the historian is one of political engagement; he or she must delineate the connections (and disconnections) between myth and reality.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Franklin, "Mosse, George L." in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writers'' (1999) 2:841.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction as a teacher==
At the University of Wisconsin, George Mosse was recognized as a charismatic and inspiring teacher. Tom Bates' ''Rads: A True Story of the End of the Sixties'' (1992) describes how students flocked to Mosse's courses to "savor the crossfire" with his friend and rival, the [[Marxist]] historian [[Harvey Goldberg]]. Mosse charmed his students by mingling critical skepticism with humor, irony, and empathy; but they also admired the way he applied his historical knowledge to contemporary issues, attempting to be fair to opposing views while remaining true to his own principles.

==Legacy==
Mosse left a substantial bequest to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to establish the George L. Mosse Program in History, a collaborative program with the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. He also left modest endowments to support [[Queer studies|LGBT studies]] at both the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he taught as a visiting professor.  These endowments were funded by the restitution of the Mosse family's properties expropriated by the Nazi regime that were not restored until 1989-90, following the collapse of [[East Germany]].

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose [[polymer]] that functions as energy storage in [[plant]]s. It has a structure similar to [[amylopectin]] (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white [[powder (substance)|powders]] in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryley|first1=JF|title=Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. 5.

Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units.&lt;ref&gt;Manners, D. J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 16, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko &amp; Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 1429203145 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a [[glycogenin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg|year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration#Units|millimoles]] (18&amp;nbsp;mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.&lt;ref name="pmid1615908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreitzman SN, Coxon AY, Szaz KF | title=Glycogen storage: illusions of easy weight loss, excessive weight regain, and distortions in estimates of body composition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=56 | issue=1 Suppl | year=1992 | pages=292s–93s  | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/1/292S.full.pdf | id= | pmid=1615908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s or protein is eaten and [[digestion|digested]], [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]], another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both [[glycogenolysis]] (the breakdown of glycogen) and [[gluconeogenesis]] (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/bb450/summer09/lecture/glycogennotes.html|title=Glycogen Biosynthesis; Glycogen Breakdown|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called "''la matière glycogène''", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–37 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5033.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:

[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]

In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the α(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}
Long-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason = http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html
References fuel utilization at lower intensity levels of endurance training|date = August 2013}} sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. ''The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and the Practitioner. ''Lyle McDonald, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Costill DL et. al. Muscle glycogen utilization during prolonged exercise on successive days. J Appl Physiol (1971) 31: 834–38."&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as [[carbohydrate loading]]. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Glycogen depletion and increased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in muscle after exerciseAm J Physiol Endocrinol MetabDecember 1, 1986&amp;nbsp;251:(6) E664–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle.

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.

When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and [[caffeine]] following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pedersen DJ, Lessard SJ, Coffey VG, etal |title=High rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis after exhaustive exercise when carbohydrate is coingested with caffeine |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18467543 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007 |type=Original article }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gaudet | first1=Laura | last2=Jackson | first2=Allen | last3=Streitz | first3=Carmyn | last4=McIntire | first4=Kyle | last5=McDaniel | first5=Larry | title=The Effects Of Caffeine On Athletic Performance | url=http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/CTMS/article/view/5518 | publisher=Clute Institute | accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beelen M, Burke LM, Gibala MJ, van Loon L JC | title = Nutritional strategies to promote postexercise recovery | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–32 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21116024 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515 | url = http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/pdf/10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a [[clinically significant]] effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review" /&gt;

The '''ground tissue''' of plants includes all tissues that are neither [[Epidermis (botany)|dermal]] nor [[Vascular tissue|vascular]]. It can be divided into three types based on the nature of the cell walls.

# '''Parenchyma''' cells have thin [[primary wall]]s and usually remain alive after they become mature. Parenchyma forms the "filler" tissue in the soft parts of plants, and is usually present in [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], [[pericycle]], [[pith]], and [[Medullary ray (botany)|medullary rays]] in primary [[Plant stem|stem]] and [[root]].
# '''Collenchyma''' cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening. Collenchyma provides extra mechanical and structural support, particularly in regions of new growth.
# '''Sclerenchyma''' cells have thick [[Lignin|lignified]] [[Secondary cell wall|secondary walls]] and often die when mature. Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp=98–103}}

==Parenchyma==
[[Parenchyma]] ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|ɹ|ɛ|ŋ|k|ᵻ|m|ə}};{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|Parenchyma}}}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|Parenchyma}}}} from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παρέγχυμα ''parenkhyma'', "visceral flesh" from παρεγχεῖν ''parenkhein'', "to pour in" from παρα- ''para-'', "beside", ἐν ''en-'', "in" and χεῖν ''khein'', "to pour")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Priscilla |last1=LeMone |first2=Karen |last2=Burke |first3=Trudy |last3=Dwyer |first4=Tracy |last4=Levett-Jones |first5=Lorna |last5=Moxham |first6=Kerry |last6=Reid-Searl |first7=Kamaree |last7=Berry |first8=Keryln |last8=Carville |first9=Majella |last9=Hales |first10=Nicole |last10=Knox |first11=Yoni |last11=Luxford |first12=Debra |last12=Raymond |year=2013 |chapter=Parenchyma |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDXiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA48 |page=G–18 |title=Medical-Surgical Nursing |publisher=Pearson Australia |isbn=978-1-4860-1440-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a versatile ground tissue that generally constitutes the "filler" tissue in soft parts of plants. It forms, among other things, the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[pith]] of stems, the cortex of roots, the [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]] of leaves, the pulp of fruits, and the [[endosperm]] of [[seeds]]. Parenchyma cells are living cells and may remain [[meristematic]] at maturity—meaning that they are capable of [[cell division]] if stimulated. They have thin and flexible [[cellulose]] [[cell wall]]s, and are generally [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] when close-packed, but can be roughly spherical when isolated from their neighbours. They have large [[central vacuole]]s, which allow the cells to store and regulate [[ions]], waste products, and [[water]]. Tissue specialised for food storage is commonly formed of parenchyma cells.

{{Plain image with caption|Plant cell types.svg|Cross section of a leaf showing various ground tissue types|600px|right}}

Parenchyma cells have a variety of functions:
* Their main function is to repair.
* In [[leaf|leaves]], they form the [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]] and are responsible for [[photosynthesis]] and the exchange of gases,&lt;ref name="Leaves"&gt;[http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/anatomy/leaves.htm Leaves&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; parenchyma cells in the [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]] of leaves are specialised parenchyma cells called chlorenchyma cells (parenchyma cells with chloroplasts). 
* Storage of starch, protein, fats, oils and water in roots, tubers (e.g. [[potatoes]]), seed [[endosperm]] (e.g. [[cereal]]s) and [[cotyledon]]s (e.g. [[pulses]] and [[peanut]]s) 
* [[Secretion]] (e.g. the parenchyma cells lining the inside of resin ducts)
* Wound repair and the potential for renewed [[meristematic]] activity
* Other specialised functions such as [[aeration]] ([[aerenchyma]]) provides buoyancy and helps aquatic plants in floating.
* Chlorenchyma cells carry out photosynthesis and manufacture food.

The shape of parenchyma cells varies with their function. In the spongy [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]] of a leaf, parenchyma cells range from near-spherical and loosely arranged with large intercellular spaces,&lt;ref name="Leaves" /&gt; to branched or [[Stellate cell|stellate]], mutually interconnected with their neighbours at the ends of their arms to form a three-dimensional network, like in the red kidney bean ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'' and other [[mesophyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Jeffree etal."&gt;Jeffree CE, Read N, Smith JAC and Dale JE (1987). Water droplets and ice deposits in leaf intercellular spaces: redistribution of water during cryofixation for scanning electron microscopy. Planta 172, 20-37&lt;/ref&gt; These cells, along with the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal]] [[guard cell]]s of the [[stoma]], form a system of air spaces and chambers that regulate the exchange of gases. In some works the cells of the leaf epidermis are regarded as specialised parenchymal cells,&lt;ref name= "HOPG"&gt;Hill, J. Ben; Overholts, Lee O; Popp, Henry W. Grove Jr., Alvin R. Botany. A textbook for colleges. Publisher: MacGraw-Hill 1960{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the modern preference has long been to classify the epidermis as [[Epidermis (botany)|plant dermal tissue]], and parenchyma as ground tissue.&lt;ref name="RayEic"&gt;Evert, Ray F; Eichhorn, Susan E.

Shapes of parenchyma:
* Polyhedral
* Stellate (found in stem of plants and have well developed air spaces between them)
* Elongated (found in pallisade tissue of leaf)
* Lobed (found in spongy and pallisade mesophyyll tissue of some plants)

==Collenchyma==
[[File:Plant cell type collenchyma.png|thumb|Cross section of collenchyma cells]]
The first use of "collenchyma" ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|ŋ|k|ᵻ|m|ə|,_|k|ɒ|-}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|collenchyma}}}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|collenchyma}}}}) was by [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|Link]] (1837) who used it to describe the sticky substance on ''[[Bletia]]'' (Orchidaceae) pollen. Complaining about Link's excessive nomenclature, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] (1839) stated mockingly that the term "collenchyma" could have more easily been used to describe elongated sub-epidermal cells with unevenly thickened cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux O. 2012. Collenchyma: a versatile mechanical tissue with dynamic cell walls. Annals of Botany 110 (6): 1083-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collenchyma tissue is composed of elongated cells with irregularly thickened [[cell wall|walls]]. They provide structural support, particularly in growing [[shoot]]s and [[leaf|leaves]]. Collenchyma tissue makes up things such as the resilient strands in stalks of [[celery]]. Collenchyma cells are usually living, and have only a thick [[primary cell wall]]&lt;ref name=Biology.&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology|last=Campbell|first=Neil A.|authorlink=Neil A. Campbell|last2=Reece|first2=Jane B.|authorlink2=Jane Reece|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=978-0-321-54325-7|pages=744–745|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of cellulose and pectin. Cell wall thickness is strongly affected by mechanical stress upon the plant. The walls of collenchyma in shaken plants (to mimic the effects of wind etc.), may be 40–100% thicker than those not shaken.

There are four main types of collenchyma:
* Angular collenchyma (thickened at intercellular contact points)
* Tangential collenchyma (cells arranged into ordered rows and thickened at the tangential face of the cell wall)
* Annular collenchyma (uniformly thickened cell walls)
* Lacunar collenchyma (collenchyma with intercellular spaces)

Collenchyma cells are most often found adjacent to outer growing tissues such as the [[vascular cambium]] and are known for increasing structural support and integrity.

==Sclerenchyma==
The term "sclerenchyma" (originally ''Sclerenchyma'') was introduced by [[Mettenius]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Mettenius, G. 1865. Über die Hymenophyllaceae. ''Abhandlungen der Mathematisch-Physischen Klasse der Königlich-Sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften'' 11: 403-504, pl. 1-5. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzIWAAAAYAAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sclerenchyma is the tissue which makes the plant hard and stiff. Sclerenchyma is the supporting tissue in [[plant]]s. Two types of sclerenchyma cells exist: fibers and [[sclereid]]s. Their [[cell wall]]s consist of [[cellulose]], hemicellulose and [[lignin]]. Sclerenchyma cells are the principal supporting cells in plant tissues that have ceased elongation. Sclerenchyma fibers are of great economic importance, since they constitute the source material for many fabrics (e.g. [flax])  [[hemp]], [[jute]], and [[ramie]]).

Unlike the collenchyma, mature sclerenchyma is composed of dead cells with extremely thick cell walls ([[Secondary cell wall|secondary walls]]) that make up to 90% of the whole cell volume. The term ''sclerenchyma'' is derived from the Greek σκληρός (''sklērós''), meaning "hard." It is the hard, thick walls that make sclerenchyma cells important strengthening and supporting elements in plant parts that have ceased elongation. The difference between fibers and sclereids is not always clear: transitions do exist, sometimes even within the same plant.


[[File:Plant cell type sclerenchyma fibers.png|thumb|Cross section of sclerenchyma fibers]]
Fibers or [[bast (biology)|bast]] are generally long, slender, so-called prosenchymatous cells, usually occurring in strands or bundles. Such bundles or the totality of a stem's bundles are colloquially called fibers. Their high load-bearing capacity and the ease with which they can be processed has since antiquity made them the source material for a number of things, like [[rope]]s, [[Textile|fabrics]] and [[mattress]]es. The fibers of [[flax]] (''Linum usitatissimum'') have been known in [[Europe]] and [[Egypt]] for more than 3,000 years, those of [[hemp]] (''Cannabis sativa'') in [[China]] for just as long. These fibers, and those of [[jute]] (''Corchorus capsularis'') and [[ramie]] (''Boehmeria nivea'', a [[Urticaceae|nettle]]), are extremely soft and elastic and are especially well suited for the processing to [[textile]]s. Their principal cell wall material is [[cellulose]].

Contrasting are hard fibers that are mostly found in [[monocot]]s. Typical examples are the fiber of many [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[agave]]s ([[sisal]]: ''Agave sisalana''), [[lily|lilies]] (''Yucca'' or ''Phormium tenax''), ''Musa textilis'' and others. Their cell walls contain, besides cellulose, a high proportion of [[lignin]]. The load-bearing capacity of ''[[phormium|Phormium tenax]]'' is as high as 20–25&amp;nbsp;kg/mm², the same as that of good [[steel]] wire (25&amp;nbsp;kg/ mm²), but the fibre tears as soon as too great a strain is placed upon it, while the wire distorts and does not tear before a strain of 80&amp;nbsp;kg/mm². The thickening of a cell wall has been studied in ''[[Linum]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Starting at the centre of the fiber, the thickening layers of the secondary wall are deposited one after the other. Growth at both tips of the cell leads to simultaneous elongation. During development the layers of secondary material seem like tubes, of which the outer one is always longer and older than the next. After completion of growth, the missing parts are supplemented, so that the wall is evenly thickened up to the tips of the fibers.

Fibers usually originate from [[meristematic]] tissues. [[Cambium (botany)|Cambium]] and [[procambium]] are their main centers of production. They are usually associated with the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] of the vascular bundles. The fibers of the xylem are always [[lignified]], while those of the phloem are [[cellulosic]]. Reliable evidence for the fibre cells' evolutionary origin from [[tracheid]]s exists.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} During evolution the strength of the tracheid cell walls was enhanced, the ability to conduct water was lost and the size of the pits was reduced. Fibers that do not belong to the xylem are bast (outside the ring of cambium) and such fibers that are arranged in characteristic patterns at different sites of the shoot.

===Sclereids===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|Sclereid}}
[[File:Plant cell type sclerenchyma sclereid.png|thumb|Fresh mount of a sclereid]]
[[File:Dionysia kossinskyi sclereids.TIF|thumb|right|Long, tapered sclereids supporting a leaf edge in ''Dionysia kossinskyi'']]
Sclereids are the reduced form of sclerenchyma cells with highly thickened, lignified walls. These have a shape of a star.

They are small bundles of sclerenchyma tissue in [[plant]]s that form durable layers, such as the cores of [[apple]]s and the gritty texture of [[pear]]s (''Pyrus communis''). Sclereids are variable in shape. The cells can be isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within [[parenchyma]] tissues. But compared with most fibres, sclereids are relatively short. Characteristic examples are [[brachysclereid]]s or the [[stone cell]]s (called stone cells because of their hardness) of pears and [[quince]]s (''Cydonia oblonga'') and those of the shoot of the [[Hoya carnosa|wax plant]] (''Hoya carnosa''). The cell walls fill nearly all the cell's volume. A layering of the walls and the existence of branched pits is clearly visible. Branched pits such as these are called ramiform pits. The shell of many seeds like those of nuts as well as the stones of [[drupe]]s like [[cherry|cherries]] and [[plum]]s are made up from sclereids.

These structures are used to protect other cells.

[[File:IFO institute.JPG|thumb|350px|The main building of the Ifo institute in Munich. Address: Poschinger Straße 5.]]
The '''Ifo Institute for Economic Research''' is a [[Munich]]-based research institution. Ifo is an acronym from '''I'''nformation and '''Fo'''rschung (research). As one of Germany's largest economic think-tanks, it analyses economic policy and is widely known for its monthly [[Ifo Business Climate Index]] for Germany. Its research output is significant: about a quarter of the articles published by German research institutes in international journals in economics in 2006 were from Ifo researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsblatt: ''[https://www.handelsblatt.com/news/Default.aspx?_p=302030&amp;_t=ft&amp;_b=1291044 Forschungsleistung der Institute: Ifo hat die Nase deutlich vorn]'', 9. Juli 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] ranking, it is also Germany's most influential economics research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bernau: ''[http://blogs.faz.net/fazit/2017/11/01/muenchener-institut-und-universitaet-sind-einflussreich-9342/ Münchener Institut und Universität sind einflussreich]'', FAZ Fazit, 1 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
According to its by-laws, the aim of the Ifo Institute is to conduct empirical research in the fields of economics and social science, and to supply data, information and research results in economics and economic policy. The results of Ifo’s work are made accessible to the general public and should – according to Ifo’s by-laws – support decision-making in academia, business, politics and administration.

* Supplying the public with economic data. The Institute organizes seminars and presentations by and for its own researchers and other economists. The well-known Ifo Business Climate Index is Ifo’s most prominent instrument for business cycle analyses. With its DICE database the Ifo Institute offers cross-country comparisons of systematic information on institutions and regulations. The Institute also publishes a number of journals in economics.
* Generating its own data (e.g. Ifo Business Climate Index) via its corporate surveys.
* Providing policy advice to influential public agencies, especially to federal and state ministries in Germany.
* Developing models to simulate the effects of market intervention in the economy.
* Research in economics. : Ifo’s research prior to 1999 was heavily geared towards its advisory function. Following the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Council a stronger university orientation was followed as of 1999. As a research organisation the Ifo Institute cooperates closely with many German universities, especially with the [[University of Munich]] (LMU), as well as with numerous domestic and foreign research institutes.
* The Institute has a branch in Dresden, which focuses on analysis of economic developments in Saxony and the other new states.

== Structure ==
The Ifo Institute is a registered society with the sole purpose of non-profit, economic and social research. Its by-laws constitute the legal foundation of the society. Ifo’s main organs are the Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board, the Ifo Administrative Council, the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Advisory Council. The Chairman of the Executive Board is also described in the by-laws as the Institute’s President. Alongside the President, the Executive Board may also have one to two further members. The Administrative Council supervises the Executive Board. It consists of two members from the Board of Trustees, two members from the University of Munich, a federal government representative, a Bavarian State government representative, the Chairman of the Scientific Administrative Council and further members who are elected by the Annual General Meeting. The aim of the Board of Trustees, as stated in the by-laws, is to support the Executive Board in fulfilling the society’s aims. According to Ifo’s by-laws, the Board of Trustees should have, “at least 20 members from academia, business, politics, trade unions and administration”.

Around two thirds of the Ifo Institute’s financing currently comes from public funds (in the form of joint research funding from the government and the Länder via the [[Leibniz Association]]), while around one third comes from the proceeds of third-party funded projects, which are mainly commissioned by public sector clients (“scientific policy advisory work”). Research for the private sector is relatively insignificant

The Ifo Institute is an institute “at the University of Munich”, which reflects its close links with the university.

The Dresden branch of Ifo is mainly financed by grants from the Free State of Saxony (as well as by a small amount of third-party funds).

== Staff ==
The Ifo Institute currently employs about 193 people, approximately half of whom are researchers.  The current Ifo president is [[Clemens Fuest]].

== History ==
The Ifo Institute was founded in 1949 as the '''I'''nformations- und '''Fo'''rschungsstelle (Ifo – Information and Research branch) für Wirtschaftsbeobachtung (for economic monitoring) with funds from the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior. In 1993 the Ifo Institute opened a branch in Dresden to analyse the economic integration of both parts of reunified Germany. Under the presidency of Hans-Werner Sinn, Ifo became an Institute “at” the University of Munich [[University of Munich]] (LMU), which was reflected in its expanded name (which was changed to "Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich") and its close cooperation with the [[Center for Economic Studies]] (CES), also headed by Sinn.

== Departments ==
* Business Cycle Analyses and Surveys
* Public Finance
* Social Policy and Labour Markets
* Human Capital and Innovation
* Industrial Organisation and New Technologies
* Energy, Environment and Exhaustible Resources
* International Trade
* International Institutional Comparisons

==Report on the German economy==
The '''Ifo Institute''' participates in the twice yearly (spring and autumn) joint analysis of the state of the German and world economy, the so-called ''Gemeinschaftsdiagnose''. &lt;ref&gt;German government Web site [https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2017/20170412-zypries-gemeinschaftsdiagnose-stellt-deutscher-wirtschaft-gutes-zeugnis-aus.html Bundeswirtschaftsministerium Online {{De icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The other institutes are:
[[Institut für Weltwirtschaft]] (IfW) in [[Kiel]]; [[Halle Institute for Economic Research|Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung]] (IWH) in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]; and [[Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung]] (RWI) in [[Essen]].

== Evaluation ==
At its meeting of 2 November 2009 the Joint Science Conference (GWK - Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz) of the German federal and state governments decided to re-classify and fund the Ifo Institute as a “primarily research institution”. For over a decade prior to this point the Ifo Institute was jointly funded by the federal government and the Länder as an “institution that primarily conducts scientific infrastructure tasks” (as a service institution). In taking this decision, the GWK followed the recommendation of the Leibniz Association Senate of 4 March 2009.

After an extensive evaluation by an international commission of experts in 2006, the Senate of the Leibniz Association had already acknowledged that the Ifo Institute showed: “good, and in some areas very good to excellent achievements in economics research and policy advisory work”. This positive assessment was qualified by the Senate’s criticism of Ifo’s services, which were partly described as: “not corresponding to the latest research, especially with regard to their methodological foundations”.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz Gemeinschaft Referat Evaluierung (Hrsg.): "Leibniz-Senat verabschiedet positive Förderempfehlungen zu fünf Leibniz-Einrichtungen", Pressemitteilung E8/2006 vom 15. Juni 2006, als PDF-Datei aufzurufen auf der WGL-Seite [http://www.wgl.de/?nid=pmeva&amp;nidap= Pressemitteilungen]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 the Senate came to the conclusion that the Ifo Institute had addressed these shortcomings.

In its 2006 report the evaluation commission also described CESifo GmbH, the joint subsidiary of the LMU and the Ifo Institute, as a “great institution for knowledge transfer and international cooperation.”

== Publications ==
According to a study cited by the ''Handelsblatt'', the Ifo Institute was the economics think-tank with the highest number of publications in Germany in 2006. In the ''Handelsblatt'' ranking of economists under the age of 40 years, Ifo ranked top among all of the economics institutes and faculties in German-speaking countries in 2011. In the RePEc ranking of research performance, disregarding age, the Ifo Institute ranked third among Germany’s economics research institutes and faculties.

==Overview==
The original idea of the ''Illustris project'' has been proposed by Mark Vogelsberger as the first large-scale galaxy formation application of Volker Springel's novel Arepo code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Sijacki|first2=Debora|last3=Kereš|first3=Dušan|last4=Springel|first4=Volker|last5=Hernquist|first5=Lars|date=2012-09-05|title=Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/4/3024/1079965|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=425|issue=4|pages=3024–3057|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21590.x|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Sijacki|first2=Debora|last3=Kereš|first3=Dušan|last4=Springel|first4=Volker|last5=Hernquist|first5=Lars|date=2012-09-05|title=Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/4/3024/1079965|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=425|issue=4|pages=3024–3057|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21590.x|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Illustris Project contains a series simulations, with the IllustrisTNG series being the most recent one. 

The ''Illustris project'' includes [[Cosmic web|large-scale]] [[Cosmology|cosmological]] [[simulations]] of the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]], spanning initial conditions of the [[Big Bang]], to the present day, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years]] later. Modeling, based on the most precise data and calculations currently available, are compared to actual findings of the [[observable universe]] in order to better understand the nature of the [[universe]], including [[galaxy formation]], [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="HS-20140507" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140716" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140512" /&gt;

The simulation includes many physical processes which are thought to be critical for galaxy formation. These include the formation of stars and the subsequent "feedback" due to supernova explosions, as well as the formation of super-massive black holes, their consumption of nearby gas, and their multiple modes of energetic feedback.&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20140508" /&gt;

Images, videos, and other data visualizations for public distribution are available at [http://www.illustris-project.org/media/ official media page]. All original data files can be directly downloaded through the [http://www.illustris-project.org/data/ data release webpage]

===Computational aspects===
The main ''Illustris'' simulation was run on the [[Curie supercomputer]] at [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|CEA (France)]] and the [[SuperMUC|SuperMUC supercomputer]] at the [[Dagstuhl|Leibniz Computing Center (Germany)]].&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRD-20140507"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Adam |title=Supercomputers Simulate the Universe in Unprecedented Detail |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/supercomputers-simulate-the-universe-in-unprecedented-detail/ |date=7 May 2014 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=18 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 19 million CPU hours was required, using 8,192 [[Central processing unit|CPU cores]].&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt; The peak memory usage was approximately 25 TB of RAM.&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt; A total of 136 snapshots were saved over the course of the simulation, totaling over 230 TB cumulative data volume.&lt;ref name="ARX-20140514" /&gt;

A code called "Arepo" was used to run the Illustris simulations. It was written by Volker Springel, the same author as the [[GADGET]] code. The name is derived from the [[Sator Square]]. This code solves the coupled equations of [[gravity]] and [[hydrodynamics]] using a [[discretization]] of space based on a moving [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi tessellation]]. It is optimized for running on large, distributed memory supercomputers using a [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] approach. The core galaxy formation model of Illustris and IllustrisTNG has been developed by Mark Vogelsberger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Genel|first2=Shy|last3=Sijacki|first3=Debora|last4=Torrey|first4=Paul|last5=Springel|first5=Volker|last6=Hernquist|first6=Lars|date=2013-10-23|title=A model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation physics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/436/4/3031/984888|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=436|issue=4|pages=3031–3067|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1789|issn=1365-2966}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Public data release===
In April, 2015 (eleven months after the first papers were published) the project team publicly released all data products from all simulations.&lt;ref name="ARX-150400362"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nelson, D. |author2=Pillepich, A. |author3=Genel, S. |author4=Vogelsberger, M. |author5=Springel, V. |author6=Torrey, P. |author7=Rodriguez-Gomez, V. |author8=Sijacki, D. |author9=Snyder, G.

This includes group catalogs of individual halos and subhalos, merger trees tracking these objects through time, full snapshot particle data at 135 distinct time points, and various supplementary data catalogs. In addition to direct data download, a web-based API allows for many common search and [[data extraction]] tasks to be completed without needing access to the full data sets.

==IllustrisTNG==
As a followup effort to Illustris, the [http://www.tng-project.org/ IllustrisTNG project] ("the next generation") was first presented in July, 2017. First, a new physical model was developed, which among other features now includes [[Magnetohydrodynamics]]. Three simulations are planned, which are different volumes at different resolutions. The intermediate simulation (TNG100) is equivalent to the original Illustris simulation.

'''Kinematic determinacy''' is a term used in [[structural mechanics]] to describe a structure where material compatibility conditions alone can be used to calculate deflections.

A kinematically determinate structure can be defined as a structure where, if it is possible to find nodal displacements compatible with member extensions, those nodal displacements are unique. The structure has no possible mechanisms, i.e. nodal displacements, compatible with zero member extensions, at least to a first-order approximation. Mathematically, the [[mass matrix]] of the structure must have full rank.

Kinematic determinacy can be loosely used to classify an arrangement of structural members as a ''structure'' (stable) instead of a ''mechanism'' (unstable).

The principles of kinematic determinacy are used to design precision devices such as [[mirror mount]]s for optics, and precision [[linear motion bearing]]s.

Within 8 h, 50% to 78% of the As taken up is distributed to the fronds, which take from 1.3 to 6.7 times more As than the roots do. No P for 8 days increases the arsenate's maximum net influx by 2.5-fold; the plants then absorbs 10 times more arsenate than arsenite. If on the other hand the P supply is increased, As uptake decreases - with a greater effect on the roots than on the shoots. More arsenate decreases the P concentration in the roots, but not in the fronds. P in the uptake solution markedly decreases arsenate uptake. The presence or absence of P does not affect the uptake of arsenite, which translocates more easily than arsenate.&lt;/ref&gt; || ''[[Pteris vittata]]'' L. || Ladder brake fern or Chinese brake fern || 26% of As in the soil removed after 20 weeks' plantation, about 90% As accumulated in fronds.&lt;ref name="Tu05"&gt;

{{chemical engineering}}
'''Mass transfer''' is the net movement of mass from one location, usually meaning  stream, phase, fraction or component, to another. Mass transfer occurs in many processes, such as [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[evaporation]], [[drying]], [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane filtration]], and [[distillation]]. Mass transfer is used by different scientific disciplines for different processes and mechanisms. The phrase is commonly used in [[engineering]] for physical processes that involve [[molecular diffusion|diffusive]] and [[convection|convective]] transport of [[chemical species]] within [[system|physical systems]].

Some common examples of mass transfer processes are the [[evaporation]] of [[water]] from a pond to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the purification of blood in the [[kidney]]s and [[liver]], and the distillation of alcohol. In industrial processes, mass transfer operations include separation of chemical components in distillation columns, absorbers such as scrubbers or stripping, adsorbers such as activated carbon beds, and [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. Mass transfer is often coupled to additional [[transport phenomena|transport processes]], for instance in industrial [[cooling tower]]s. These towers couple heat transfer to mass transfer by allowing hot water to flow in contact with air. The water is cooled by expelling some of its content in the form of water vapour.

==Astrophysics==

In [[astrophysics]], mass transfer is the process by which [[matter]] [[gravitation]]ally bound to a body, usually a [[star]], fills its [[Roche lobe]] and becomes gravitationally bound to a second body, usually a compact object ([[white dwarf]], [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]), and is eventually accreted onto it. It is a common phenomenon in [[binary star|binary systems]], and may play an important role in some types of [[supernova]]e and [[pulsar]]s.

==Chemical engineering==

Mass transfer finds extensive application in [[chemical engineering]] problems. It is used in reaction engineering, separations engineering, heat transfer engineering, and many other sub-disciplines of chemical engineering like electrochemical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 100 (2013) 78-84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2013.03.134&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving force for mass transfer is usually a difference in [[chemical potential]], when it can be defined, though other [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic gradients]] may couple to the flow of mass and drive it as well. A chemical species moves from areas of high chemical potential to areas of low chemical potential. Thus, the maximum theoretical extent of a given mass transfer is typically determined by the point at which the chemical potential is uniform. For single phase-systems, this usually translates to uniform concentration throughout the phase, while for multiphase systems chemical species will often prefer one phase over the others and reach a uniform chemical potential only when most of the chemical species has been absorbed into the preferred phase, as in [[liquid-liquid extraction]].

While thermodynamic equilibrium determines the theoretical extent of a given mass transfer operation, the actual rate of mass transfer will depend on additional factors including the flow patterns within the system and the [[mass diffusivity|diffusivities]] of the species in each phase. This rate can be quantified through the calculation and application of [[mass transfer coefficient]]s for an overall process. These mass transfer coefficients are typically published in terms of [[dimensionless quantities|dimensionless numbers]], often including [[Péclet number]]s, [[Reynolds number]]s, [[Sherwood number]]s and [[Schmidt number]]s, among others.&lt;ref name="basictext"&gt;{{cite book

==Analogies between heat, mass, and momentum transfer==
{{main|Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)|l1=Transport phenomena}}
There are notable similarities in the commonly used approximate differential equations for momentum, heat, and mass transfer.&lt;ref name="basictext"/&gt; The molecular transfer equations of [[Newtonian fluid|Newton's law]] for fluid momentum at low [[Reynolds number]] ([[Stokes flow]]), [[Heat conduction|Fourier's law]] for heat, and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's law]] for mass are very similar, since they are all [[linear approximation]]s to transport of conserved quantities in a flow field. 
At higher Reynolds number, the analogy between mass and heat transfer and momentum transfer becomes less useful due to the [[nonlinearity]] of the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] (or more fundamentally, the [[Momentum#Relating to force – general equations of motion|general momentum conservation equation]]), but the analogy between heat and mass transfer remains good. A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing analogies among these three transport processes so as to allow prediction of one from any of the others.

The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) has a number of programs aimed at '''Mission blue butterfly habitat conservation''', which include lands traditionally inhabited by the [[Mission blue butterfly]], an [[endangered species]]. A recovery plan, drawn up by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants.&lt;ref name="Biogeo"&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/bholzman/courses/Fall00Projects/MissionBlue.htm The Biogeography of the Mission Blue Butterfly (''Icaricia icarioides missionensis'')], San Francisco State University, Department of Geography, Autumn 2000&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen agencies can be found at the Marin Headlands in the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities as well as damaging existing ones.

==Marin Headlands==
{{see also|Marin Headlands}}
[[Image:Marin headlands 6-9-05.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The Marin Headlands from Immigrant Point Overlook]]
The program at the Marin Headlands for Mission blue butterfly habitat protection aims to deal with one of the main problems facing the Mission blue butterfly population. The Headlands area was once owned by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. From 1870 on, the Army used the area for forts such as [[Fort Cronkhite]], coastal batteries such as those that protected the [[San Francisco Bay]] during WW II, and missile sites, such as the 280 that occupied the area during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, Marta. [http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/article.cfm?archiveDate=01-03-05&amp;storyID=20443 Marin Headlands Whispers Stories of Bygone Days By], Berkeley Daily Planet, Jan. 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Marin Headlands, the Army planted a lot of trees, so many that today the non-native, [[invasive species]] that occupy the Headlands threaten the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. The habitat protection program seeks to root out these species from selected areas of the Marin Headlands. Some of the species that have now become native to the area and threaten the habitat of the endangered Mission blue butterfly include [[Eucalyptus globulus|blue gum eucalyptus]], [[Monterey cypress]], [[Monterey pine]] and [[Acacia melanoxylon|blackwood acacia]]. The Mission Blue Butterfly UserFee Project in the headlands will try to remove these species and [[Revegetation|revegetate]] the area with native coastal prairie plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/goga/admin/feedemo/projects/project_missionblue.htm Mission blue butterfly habitat protection], Golden Gate National Recreation Area, National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Bruno Mountain==
{{see also|San Bruno Mountain}}
[[Image:Fog San Bruno Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fog coming off of [[San Bruno Mountain]]]]
Another major conservation effort is underway at San Bruno Mountain. A large area of Mission blue butterfly habitat has been protected under the auspices of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]. In all, the San Bruno Mountain habitat conservation program has protected over {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of habitat since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.Species_HCP Habitat conservation plans], Mission Blue Butterfly, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; San Bruno Mountain was the site of the nation's first [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] (HCP), intended to protect the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. However HCPs remain controversial.

The controversy over HCPs lie in their implementation. The San Bruno HCP came about in 1982. By that year local residents had created [[San Bruno Mountain State Park|San Bruno Mountain State and County Park]], which held {{convert|1950|acre|km2}} of the 3,600 on the mountain, in order to protect the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. Then, the butterfly began to turn up on private land. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formed a committee with landowners, developers, local governments, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]], and others to craft the first HCP in 1982 "to address problems caused by the presence of endangered butterflies on San Bruno Mountain." HCPs do not include any independent scientific review, thus none exists. The plan became the model for the 1983 amendment to the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref name="HCP"&gt;[http://www.coastalconservancy.ca.gov/coast&amp;ocean/spring2001/pages/thre.htm The first ever HCP], ''California Coast &amp; Ocean'', Spring 2001, California Coastal Conservancy&lt;/ref&gt;

HCPs work like this. In exchange for permission to build over the top of the prime habitat of two California endangered butterflies, the Mission blue and the [[San Bruno elfin butterfly]], landowners agreed to measures to improve the prospects for the species' survival in other locations. This particular HCP allowed the development of {{convert|368|acre|km2}} to {{convert|828|acre|km2}}. Property owners who located in this area were required to offer land and funds to conserve and improve habitat in other locales around San Bruno Mountain. Property holders are also assessed for a Habitat Conservation Trust Fund which pays for species monitoring, alien plant removal and other tasks on the "donated" land slated for habitat. One such area on San Bruno Mountain was along the northeast ridge. There, a residential community was built over prime Mission blue habitat, a habitat that was supposed to be restored on the saddle of the mountain. However, the mountain's saddle is colder, damper and windier. On top of this, the saddle is overgrown with an invasive species, gorse, while the Mission blue requires lupine as its host plant.&lt;ref name="HCP"/&gt;

The environmental consulting firm, [[Thomas Reid Associates]] (TRA) crafted the plan and work to carry out the HCPs biological program and monitors the results. In addition, they have conducted the biological studies and environmental impact studies required under the HCP. TRA works with others to stop exotic plant invasions on butterfly habitat and began to undertake the daunting task of replacing the gorse infested saddle with lupine for the butterflies to relocate to. The project started in 1985. [[Gorse]] is a hardy plant that can reach heights of {{convert|20|ft|m}} with deep root systems. TRA tried multiple methods to destroy the invasive species, including herbicides and burning. By April the unfazed gorse bloomed a bright yellow. In 2001, 16 years after the project began, {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of 330 original-acres remained covered in gorse.&lt;ref name="HCP"/&gt;
[[Image:San Bruno mountain distance.jpg|thumb|right|200px|San Bruno Mountain, viewed from San Francisco's [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]] to the north, with the Sunnyside, Balboa Park, Excelsior and Crocker Amazon neighborhoods in the foreground.]]

The Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office is in charge of the plats under conservation at San Bruno Mountain and Parkside Homes. Parkside Homes is the newest habitat conservation plan or agreement and involves a twenty-five acre residential community in South San Francisco. The area is home to non-native and native species which include lupines, [[sedum]], and [[viola]]. The permit was issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=89&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 Parkside Homes], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The original conservation permit for San Bruno Mountain was issued in 1983 and encompassed {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of mixed use land in San Mateo County. The Mission blue is among other endangered species in the 1983 parcel of land. Other animals include the [[San Bruno elfin butterfly]], and the [[San Francisco garter snake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=57&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 San Bruno Mountain Amendment #1 (South Slope)], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1985, another {{convert|203|acre|km2}} of land came under the auspices of the Sacramento office. The area, known as "South Slope" is another mixed use area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=56&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 San Bruno Mountain], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; Three other amendments to the San Bruno Mountain conservation agreement added 10, 19, and {{convert|227|acre|km2}} in 1985, 1986 and 1990, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.Species_HCPMission Blue Butterfly], Habitat Conservation Plans, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Baker==
{{see also|Fort Baker}}
[[Image:Fort baker golden gate.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Abandoned buildings at [[Fort Baker]] are dwarfed by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].]]
Fort Baker is an abandoned base formerly occupied by the U.S. Army. It is near the city of [[Sausalito, California]]. The military announced the post's closure in 1995. By 2001, it had been ceded to the National Park Service.

An {{convert|8+1/4|acre|ha}} area of non-native Monterey pine and tea trees are invading part of a habitat at Fort Baker. The Fort Baker area is a "top vegetation and wildlife management priority" for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. As part of the mission to protect Mission blue habitat the project will seek to physically remove and/or contain those species in areas within or adjacent to the "host plant" ''[[Lupinus albifrons]]''. Upon completion, the area will be completely invasive-tree free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/pore/science_catalog_restore.htm#project7 Fort Baker Mission Blue Butterfly Habitat Restoration], Point Reyes Nat'l Seashore, Catalog of Future Research Opportunities in Bay Area National Parks&lt;/ref&gt;

A pitched legal battle was waged for years over the fate of some of the Fort Baker lands, the players: the city of Sausalito, California, and the National Park Service (NPS). Sausalito and the National Park Service go back in legal battles several years but they also work together at times, sometimes to the benefit of one party or the other, as U.S. Department of Interior appropriations will reveal. In 1999, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY 1999 made a "general provisions" dealing with the city of Sausalito and the Department of Interior. Basically stating that the NPS owned land at Fort Baker was property tax exempt and exempt from any kind of special assessment from the state of California, county of Marin, or city of Sausalito.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp105DxSLh&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr825.105&amp;db_id=105&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_3910374&amp; House Report 105-825], General Provisions-Department of Interior, Library of Congress, THOMAS&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mission blue 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Mission blue butterfly (''I. missionensis'') perched]]
The legal battle ensued when the National Park Service announced plans to finally allow a development group to build a large, long-awaited hotel/conference center complex on the remains of Fort Baker. The NPS first announced their intention to develop Fort Baker in 1980's Golden Gate National Recreation Area General Management Plan which proclaimed that Fort Baker would become a conference center. The group, Fort Baker Retreat Group LLC - is an amalgam of Passport Resorts, a hotel management company; Equity Community Builders, the development manager; and Ajax Capital, a financial partner. Talk about development at the site, managed by the Park Service, first began in earnest in 1998. By 2001, the city of Sausalito had filed suit to force an injunction against the Park Service's plan to go ahead with the project. The suit lingered in court for several years. The essential quarrel was over the size of the project which looked to be approaching the maximum size of 350 rooms as adopted in the June 2000 original Fort Baker Plan.&lt;ref name="Bowa"&gt;Bowa, Carla. [http://www.marinij.com/marin/ci_3490930 History, modernization blend for retreat-conference center], ''Marin Independent Journal'', Feb. 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged, however, that the NPS violated numerous environmental laws during the development of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project. The EIS was completed in 1999 and included the NPS' preferred alternative to the hotel/conference center. The alternative, {{convert|42|acre|m2}} of habitat, 23 specifically for the Mission blue butterfly, to be preserved, improved or repaired.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/SGLC/National/SandBar/3.4sausalito.htm Sausalito Has Standing to Sue to Stop Redevelopment of National Recreation Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913134230/http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/SGLC/National/SandBar/3.4sausalito.htm |date=2006-09-13 }}, National Sea Grant Law Center, University of Mississippi&lt;/ref&gt; Sausalito's 2001 suit also alleged that the EIS was "deficient."

It was not until October 20, 2004 that a judgement was handed down in the case. In ''City of Sausalito v. O'Neill'' the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] said that Sausalito did have standing to sue the NPS for an injunction to halt the hotel project at Fort Baker. The 2004 ruling proclaimed "standing" according to [[Article III of the U.S. Constitution]]. Article III requires that the defendant has suffered an "injury in fact", the injury is fairly traceable and it is likely that the injury will be repaired by a decision in favor of the defendant. The court found that Sausalito had an "injury in fact" because the Fort Baker project could attract up to 2,700 visitors per day, impacting traffic, aesthetic appeal and revenue in Sausalito.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;

The court also found that the city had statutory standing for the [[injunction]] suit as well. That authority came under the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA), and the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] (MMPA). The decision, however, was not a total victory for the city of Sausalito. The court rejected the city's claims under the NPS Organics Act and the [[Concessions Management Improvement Act]] (CMIA) and the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] (MBTA). The court rulings on the other statutory claims are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''ESA''': The law requires consulting the USFWS or [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] if federal activities might result in a taking. The 9th Circuit held that the NPS had consulted with USFWS as well as the NMFS during the evolution of the Fort Baker plan. Furthermore, the court held that the NPS had incorporated mitigation measures as recommended by the NMFS for [[salmonids]] and by the USFWS for the Mission blue butterfly into their final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). They had complied with the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''MMPA''': The MMPA prohibits the taking of endangered or threatened species. The city argued that the National Park Service (NPS) failed to secure appropriate permits for takings as a result of construction activities associated with the Fort Baker plan. Since neither party had fully covered this issue in district court the 9th Circuit remanded the claim for an initial ruling on its merits.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''MBTA''': Under this law it is unlawful to hunt, kill, or capture a [[migratory bird]]. There is an exception to this law and it revolves around habitat destruction. Habitat destruction does not effect a taking under the MBTA. The court ruled that the NPS did not have to seek MBTA authorization. This is because birds will only be distributed through habitat modification.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''CZMA''': The coastal management program for the San Francisco Bay Area, federally approved, allows limited commercial recreational facilities within waterfront parks. They must be incidental to park use and not restrict public access to the bay, however. Both federal and state coastal management plans must be consistent with each other under CZMA. The "Bay Commission" determined that the NPS' Fort Baker plan was consistent with the Bay Plan. The city of Sausalito claimed that the Bay Commission's consistency determination did not satisfy the CZMA. The court concurred with the city on this point. It held that the NPS' consistency determination was based on improper ground, a general insufficient funding claim. The court remanded this claim, under the CZMA, to the district court for further proceedings.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the court rejected Sausalito's claims under the NPS Organic Act, the CMIA and the Omnibus Act the 9th Circuits findings for the city were a victory. Both the MMPA and CZMA claims were remanded back to district court for further inquiry. This helped lead to a settlement the next year.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt; The entire affair was settled in 2005 when the city and the Park Service came to an agreement which resulted in the project being trimmed down to a 144-room hotel complex. The settlement actually capped the room capacity at a higher 225.&lt;ref name="Bowa"/&gt;

==Twin Peaks==
{{see also|Twin Peaks, San Francisco, California}}
[[Image:SF from Twin Peaks.jpg|thumb|left|150px|San Francisco from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]]]]
The Twin Peaks, icons of the San Francisco Bay Area, are also home to a reported population of Mission blue butterflies. The entire area is a park managed by the [[San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department]] (SFRPD). The park contains {{convert|31|acre|m2}} of what the Park Department terms "Natural Areas." This area is most of the park minus roads, viewpoints and the City Fire Department reservoir. The natural areas contain significant resources for preservation. They include some of the largest areas of coastal [[scrubland|scrub]] and [[prairie]] that remains within the city of San Francisco. These, being the preferred habitat of the Mission blue, are areas that support and provide habitat for the butterfly. Twin Peaks receives heavy recreational use because of its picturesque view of the city. Twin Peaks supports a wide array of habitat types, from mixed forest to coastal scrub. Among the coastal scrub and prairies are [[silver bush lupine]] plants (''L. albifrons'') which support the colonies of endangered Mission blues.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"&gt;[http://www.parks.sfgov.org/wcm_recpark/SNRAMP_Final_Draft/6_Site-Specific/68TwinPeaks.pdf Significant Natural Areas Management Plan, Twin Peaks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030752/http://www.parks.sfgov.org/wcm_recpark/SNRAMP_Final_Draft/6_Site-Specific/68TwinPeaks.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department, Feb. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission blue was first reported in Twin Peaks in 1979; since then SFRPD staff confirmed their continued presence in 2000 and 2001. Protocols for monitoring include egg surveys on [[lupin]]e plants at regular time intervals throughout the spring. In 2000, surveys found 56 eggs on 115 plants in the southern part of Twin Peaks. May 2001 surveys reconfirmed the original finding, albeit in smaller numbers. That year 14 eggs were found on 15 silver bush lupine plants.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt; Between 2001 and 2007, SF Parks and Rec found only two adults and two larvae. In April 2009, a [https://www.webcitation.org/5oqhFOd40?url=http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/recpark/missionbluebutterflyFINAL.pdf reintroduction was attempted] with the release of 22 butterflies from the San Bruno population.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mission blue 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Mission blue butterfly]] --&gt;
In February 2006, the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department released its "Significant Natural Resource Areas Management Plan." The plan outlines site specific recommendations for the more than {{convert|800|acre|km2}} in over 30 San Francisco parks designated Significant Natural Resource Areas. The site specific plan for Twin Peaks covers the issue of habitat conservation for the Mission blue. The plan recommends that priority be given to "maintaining the habitat necessary for Mission blue butterflies, especially the host plant (silver bush lupine)." The silver bush lupine is common in and around Twin Peaks. In addition the Management Plan recommended that the Mission blue population at Twin Peaks]The [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]] be monitored and the host plant populations should be augmented whenever possible.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt;

The Mission blue is the only federally endangered animal at Twin Peaks; however, the [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] is a federally threatened species. Aside from these, the park at Twin peaks is home to about 20 other species that are threatened or endangered at a local level.  Most threatened species at Twin Peaks are of local concern only.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt;

== Fire rehabilitation ==
Popular thought is that the host plants, [[lupin]]es, require periodic disturbances in order to successfully reproduce. Many possible natural disturbances are actively worked against by humans, such as fire and landslides because areas are designed with a dual use purpose in mind, often for recreational use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://essig.berkeley.edu/endins/mission.htm Mission Blue Butterfly], Essig Museum of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solstice fire===
[[Image:Solstice fire restoration area.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The area where the Solstice fire occurred is under restoration.]]
In June 2004, the Solstice Fire burned near Sausalito, California. The fire started when an errant "international visitor" had a fire mishap while camping. This fire threatened historical buildings which a public-private partnership planned to turn into a conference center. The building was spared but a stand of non-native [[Monterey pine]]s was not so lucky. The Monterey pine, a pesky invasive species that has become "naturalized," is continually encroaching on the coastal grasslands that the Mission blue butterfly prefers and requires. Over 250 trees were removed from the area after the fire, burnt remnants of what they once were. The charred trees were chipped and the chips utilized in an electric generation facility as well as on site to control [[Delairea odorata|cape ivy]], another invasive species.&lt;ref name="Fireplan"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/06_ca_nps_gogate_hfr.pdf |title=Restoration after Solstice Fire Reduces Fuel and Improves Grassland Health |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area that was cut was seeded with native plants. Among them, [[purple needle grass]], in  fall 2004 and again in fall 2005 about one pound of purple needle grass seed was sowed directly on the burn site. 400 summer lupine seedlings were also planted, most were grown in nearby nurseries while some were collected in the Marin Headlands. Still, both plants are forced to compete with non-native [[Italian thistle]] and [[French broom]].&lt;ref name="Fireplan"/&gt;

===Lateral fire===
[[Image:French broom burn site lateral fire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Invasive [[French broom]] has moved into the area of the Lateral fire burn.]]
The August 2004 "Lateral Fire" started, again, within Fort Baker, a half mile south of Sausalito, California. Besides threatening urban area, and historic buildings the fire threatened the habitat of the Mission blue. The fire happened within a {{convert|17|acre|m2|sing=on}} habitat restoration project and burned areas of the butterfly's host lupine plant, ''Lupinus albifrons''. Mission blues lay their eggs on ''L. albifrons'' each year. The fire burned about 300 plants. The U.S. federal government responded per the [[National Fire Plan]].&lt;ref name="Fireplan2"&gt;[http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/05_CA_NPS-goga-MissionBlue-rehab.pdf Non-native Plant Control After Wildfire Protects Butterfly Habitat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315083818/http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/05_CA_NPS-goga-MissionBlue-rehab.pdf |date=2007-03-15 }} ([[PDF]]), Golden Gate National Recreation Area, National Fire Plan--Rehabilitation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of non-native species trying to reinvade the area was cited as a key measure in protecting the lupines, essential to Mission blue survival. The non-native French broom and Italian thistle were among the culprits seeking to re-enter coastal grass and scrubland. It was French broom which required the most intensive work to prevent reemergence. Three types of treatments were implemented in the effort to control French broom:

*mulching with weed free rice straw
*flaming with handheld [[propane torch]]
*dislodging or cutting with a hula hoe

[[Image:Mission blue 3.JPG|thumb|left|160px|The endangered Mission blue butterfly inhabited the area of the lateral fire.]]
When these techniques were applied to seedlings within two months of [[germination]], they were 90% effective. French broom seed stores were vast and the treatments required multiple applications. A huge new wave of French broom seeds followed three separate flaming treatments and a massive hand pulling of the invasive plant followed up the flame activity. The propane torches proved less successful against Italian thistle which was controlled utilizing mostly a hand pulling and [[herbicide]] combination. In an attempt to rehab the burned areas weed-free straw wattles and weed-free straw mulch to help with erosion control. Following the fire, monitoring was conducted and three findings were considered especially significant. First, about half of the area's lupines survived the fire and an increased number germinated after the fire. Live Mission blue caterpillars were found on a number of burned lupine plants. According to the life cycle of the Mission blue, these eggs would have had to have been laid before the fire. This would indicate that the butterflies, albeit in the early larval stages, survived the Lateral Fire.&lt;ref name="Fireplan2"/&gt;

The '''Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica''' is a [[music museum]] and [[music library]] in the Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, in the historic center of [[Bologna, Italy]].

==Museum==

===Background===
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 to hold the city's collection of musical objects. It was renamed Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica in 2004 when the museum's current site, the Palazzo Sanguinetti, opened to the public. The palace was reopened after a long and careful restoration that brought the rich, interior [[frescoe]]s back to their original splendour. These frescoes were first completed between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and provide one of the finest examples of Napoleonic and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] decoration.

The purpose of the museum was to make the public aware of the rich musical heritage owned by the Comune di Bologna. Until recently, much of this heritage remained confined in warehouses – primarily due to lack of adequate space – and was only brought out occasionally for temporary display.

Palazzo Sanguinetti offered the possibility to enhance the cultural value of such precious musical heritage and to provide an environment worthy of the priceless items displayed. The palace also guarantees ideal conditions for managing and conserving these items.

The institute is now divided into two sites. An ample selection of volumes, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the museum halls in Strada Maggiore 34 (Palazzo Sanguinetti), while the majority of bibliographic material is accessible in Piazza Rossini 2 (the ex-Convent of San Giacomo) in rooms attached to the G.B. Martini Conservatory of Music.

====The Palazzo Sanguinetti====
In the early 16th century, the original core of the Palazzo Sanguinetti belonged to the Loiani family. The building was sold in 1569 to the Bolognese brothers, Ercole and Giulio Riario, who were originally from Savona and were related to the della Roveres. Having acquired neighboring land and buildings, Senator Ercole Riario had the home reconstructed and enlarged. The individual homes were united into one structure, and construction on the impressive staircase, which still characterizes the building today, was likely begun. The second major reconstruction was commissioned by Count Antonio Aldini, to whom the Marquis Raffaello Riario Sforza had granted a long-term lease in 1796. Count Aldini tasked the architect Giovanni Battista Martinetti (1774–1830) with modernizing the building. A neighboring house was attached to the tower belonging to the Oseletti family, and the huge 16th-century hall was divide into two rooms, which correspond to the modern museum's two most spacious rooms – the vestibule, or the Room of Virtues, and the Ballroom.

Following the fall of [[Napoleon]] and the economic ruin of Aldini, the palace was sold to the Cuban nobleman don Diego Pegnalverd, a former member of the Napoleonic government. Upon his death in 1832, the palazzo passed to the famous tenor, [[Domenico Donzelli]]. It is noted that [[Gioachino Rossini]] stayed there while his own nearby home was under reconstruction. In 1870 the Sanguinetti family purchased the building. They were responsible for the most recent decorations in the intended library and the “Egyptian Room.” During recent renovations of the palazzo, marvelous frescoes were discovered in these two areas.

In 1986 the last heiress, Eleonora Sanguinetti, donated the larger part of the building to the Comune di Bologna in memory – as she wrote in her will – of “my unforgettable father, Dr. Guido Sanguinetti. I wanted to donate the building in Strada Maggiore 34 in his name and memory, and for the love that he always had for his city and his home, so that it could become a music museum and library.”

===The frescos and decorations===
The Palazzo Sanguinetti decorations displays works by major 18th- and 19th-century [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] painters, such as [[Pelagio Palagi]] (1777–1860), [[Serafino Barozzi]], and [[Antonio Basoli]] (1774–1848), under the direction of [[Vincenzo Martinelli]] (1737–1807). On the ground floor, the landscape fresco (a magnificent trompe-l'oeil perspective) is attributed to [[Luigi Busatti]], while the [[quadratura]] is the work of [[Francesco Santini]] (1763–1840). Santini, with the probable collaboration of [[Serafino Barozzi]] (1735–1810), also decorated the walls of the grand staircase. On the first floor, the Woodland Room (Room 1), used as and called the Banquet Room, was designed by Martinelli: he illustrates landscapes rich with greenery and classical architecture in the distance. These classical elements surround the onlooker in the illusion of a step that supports hermes and statues of Bacchus and Ceres, works by a young Palagi.&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions by Paola Foschi writes in the museum guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aeneas Room (Room 2), also by Palagi, depicts stories of the [[Aeneid]] on a black, ''Etruscan'' background. The Zodiac and Aurora Room (Room 3) depicts the Zodiac signs by Domenico Corsini (1774–1814) and a figure of Aurora, attributed to Palagi. The last small room of the east wing (Room 4) is decorated by artists from the Barozzi workshop.  They are also credited with the two rooms (Rooms 6 and 7) that conclude the west wing, which are decorated in ''oriental'' style with curtains and pavilions, exotic plants, and feminine figures with small umbrellas. Room 5 is the Ballroom. At the end of the museum tour are two salons in the apartment designed by Aldini; they were the first two rooms to be decorated. The original room (Room 8), is decorated by Antonio Basoli in a ''neo-gothic'' style, with figures, statues, and bass reliefs by [[Pietro Fancelli]] (1764–1850).

====Father Giovanni Battista Martini====
[[File:Padre Martini 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Padre Gianbattista Martini. Author: Angelo Crescimbeni, 1770.]]

The original core of the museum's musical collections is credited to the Conventual Franciscan [[friar]], [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] (Bologna, April 24, 1706 – August 3, 1784), important 18th-century music scholar and collector, a theorist and composer, and a teacher of counterpoint. [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Mozart|Wolfgang Amadé Mozart]] were among his students.

At only 19 years old, Martini was appointed chapel-master of the Church of [[Basilica of San Francesco, Bologna|San Francesco]] in Bologna. His fame as an excellent teacher and connoisseur of music began to grow when he “won” a dispute with the scholar, Redi, regarding the interpretation of a mysterious ''canone dell'Animuccia'' that existed in the choir gallery of the Santa Casa di Loreto, where Redi himself was chapel-master. After this triumph, not content with being only a scholar, he continued his music studies and was an admired composer of [[sonatas]] for the harpsichord, canons, and about 500 unpublished musical pieces.

The numerous letters conserved in the library (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] who had contacts with Martini. Even the [[Emperor of Austria]] visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the walls of his library in the Monastery of San Francesco.

===Exhibition path===
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart, composer Author:unknown, 1777.]]
The museum path opens among the lush decorations of '''the Boschereccia Room''' with some symbolic works which serve as an introduction to the museum and prepare the visitor for their trip through the musical universe.

'''Rooms 2''' and 3 are dedicated to the spiritual father of the new museum, pictured in an oval by Angelo Crescimbeni: Giambattista Martini, whose priceless moral heritage, both intellectual and material, is celebrated here and made known to the greater public.
&lt;br /&gt;
In '''Room 3''', the relationships between [[Padre Martini]] and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young [[Mozart]] or [[Johann Christian Bach]], who is represented in the famous portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], are displayed. In the same room, one can also admire the famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]].&lt;br /&gt;
'''Room 4''' (“The Idea of Music”) follows, which is dedicated to the musical scholars from the 15th century to the 17th century, with important examples of musical treatises, and portraits of their respective authors. This room also contains some musical instruments of great importance, like the unique omnitonum harpsichord  by [[Vito Trasuntino]] ([[Venice]] 1606).

Some of the more relevant pieces are on display in the following '''Room 5''' (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the “Books for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.” In this room, rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases in the center of the room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.

Then there are the instruments: lutes; the harmony of flutes by Manfredo Settala of 1650, which represents a real unicum;
the pochette, various little violins used as instruments by dance instructors, the ghironde, the serpentoni, the extraordinary series of horns and cornets from the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally, a unique performance instrument: the tiorba, which is in the shape of a khitára.

Italian opera is the focus of the following room.
The 18th century are first in '''Room 6''', dedicated to the famous singer [[Carlo Broschi]], known as [[Farinelli]].

His beautiful portrait, painted by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], dominates the room, together with the portraits of the castrati from various periods and of composers from the time, such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa]].

'''Room 7''' places the visitor in the 19th century with [[Gioachino Rossini]], whose name is forever tied to [[Bologna]]. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first recitals of [[Isabella Colbran]], a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of [[The Barber of Seville]] and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by [[Camille Pleyel]].

The path proceeds through the centuries, the musical uses, and styles in '''Room 8''', which is dedicated to “Books for music and instruments in the 18th and 19th centuries.” There are viole d'amore and flutes along with the original scores composed by [[Torelli]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Ferdinando Bertoni|Bertoni]], etc. There are also clarinets and the beautiful Buccin, created in [[Lyon]] by Jean Baptiste Tabard (1812–1845).

Concluding the exhibit, '''Room 9''' pays a proper tribute to two important people in the Italian and Bolognese musical culture, [[Giuseppe Martucci]] and [[Ottorino Respighi]].  This room displays the composer's portraits, photographs, and a selection of works from the Respighi property, which were donated to the library in 1961 by his widow, Elsa, for the 25th anniversary of his death. In the same room lies the portrait of the musician Arrigo Serato, painted by the famous artist [[Felice Casorati]].

===Collections===
The first floor of the Palazzo is home to the nine rooms of the exhibition, which illustrates about six centuries of the history of European music. There are over one hundred paintings of famous people from the music world, which are a part of the picture gallery started by Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, more than eighty antique musical instruments, and a large selection of valuable historical documents, such as treatises, volumes, opera libretti, letters, manuscripts, original musical scores, etc.

==Library==
[[File:Due sportelli di libreria con scaffali di libri di musica.jpg|thumb|right|Libreria. Autore:G.M.Crespi, c. 1720 – 1730. Collocazione: Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica]]
The collection inherited from Padre Martini constitutes one of the most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini painstakingly kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.
Saved from the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations  due to the intervention of [[Stanislao Mattei]], Martini's disciple and successor, the valuable bibliographic patrimony was donated to the Liceo musicale di [[Bologna]] in 1816. The Liceo had been founded in 1804 at the ex-convent of the Agostinians in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The library grew considerably throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, thanks to the amount of materials produced from the didactic activity of the Liceo (famous students of the Liceo included Rossini, Donizetti, and Respighi and directors Mancinelli, Martucci, and Busoni).
The library also grew because of the valuable items and rare volumes that were acquired by [[Gaetano Gaspari]], who was appointed as librarian in 1855.
Gaspari directed the library for many years with a unique zeal and knowledge. After many years of hard work and constant effort, he was able to excellently organize and card-catalogue all the library material (also from this period came the posthumous publication, the "Library Catalogue of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna", which bears his name and is now also available online).
In 1942, when the Liceo musicale was transformed into a state institution – Regio Conservatorio di Musica – the [[Comune di Bologna]] chose to maintain ownership of Padre Martini's bibliographic patrimony and the attached picture gallery.
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 in order to conserve and make the most of the bibliographic patrimony and portrait gallery.

===Picture gallery===
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|right|Supposed portrait of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]. Author and date unknown.]]
There is not much information about the development of the picture gallery, which seems to have had no rivals in [[Bologna]] during the 18th century. From the valuable letters of correspondence that [[Padre Martini]] kept with different well-known people of the time (for example, musicians that were his students in [[Bologna]], members of the [[Philharmonic Academy of Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]], music theorists, composers, nobles, illustrious intellectuals, chapel masters, and custodians of Franciscan convents), it is evident that there was a complex network of informers and intermediaries that were responsible for finding the portraits he desired.
Many of the portraits were commissioned to the artists directly by [[Padre Martini]]. The painters drew the features of the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings as much as their plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator – music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.
It's worth noting that there are many paintings by famous artists present in the collection, including the portrait of [[Farinelli]] by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], the portrait of [[Johann Christian Bach]] by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], and one of [[Charles Burney]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]].
It also seems that the prestige of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable [[Europe]]an expert on the art of music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.
The picture gallery remained in the convent of [[San Francesco]] even after Martini's death, surviving the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei. Only in 1801 was it transferred to the ex-convent of the Agostinians at the Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore. Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on canvas with some pastels and drawings.

===The collection of musical instruments===
The musical instruments displayed in the rooms of the museum originate from the collections of two important Bolognese institutions: the Museo Civico Medievale and the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. The core of this collection from the Museo Civico Medievale comes from the Liceo musicale, which was founded in 1804. As Federico Parisini (the Liceo librarian from 1881 to 1891) explained, following the Napoleonic suppressions, “the instruments, many famous musical works, chorus books, rare instruments, and other items related to music were sold publicly.”
The central administration of the Dipartimento del Reno had asked the government of the Repubblica Cisalpina to purchase and conserve the objects that risked being dispersed. The recovered instruments were then entrusted to the Liceo and, in 1881, were finally added to the Museo Civico Medievale, where they have remained until today.
Among the most valuable instruments now displayed in the rooms of the museum is the Trasuntino harpsichord of 1606 (displayed in Room 4). It was constructed for Camillo Gonzaga, the Count of Novellara, and afterwards was passed to Giuseppe Baini (1775–1844), the celebrated author of the first biography of [[Palestrina]]. In his will, Baini bequeathed the harpsichord to the Liceo Musicale. Other valuable instruments on display are the Trasuntino monochord, which was built to tune the cymbal, and the 5-reed flute, which is able to mimic several flutes playing in harmony. There is also the polyphonic flute (displayed in Room 5), which bears the mark of Manfredo Settala (1600–1680), a Milanese rector, who was a great collector and famous personality in the cultural panorama of the 17th century.
The origin of the collection of musical instruments in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale is more uncertain. The collection includes some particularly important models, such as eight pianos, five of which are grand pianos and three of which are rectangular. These pianos date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Among these are the priceless Erard from 1811 (that possibly belonged to Paolina Borghese), which was restored for the inauguration of the museum and is now exhibited in Room 8. Also included are [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] piano of 1844 (exhibited in Room 7), and the so-called “spinette of Padre Martini”, a rectangular Glonner from 1780 (displayed in Room 3). Other important instruments on display are the Heckelphon of 1900 (Room 8), various English horns, some cornets, and two oboes.

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

The '''National Graphene Institute''' is a [[research institute]] and building at the [[University of Manchester]] that is focused on the research of [[graphene]]. Construction of the building to house the institute started in 2013&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; and finished in 2015.

== Institute ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The building in 2016]]
The creation of the institute, including the construction of the building, cost £61&amp;nbsp;million. Funded by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] (£38m) and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Regional Development Fund]] (£23m), the building is the national centre for graphene research in the UK. It provides facilities for industry and university academics to collaborate on [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32100071 graphene applications] and the commercialisation of graphene. The building was opened on 20 March 2015 by [[George Osborne]].&lt;ref name="UoM20Mar15" /&gt;

== Building ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The National Graphene Institute under construction in August 2014]]
The five-story glass-fronted building provides {{convert|7,600|sqm|sqft}} of research space. This includes 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of class [[Cleanroom|100 and class 1000 clean rooms]], one of which occupies the entire lower ground floor (in order to minimise vibrations&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;)&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; plus laser, optical, metrology and chemical laboratories, along with offices, a seminar room and accommodation.&lt;ref name="jestico" /&gt; The top floor also includes a roof terrace, which has 21 different grasses and wildflowers designed to attract urban bees and other species of pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Graphene Institute (NGI) {{!}} The University of Manchester|url = http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/collaborate/national-graphene-institute/|website = www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the building consists of a composite cladding, with an external stainless steel 'veil'.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt; The building faces on to [[Booth Street East]]. Construction started in March 2013, with the building being completed in 2015.&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt;

The building was designed by [[Jestico + Whiles]]. It cost around £30m, and was constructed by [[Bam Construct]]. The structural design was produced by [[Ramboll]]. Other shortlisted organisations are: [[Lend Lease Group|Lend Lease]], [[Laing O’Rourke]], [[Morgan Sindall]], [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]], and [[M&amp;W Group]]).&lt;ref name="BuildingMay13" /&gt; The design work was led by [[EC Harris]], along with [[CH2M Hill]] who provided specialist technical architecture design services for the cleanrooms and laboratories, together with Mechanical, Electrical and Process (MEP) consultant services.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;

=== History of the location ===
[[File:Excavations at the site of the National Graphene Institute 19.jpg|thumb|right|Excavations at the site of the Institute.]]
The Institute was constructed on the former site of the Albert Club, which was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] club that was located between Lawson Street and Clifford Street.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was established for the middle class [[Germans|German]] community that were involved in Manchester's [[cotton trade]], and [[Friedrich Engels]] frequented it during his time in the city, becoming a member in 1842.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was located on Clifford Street from 1842 prior to its relocation in 1859.&lt;ref name="engelsbook" /&gt; The building was constructed by the architect [[Jeptha Pacey]] as his personal house, and it was fronted by formal gardens. It was later converted into a private social club, which was named after [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. More recently it had been re-purposed as [[Turkish bath|Turkish]] [[Public bathing|public baths]],&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; and was later used as a hospital for women and children.&lt;ref name="museummeets" /&gt; The building was demolished in the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and the site was used for the construction of the Lamb Building.&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt;

The excavations that took place in February 2013 by [[Oxford Archaeology North]], prior to the construction of the Institute, uncovered the remnants of the club building along with a row of five cellars belonging to 1830s [[terraced housing]]. A sink removed from the site has been incorporated into the institute's new building.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; As the main clean room of the new building will be located 3 metres below ground level,&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt; the remains of the Albert Club were not conserved.

The '''operating point''' is a specific point within the operation [[Receiver operating characteristic|characteristic]] of a technical device. This point will be engaged because of the properties of the system and the outside influences and parameters. 
In [[electronic engineering]] establishing an operating point is called [[biasing]].

== Wanted and unwanted operating points of a system ==
[[File:operating point stable.png|thumb|Operating point of a system consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump)]]
The operating point of a system is the intersection point of the torque-speed curve of drive and machine. Both devices are linked with a shaft so the speed is always identical. The drive creates the torque which rotates both devices. The machine creates the counter-torque, e.g. by being a moved device which needs permanent energy or a wheel turning against the static friction of the track.

* The drive speed increases when the driving torque is higher than the counter-torque.
* The drive speed decreases when the counter-torque is higher than the driving torque.
 
At the operating point the driving torque and the counter-torque are balanced, hence the speed does not change anymore.

* A speed change in a stable operating point creates a torque change which acts against this change of speed.

A change in speed out of this stable operating point is only possible with a new control intervention. This can be changing the load of the machine or the power of the drive which both changes the torque because it is a change in the characteristic curves. The drive-machine system then runs to a new operating point with a different speed and a different balance of torques.
 
Should the drive torque be higher than the counter torque at any time then the system does not have an operating point. The result will be that the speed increases up to the idle speed or even until destruction. Should the counter torque be higher at any times the speed will decrease until the system stops.

== Stable and unstable operating points ==

[[File:operating point instable.png|thumb|Unstable operating point of an engine consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump)]]
Also in case of an unstable operating point the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the operating point is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and outer friction as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable operating point is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point. Running at an unstable operating point is therefore undesirable.

The middle point on the curve in the third picture on the right is an unstable point, too. However the above-mentioned assumptions are not valid here. Torque and speed are the same but in case the speed will be increased only little then the torque of the drive will be much higher than the counter-torque of the machine. The same but vice versa applies when reducing the speed.  For this reason this operating point does not have a stabilizing effect on the speed. The speed will run away to the left or the right side of the point and the drive will run stable there.

== Wanted and unwanted operating points ==

[[File:operating points wanted unwanted.png|thumb|Wanted and unwanted operating points of an engine]]
In the lower right picture the electrical drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant counter-torque over the whole range of speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way.
 
In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics in the middle of the curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the counter torque will only be introduced when the load-less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past [[Brushed DC electric motor#Shunt wound motor|shunt-motors]] have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous [[AC motor]]s are being used or AC motors in combination with a [[Variable-frequency drive|variable frequency drive]].

==Electronics==
In an electronic [[amplifier]], an operating point is a combination of current and voltage at "no signal" conditions; application of a signal to the stage - changes voltage and current in the stage. The operating point in an [[amplifier]] is set by the intersection of the [[load line(electronics)|load line]] with the non-linear characteristics of the device.  By adjusting the bias on the stage, an operating point can be selected that maximizes the signal output of the stage and minimizes distortion.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to anthropology:

'''[[Anthropology]]''' &amp;ndash; study of [[human]]ity.  Anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], the [[humanities]], and the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used by [[François Péron]] when discussing his encounters with [[Tasmanian Aborigines]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;[[Tim Flannery|Flannery, T.F.]] (1994) ''The Future Eaters:  An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people'' Chatswood:  New South Wales {{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What ''type'' of thing is anthropology? ==
Anthropology can be described as all of the following:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.

'''Pluriculturalism''' is an approach to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react from the perspective of multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures.  As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity.&lt;ref name=Scribd&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/48131676/pluriculturalism-2 pluriculturalism (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification.&lt;ref name=UGR&gt;Trujillo Sáez, Fernando.

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

'''Serindian art''' is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century C.E. in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]].

It derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. Greek-influenced culture was most probably in existence prior to [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasions, Afghanistan natives retained this influence which was lost in Greece.{{Verify source|date=November 2017}}

Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this artistic influence, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian.

In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of [[Sir Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

'''Sheila Sen Jasanoff''' is an [[Indian American]] academic and significant contributor to the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]].

==Early life and education==
Born in India, Jasanoff attended [[Radcliffe College]], where she studied mathematics as an undergraduate, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1964.  She then studied linguistics, receiving her M.A. at the [[University of Bonn]] (then part of West Germany). She returned to Harvard to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics in 1973, and a J.D. at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1976. She practiced environmental law in Boston from 1976 to 1978. She and her husband then accepted positions at [[Cornell University]], where she became a pioneer in the newly emerging field of Science and Technology Studies. In 1998, Jasanoff joined the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of public policy. In 2002, she became Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies.&lt;ref name=Crimson2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Le|first1=Quynh-Nhu|title=Sheila S.

==Work==
Jasanoff founded and directs the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite web|title=Director: Sheila Jasanoff|url=http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/people/director.html|website=Program on Science, Technology &amp; Society|publisher=Kennedy School of Government Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on science and the state in contemporary democratic societies.  Her work is relevant to science &amp; technology studies, comparative politics, law and society, political and legal anthropology, sociology and policy analysis.  Jasanoff's research has considerable empirical breadth, spanning the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, and India, as well as emerging global regimes in areas such as climate and biotechnology.

One line of Jasanoff's work demonstrates how the political culture of different democratic societies influences how they assess evidence and expertise in policymaking.  Her first book (with Brickman and Ilgen), ''Controlling Chemicals'' (1985), examines the regulation of toxic substances in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman, Ilgen, and Jasanoff, ''Controlling Chemicals''.  Cornell University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book showed how the routines of decision making in these countries reflected different conceptions of what counts as evidence and of how expertise should operate in a policy context.  In ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'' (2005), she has shown how different societies employ different modes of public reasoning when making decisions involving science and technology.&lt;ref name=Ezrahi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezrahi|first1=Yaron|title=Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and 'Civic Epistemology'|journal=Metascience|date=7 May 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=177–198|doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'', Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   These differences, which in part reflect distinct "civic epistemologies," are deeply embedded in institutions and shape how policy issues are framed and processed by the bureaucratic machinery of  modern states.

Jasanoff has also contributed to scholarship on the interaction of science and law.  ''Science at the Bar'' (1995), for example, reached beyond the prevailing diagnoses of structural incompatibilities between science and law to explore how these socially embedded institutions interact and, to a certain extent, mutually constitute each other.&lt;ref name=Keniston&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keniston|first1=Kenneth|title=Book Review Science at the Bar: Law, science, and technology in America By Sheila Jasanoff. 285 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1995. $29.95. 0-674-79302-1|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 May 1996|volume=334|issue=19|pages=1274–1274|doi=10.1056/NEJM199605093341918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Science at the Bar'', Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of regulatory science, conducted for the purposes of meeting legally mandated standards, and the "boundary" drawing activities of science advisory committees are analyzed in ''The Fifth Branch'' (1990).&lt;ref name=Burger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Edward J.|title=Book Review The Fifth Branch: Science advisers as policy-makers By Sheila Jasanoff. 302 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1990. $27.95.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 May 1991|volume=324|issue=21|pages=1518–1518|doi=10.1056/NEJM199105233242124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''The Fifth Branch: Science Advisors as Policymakers'', Harvard University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;   More recently, she has explored the "rise of the statistical victim" in toxic torts, as the law with its individualistic orientation has increasingly encountered, and sought ways to accommodate, the statistical vision of such fields as epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "Science and the Statistical Victim: Modernizing Knowledge in Breast Implant Litigation," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 32, No. 1 (Feb., 2002), pp. 37-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work on science and law, as well as her research on science in the state, she takes an approach that links ideas from constitutional law, political theory, and science studies to consider the "constitutional" role of science in modern democratic states.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "In a Constitutional Moment," in ''Social Studies of Science and Technology: Looking back, Ahead'' (Bernward Joerges &amp; Helga Nowotny, eds., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff  has considered the [[politics of science]] not only in a comparative but also in a global context.  Examples include her work on the transnational aspects of the [[Bhopal disaster]] (''Learning from Disaster'' 1994);&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Oran R.|title=International cooperation : building regimes for natural resources and the environment|date=1989|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, Ny|isbn=978-0801495212|edition=3rd reprint.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U92Nw5FnGLsC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; her research on the formation and politics of global scientific advisory bodies such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]; and her research on national and global environmental movements (e.g., Earthy Politics, 2004).&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Eric|title=Why we argue about climate change|date=2013|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne|isbn=9781863956086|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X6f5d9w_tkC&amp;pg=PT31|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff also has contributed to building Science and Technology Studies as a field.

The term '''skin flora''' (also commonly referred to as '''skin microbiota''') refers to the microorganisms which reside on the skin, typically human skin.

Many of them are [[bacterium|bacteria]] of which there are around 1000 species upon human skin from nineteen  [[Phylum|phyla]].&lt;ref name="Grice"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grice EA, Kong HH, Conlan S | year = 2009 | title = Topographical and Temporal Diversity of the Human Skin Microbiome | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5931| pages = 1190–1192 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171700 | pmid = 19478181 | pmc=2805064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"&gt;Pappas S.

ScienceNOW Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are found in the superficial layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the upper parts of [[hair follicle]]s.

Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either [[commensalism|commensal]] (are not harmful to their host) or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient [[pathogenic]] organisms from [[Infection#Colonization|colonizing]] the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cogen AL, Nizet V, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence? | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 158 | issue = 3| pages = 442–55 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08437.x | pmid = 18275522 | pmc=2746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, resident microbes can cause [[skin disease]]s and enter the [[blood system]], creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in [[immunosuppressed]] people.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

A major non-human skin flora is ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid]] and non-hyphal zoosporic fungus that causes [[chytridiomycosis]], an infectious disease thought to be responsible for the [[decline in amphibian populations]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Species variety==
===Bacteria===
[[image:Staphylococcus epidermidis 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' one of roughly a thousand [[bacteria]] species present on human [[skin]]. Though usually not [[pathogenic]], it can cause [[skin infection]]s and even life-threatening illnesses in those that are [[immunocompromised]].]]

The estimate of the number of species present on skin bacteria has been radically changed by the use of [[16S ribosomal RNA]] to identify bacterial species present on skin samples direct from their genetic material. Previously such identification had depended upon [[microbiological culture]] upon which many varieties of bacteria did not grow and so were hidden to science.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' were thought from cultural based research to be dominant. However [[16S ribosomal RNA]] research finds that while common, these species make up only 5% of skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Grice08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grice EA, Kong HH, Renaud G, Young AC, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Wolfsberg TG, Turner ML, Segre JA | year = 2008 | title = A diversity profile of the human skin microbiota | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2493393&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Genome Res | volume = 18 | issue = 7| pages = 1043–50 | pmid = 18502944 | doi=10.1101/gr.075549.107 | pmc=2493393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for [[bacteria]]. Most come from four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).
[[File:Skin Microbiome20161-300.jpg|thumb|ecology of the 20 sites on the skin studied in the Human Microbiome Project]]

There are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' and ''[[Staphylococci]]'' species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. In moist places on the body ''[[Corynebacteria]]'' together with ''[[Staphylococci]]'' dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]] are dominant. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry one. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside the nostril), and on the back.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

===Fungal===
A study of the area between toes in 100 young adults found 14 different genera of fungi. These include [[yeast]]s such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula rubra]]'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', [[dermatophytes]] (skin living fungi) such as ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'',  and ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' and [[nondermatophyte]] fungi (opportunistic fungi that can live in skin) such as ''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]'', ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]'', ''[[Curvularia]]'', ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyeka CA, Ugwu LO | year = 2002 | title = Fungal flora of human toe webs | url = | journal = Mycoses | volume = 45 | issue = 11–12| pages = 488–91 | pmid = 12472726 | doi=10.1046/j.1439-0507.2002.00796.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], researched the DNA of human skin fungi at 14 different locations on the body. These were the ear canal, between the eyebrows, the back of the head, behind the ear, the heel, toenails, between the toes, forearm, back, groin, nostrils, chest, palm, and the crook of the elbow. The study showed a large fungal diversity across the body, the richest habitat being the heel, which hosts about 80 species of fungi. By way of contrast, there are some 60 species in toenail clippings and 40 between the toes. Other rich areas are the palm, forearm and inside the elbow, with from 18 to 32 species. The head and the trunk hosted between 2 and 10 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22622689 BBC News item]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belly Button Biodiversity Project began at North Carolina State University in early 2011 with two initial groups of 35 and 25 volunteers.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  Volunteers were given sterile cotton swabs and were asked to insert the cotton swabs into their navels, to turn the cotton swab around three times and then return the cotton swab to the researchers in a vial &lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=What's in Your Belly Button|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/whats-in-your-belly-button/?_r=1|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   that contained a 0.5 ml 10% phosphate saline buffer.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;   Researchers at North Carolina State University, led by Jiri Hulcr,&lt;ref name="Nierenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nierenberg|first=Cari|title=New meaning to 'navel-gazing': Scientists study Belly Button Bacteria|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-meaning-navel-gazing-scientists-study-belly-button-bacteria-1C6437445?franchiseSlug=healthmain|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then grew the samples in a culture until the bacterial colonies were large enough to be photographed and then these pictures were posted on the Belly Button Biodiversity Project’s  website (volunteers were given sample numbers so that they could view their own samples online).&lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"/&gt;  These samples then were analyzed using 16S rDNA libraries so that strains that did not grow well in cultures could be identified.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

The researchers at North Carolina State University discovered that while it was difficult to predict every strain of bacteria in the microbiome of the navel that they could predict which strains would be prevalent and which strains of bacteria would be quite rare in the microbiome.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  It was found that the navel microbiomes only contained a few prevalent types of bacteria (Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteria, Clostridiales, and Bacilli) and many different types of rare bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt; Other types of rare organisms were discovered inside the navels of the volunteers including three types of Archaea (an organism that usually lives in only extreme environments){{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} and two of the three types of Archaea were found in one volunteer who claimed not to have bathed or showered for many years.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

''Staphylococcus'' and ''Corynebacterium'' were among the most common types of bacteria found in the navels of this project’s volunteers and these types of bacteria have been found to be the most common types of bacteria found on the human skin in larger studies of the skin microbiome  &lt;ref name="Callewaert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callewaert|first=Chris|author2=Frederiek-Maarten Kerckhof |author3=Michael S.

According to the Belly Button Biodiversity Project &lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  at North Carolina State University, there are two types of microorganisms found in the navel and surrounding areas. Transient bacteria (bacteria that does not reproduce) &lt;ref name="Kong"/&gt;    forms  the majority of the organisms found in the navel, and an estimated 1400 various strains were found in 95% of participants of the study.&lt;ref name="saunders-blog"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Saunders| first = Chris| title = Navel gazing at NC State leads to important discovery| work = Red &amp; White for Life :: NC State University Alumni Association| accessdate = 2013-04-20| date = 2011-07-12| url = http://www.alumniblog.ncsu.edu/2011/07/12/navel-gazing-at-nc-state-leads-to-important-discovery/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to host ==
Skin microflora can be [[commensalism|commensal]]s, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogen]]s. Often they can be all three depending upon the strength of the person's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; Research upon the immune system in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[lungs]] has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause [[dermatitis]]. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as [[Mupirocin]]). This works against  [[staphylococcal]] and [[streptococcal]] infections.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] species such as ''[[Candida krusei]]'', ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Torulopsis glabrata]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kerr JR | year = 1994 | title = Suppression of fungal growth exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=263067&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 525–7 | pmid = 8150966 | pmc=263067}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also inhibit the growth of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krausse R, Piening K, Ullmann U | year = 2005 | title = Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori | url = | journal = Lett Appl Microbiol | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 81–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01632.x | pmid = 15613007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that "removing ''P. aeruginosa'' from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection."&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

Another aspect of bacteria is the generation of [[body odor]]. [[Sweat]] is odorless however several bacteria may consume it and create byproducts which may be considered putrid by man (as in contrast to flies, for example, that may find them attractive/appealing).
Several examples are:
* ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' in  adolescent and adult sebaceous glands can turn its [[amino acid]]s into [[propionic acid]].
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' creates body odor by breaking sweat into [[isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, etal |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can. J. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=357–64 |year=2006 |pmid=16699586 |doi=10.1139/w05-130 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' creates strong foot odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, Koike K, Okisaka K, Hagura T, Kamiya T, Tomita F | year = 2006 | title = Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control | url = | journal = Can J Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 357–64 | pmid = 16699586 | doi=10.1139/w05-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin defenses==
===Antimicrobial peptides===
The skin creates [[antimicrobial peptides]] such as [[cathelicidin]]s  that control the proliferation of skin microbes. Cathelicidins not only reduce microbe numbers directly but also cause the secretion of [[cytokine]] release which induces [[inflammation]], [[angiogenesis]], and [[reepithelialization]]. Conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] have been linked to the suppression in cathelicidin production. In [[rosacea]] abnormal processing of cathelicidin cause inflammation. [[Psoriasis]] has been linked to self-DNA created from cathelicidin peptides that causes [[Autoimmunity|autoinflammation]]. A major factor controlling cathelicidin is [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schauber J, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2639779&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Allergy Clin Immunol | volume = 122 | issue = 2| pages = 261–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.03.027 | pmid = 18439663 | pmc=2639779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acidity===
The superficial layers of the skin are naturally acidic ([[pH]] 4-4.5) due to lactic acid in [[sweat]] and produced by skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Lambers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambers H, Piessens S, Bloem A, Pronk H, Finkel P | year = 2006 | title = Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora | url = | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci. | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 359–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x | pmid = 18489300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this pH mutualistic flora such as ''[[Staphylococci]]'', ''[[Micrococci]]'', ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' grow but not transient bacteria such as [[Gram negative bacteria]] like ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or [[Gram positive]] ones such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; Another factor affecting the growth of pathological bacteria is that the antimicrobial substances secreted by the skin are enhanced in acidic conditions.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; In alkaline conditions, bacteria cease to be attached to the skin and are more readily shed. It has been observed that the skin also swells  under alkaline conditions and opens up allowing move to the surface.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt;

===Immune system===
If activated, the [[immune system]] in the skin produces [[cell-mediated immunity]] against microbes such as [[dermatophyte]]s (skin fungi).&lt;ref name="Dahl"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahl MV | year = 1993 | title = Suppression of immunity and inflammation by products produced by dermatophytes | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 28 | issue = 5 Pt 1| pages = S19–S23 | pmid = 8496406 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(09)80303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction is to increase [[stratum corneum]] turnover and so shed the fungus from the skin surface. Skin fungi such as ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' have evolved to create substances that limit the immune response to them.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt; The shedding of skin is a general means to control the buildup of flora upon the skin surface.

==Skin diseases==
Microorganisms play a role in noninfectious [[Bacterial skin disease|skin disease]]s such as [[atopic dermatitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Bruce Baker (geneticist) | author = Baker BS | year = 2006 | title = The role of microorganisms in atopic dermatitis | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1809642&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02980.x | pmid = 16542358 | pmc=1809642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rosacea]], [[psoriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paulino LC, Tseng CH, Strober BE, Blaser MJ |authorlink4=Martin Blaser | year = 2006 | title = Molecular analysis of fungal microbiota in samples from healthy human skin and psoriatic lesions | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1594634&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 44 | issue = 8| pages = 2933–41 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.00785-06 | pmid = 16891514 | pmc=1594634}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holland KT, Cunliffe WJ, Roberts CD | year = 1977 | title = Acne vulgaris: an investigation into the number of anaerobic diphtheroids and members of the Micrococcaceae in normal and acne skin | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 623–6 | pmid = 141301 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1977.tb05206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged skin can cause nonpathogenic bacteria to become [[pathogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth RR, James WD | year = 1988 | title = Microbial ecology of the skin | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 441–64 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.42.100188.002301 | pmid = 3144238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of species on the skin is related to later development of dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|last2=Gallo|first2=Richard L.|title=Evidence that Human Skin Microbiome Dysbiosis Promotes Atopic Dermatitis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022202X17329603|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=137|issue=12|pages=2460–2461|doi=10.1016/j.jid.2017.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acne vulgaris===
[[Acne vulgaris]] is a common skin condition characterised by excessive sebum production by the [[sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous unit]] and inflammation of the skin.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitz-Gibbon|first1=S|last2=Shuta|first2=T|last3=Bor-Han|first3=C|last4=Nguyen|first4=L|last5=Du|first5=C|last6=Minghsun|first6=L|last7=Elashoff|first7=D|last8=Erfe|first8=MC|last9=Loncaric|first9=A|last10=Kim|first10=J|last11=Modlin|first11=RL|last12=Miller|first12=JF|last13=Sodergren|first13=E|last14=Craft|first14=N|last15=Weinstock|first15=GM|last16=Li|first16=H|title=''Propionibacterium acnes'' Strain Populations in the Human Skin Microbiome Associated with Acne|journal=J Invest Dermatol|date=2013|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2152–2160|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.21|pmid=23337890|url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v133/n9/full/jid201321a.html|pmc=3745799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected areas are typically colonised by ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]''; a member of the [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbiota even in those without acne.&lt;ref name="Grice2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grice|first1=EA|title=The skin microbiome: potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cutaneous disease|journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg.|date=2014|volume=33|issue=2|pages=98–103|pmid=25085669|pmc=4425451|url=http://www.edermatologynews.com/scms-journal/volume-33/june-precision-medicine/single-view/the-skin-microbiome-potential-for-novel-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-approaches-to-cutaneous-disease/9077f05398694bf23b88073641fcfa8d.html|doi=10.12788/j.sder.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; High populations of ''P. acnes'' are linked to acne vulgaris although only certain strains are strongly associated with acne while others with healthy skin. The relative population of ''P. acnes'' is similar between those with acne and those without.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;

Current treatment includes topical and systemic antibacterial drugs which result in decreased ''P. acnes'' colonisation and/or activity.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannigan|first1=GD|last2=Grice|first2=EA|title=Microbial ecology of the skin in the era of metagenomics and molecular microbiology|journal=Cold Spring Harb Perpect Med|date=2013|volume=3|issue=12|page=a015362|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a015362|pmid=24296350|pmc=3839604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatment includes the use of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth. ''S. epidermidis'' produces [[succinic acid]] which has been shown to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muya|first1=S|last2=Wang|first2=Y|last3=Yu|first3=J|last4=Kuo|first4=S|last5=Coda|first5=A|last6=Jiang|first6=Y|last7=Gallo|first7=RL|last8=Huang|first8=CM|title=Fermentation of ''Propionibacterium acnes'', a Commensal Bacterium in the Human Skin Microbiome, as Skin Probiotics against Methicillin-Resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=2|page=e55380|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055380|pmc=3566139|pmid=23405142}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' has also been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory and improve antimicrobial properties of the skin when applied topically. It was also shown to be effective in reducing acne lesion size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muizzuddin|first1=N|last2=Maher|first2=W|last3=Sullivan|first3=M|last4=Schnittger|first4=S|last5=Mammone|first5=T|title=Physiological effect of probiotic on skin.|journal=J Cosmet Sci|date=2012|volume=63|issue=6|pages=385–95|pmid=23286870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atopic Dermatitis===
Individuals with [[atopic dermatitis]] have shown an increase in populations of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in both [[lesion]]al and nonlesional skin.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Atopic dermatitis flares are associated with low bacterial diversity due to colonisation by ''S. aureus'' and following [[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|standard treatment]], bacterial diversity has been seen to increase.

[[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|Current treatments]] include combinations of topical or systemic antibiotics, [[corticosteroids]], and diluted bleach baths.&lt;ref name="Kong2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=HH|last2=Oh|first2=J|last3=Deming|first3=C|last4=Conlan|first4=S|last5=Grice|first5=EA|last6=Beatson|first6=MA|last7=Nomicos|first7=E|last8=Polley|first8=EC|last9=Komarow|first9=HD|last10=NISC Comparative Sequence Program|last11=Murray|first11=PR|last12=Turner|first12=ML|last13=Segre|first13=JA|title=Temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis|journal=Genome Res|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=850–9|doi=10.1101/gr.131029.111|pmid=22310478|pmc=3337431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatments include using the commensal skin bacteria, ''S. epidermidis'', to inhibit ''S. aureus'' growth. During atopic dermatitis flares, population levels of ''S. epidermidis'' has been shown to increase as an attempt to control ''S. aureus populations''.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2012" /&gt;

Low [[Gut flora|gut microbial]] diversity in babies has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahamsson|first1=TR|last2=Jakobsson|first2=HE|last3=Andersson|first3=AF|last4=Björkstén|first4=B|last5=Engstrand|first5=L|last6=Jenmalm|first6=MC|title=Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|date=2012|volume=129|issue=2|pages=434–40, 440.e1–2|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.025|pmid=22153774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants with atopic eczema have low levels of ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and high levels of [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacteroides'' have anti-inflammatory properties which are essential against dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012" /&gt; (See [[gut microbiota]])

===Psoriasis vulgaris===
[[Psoriasis|Psoriasis vulgaris]] typically affects drier skin sites such as elbows and knees. Dry areas of the skin tend to have high microbial diversity and fewer populations than sebaceous sites.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013" /&gt; A study using [[Cotton swab#Usage|swab sampling techniques]] show areas rich in [[Firmicutes]] (mainly ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'') and [[Actinobacteria]] (mainly ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacterium]]'') are associated with psoriasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alekseyenko|first1=AV|last2=Perez-Perez|first2=GI|last3=De Souza|first3=A|last4=Strober|first4=B|last5=Gao|first5=Z|last6=Bihan|first6=M|last7=Li|first7=K|last8=Methé|first8=BA|last9=Blaser|first9=MJ|title=Community differentiation of the cutaneous microbiota in psoriasis|journal=Microbiome|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|doi=10.1186/2049-2618-1-31|pmid=24451201|pmc=4177411}}&lt;/ref&gt; While another study using [[biopsy|biopsies]] associate increased levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with healthy skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahlén|first1=A|last2=Engstrand|first2=L|last3=Baker|first3=BS|last4=Powles|first4=A|last5=Fry|first5=L|title=Comparison of bacterial microbiota in skin biopsies from normal and psoriatic skin.|journal=Arch Dermatol Res|date=2012|volume=304|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s00403-011-1189-x|pmid=22065152}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most studies show that individuals affected by psoriasis have a lower microbial diversity in the affected areas.

Treatments for psoriasis include topical agents, phototherapy, and systemic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menter|first1=A|last2=Griffiths|first2=CE|title=Current and future management of psoriasis.|journal=Lancet|date=2007|volume=370|issue=9583|pages=272–84|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61129-5|pmid=17658398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research on the skin microbiota's role in psoriasis is inconsistent therefore there are no potential probiotic treatments.

===Rosacea===
[[Rosacea]] is typically connected to [[sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] sites of the skin. The skin [[mite]] ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'' produce [[lipases]] that allow them to use sebum as a source of food therefore they have a high affinity for sebaceous skin sites. Although it is a part of the commensal skin microbiota, patients affected with rosacea show an increase in ''D. folliculorum'' compared to healthy individuals, suggesting [[pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casas|first1=C|last2=Paul|first2=C|last3=Lahfa|first3=M|last4=Livideanu|first4=B|last5=Lejeune|first5=O|last6=Alvarez-Georges|first6=S|last7=Saint-Martory|first7=C|last8=Degouy|first8=A|last9=Mengeaud|first9=V|last10=Ginisty|first10=H|last11=Durbise|first11=E|last12=Schmitt|first12=AM|last13=Redoulès|first13=D|title=Quantification of ''Demodex folliculorum'' by PCR in rosacea and its relationship to skin innate immune activation.|journal=Exp Dermatol|date=2012|volume=21|issue=12|pages=906–10|doi=10.1111/exd.12030|pmid=23171449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bacillus oleronius]]'', a ''[[Demodex]]'' associated microbe, is not typically found in the commensal skin microbiota but initiates inflammatory pathways whose starting mechanism is similar to rosacea patients.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Populations of ''S. epidermidis'' have also been isolated from pustules of rosacea patients. However it is possible that they were moved by ''Demodex'' to areas that favour growth as ''Demodex'' has shown to transport bacteria around the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarmuda|first1=S|last2=O'Reilly|first2=N|last3=Zaba|first3=R|last4=Jakubowicz|first4=O|last5=Szkaradkiewicz|first5=A|last6=Kavanagh|first6=K|title=Potential role of Demodex mites and bacteria in the induction of rosacea.|journal=J Med Microbiol|date=2012|volume=61|issue=Pt 11|pages=1504–10|doi=10.1099/jmm.0.048090-0|pmid=22933353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current treatments include topical and oral antibiotics and laser therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AF|last2=Tiemstra|first2=JD|title=Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea|journal=J Am Board Fam Pract.|date=2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=214–7|pmid=12038728}}&lt;/ref&gt; As current research has yet to show a clear mechanism for ''Demodex'' influence in rosacea, there are no potential probiotic treatments.

==Clinical==
===Infected devices ===
Skin microbes are a potential source of infected medical devices such as [[catheters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martín-Rabadán P, Gijón P, Alcalá L, Rodríguez-Créixems M, Alvarado N, Bouza E | year = 2008 | title = Propionibacterium acnes is a common colonizer of intravascular catheters | url = | journal = J Infect | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 257–60 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2008.01.012 | pmid = 18336916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
It is important to note that the human skin is host to numerous bacterial and fungal species, some of which are known to be harmful, some known to be beneficial and the vast majority unresearched. The use of bactericidal and fungicidal soaps will inevitably lead to bacterial and fungal populations which are resistant to the chemicals employed. (see [[Drug resistance]])

===Contagion===
Skin flora do not readily pass between people: 30 seconds of  moderate friction and dry hand contact results in a transfer of only  0.07% of natural hand flora from naked with a greater percentage from gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingaas E, Fagernes M | year = 2009 | title = Development of a method to measure bacterial transfer from hands | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 43–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhin.2009.01.022 | pmid = 19282052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal===
The most effective (60 to 80% reduction) antimicrobial washing is with [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], and [[n-propanol]]. [[Viruses]] are most affected by high (95%) concentrations of ethanol, while bacteria are more affected by  n-propanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kampf G, Kramer A | year = 2004 | title = Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=523567&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 863–93 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.17.4.863-893.2004 | pmid = 15489352 | pmc=523567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmedicated soaps are not very effective as illustrated by the following data. Health care workers washed their hands once in nonmedicated liquid soap for 30 seconds. The students/technicians for 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges LF, Silva BL, Gontijo Filho PP | year = 2007 | title = Hand washing: changes in the skin flora | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 417–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.07.012 | pmid = 17660014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important use of [[hand washing]] is to prevent the [[Nosocomial infection#Transmission|transmission]] of [[antibiotic resistant]] skin flora that cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]. While such flora have become antibiotic resistant due to antibiotics there is no evidence that recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms when used in hand washing.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107–19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many strains of organisms are resistant to some of the substances used in antibacterial soaps such as [[Triclosan]].&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

One survey of [[soap|bar soaps]] in dentist clinics found they all had their own flora and on average from two to five different genera of microorganisms with those used most more likely to have more species varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hegde PP, Andrade AT, Bhat K | year = 2006 | title = Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics | url = http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2006;volume=17;issue=2;spage=70;epage=3;aulast=Hegde | journal = Indian J Dent Res | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 70–3 | pmid = 17051871 | doi=10.4103/0970-9290.29888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey of bar soaps in public toilets found even more flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kabara JJ, Brady MB | year = 1984 | title = Contamination of bar soaps under "in-use" conditions | url = | journal = J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol | volume = 5 | issue = 4–5| pages = 1–14 | pmid = 6394740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that very dry soaps are not infected while all are that rest in pools of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Afolabi BA, Oduyebo OO, Ogunsola FT | year = 2007 | title = Bacterial flora of commonly used soaps in three hospitals in Nigeria | url = | journal = East Afr Med J | volume = 84 | issue = 10| pages = 489–95 | pmid = 18232270 | doi=10.4314/eamj.v84i10.9567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, research upon soap that was specially infected found that soap flora do not transmit to the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinze JE, Yackovich F | year = 1988 | title = Washing with contaminated bar soap is unlikely to transfer bacteria | url = | journal = Epidemiol Infect | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 135–42 | pmid = 3402545 | pmc=2249330 | doi=10.1017/s0950268800029290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damaged skin===
Washing skin repeatedly can damage the protective external layer and cause transepidermal loss of water. This can be seen in roughness characterized by scaling and dryness, itchiness, [[dermatitis]] provoked by microorganisms and [[allergen]]s penetrating the corneal layer and redness. Wearing gloves can cause further problems since it produces a humid environment favoring the growth of microbes and also contains irritants such as [[latex]] and [[talcum powder]].&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larson EL, Hughes CA, Pyrek JD, Sparks SM, Cagatay EU, Bartkus JM | year = 1998 | title = Changes in bacterial flora associated with skin damage on hands of health care personnel | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 513–21 | pmid = 9795681 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand washing can damage skin because the [[stratum corneum]] top layer of skin consists of 15 to 20 layers of [[keratin]] disks, [[corneocyte]]s, each of which is each surrounded by a thin film of skin [[lipid]]s which can be removed by [[alcohol]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kownatzki E | year = 2003 | title = Hand hygiene and skin health | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 239–45 | pmid = 14629966 | doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged skin defined  by extensive cracking of skin surface, widespread reddening or occasional bleeding has also been found to be more frequently colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' and these were more likely to be [[methicillin]] resistant.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt; Though not related to greater antibiotic resistance, damaged skin was also more like to be colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''[[Enterococci]]'' and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;

==Comparison with other flora==
The skin flora is different from that of the gut which is  predominantly [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, Purdom E, Dethlefsen L, Sargent M, Gill SR, Nelson KE, Relman DA | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1395357&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728| pages = 1635–8 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110591 | pmid = 15831718 | pmc=1395357}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also low level of variation between people that is not found in gut studies.&lt;ref name="Grice08"/&gt; Both gut and skin flora however lack the diversity found in [[soil flora]].&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

'''Sociological theories''' are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Edition"/&gt; They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to [[paradigm]]s for analysis and [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]. Some [[sociology|sociological]] theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events,&lt;ref name="What is Sociological Theory?"/&gt; while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002"/&gt;

==Sociological theory vs. social theory==
Kenneth Allan&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; proposed the distinction between sociological theory and [[social theory]]. In Allan's usage, sociological theory consists of abstract and testable propositions about society.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; It often heavily relies on the [[scientific method]], which aims for [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and attempts to avoid passing [[value judgment]]s. In contrast, social theory, according to Allan, focuses on commentary and critique of [[modern society]] rather than explanation.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; Social theory is often closer to [[Continental philosophy]]; thus, it is less concerned with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and derivation of testable propositions, and more likely to pass normative judgments.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

Prominent sociological theorists include [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Randall Collins]], [[James Samuel Coleman]], [[Peter Blau]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Marshal McLuhan]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[George Homans]], [[Harrison White]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Gerhard Lenski]], [[Pierre van den Berghe]] and [[Jonathan H. Turner]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt; Prominent social theorists include: [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger|Roberto Unger]], [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Jeffrey Alexander]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="sanderson"/&gt; There are also prominent scholars who could be seen as being in-between social and sociological theories, such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Herbert Blumer]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

==History of sociological theories==
{{Details|History of sociology}}
The field of [[sociology]] itself–and sociological theory by extension–is relatively new. Both date back to the 18th and 19th centuries. The drastic social changes of that period, such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and the rise of [[democracy|democratic states]] caused particularly Western thinkers to become aware of society. The oldest sociological theories deal with broad historical processes relating to these changes. Since then, sociological theories have come to encompass most aspects of [[society]], including [[community|communities]], [[organization]]s and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-5"/&gt;

==Central theoretical problems==

Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central theoretical questions and the central problems that emerge from explicating such questions. Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change? In the myriad attempts to answer these questions, three predominately theoretical (i.e. not empirical) problems emerge. These problems are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vQbjnVBKRAkC&amp;pg=PP1 Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonization&lt;/ref&gt; [[subjectivity and objectivity]], [[structure and agency]], and [[synchrony and diachrony]]. The first deals with ''knowledge'', the second with ''agency'', and the last with ''time''. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.

===Objectivity and subjectivity===
{{Main|Objectivity (science)|Objectivity (philosophy)|Subjectivity}}

The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is ''[[intersubjectivity]]'' achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description [[in situ]].

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:

{{quote| How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialized and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalized? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject| Pierre Bourdieu|"The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bourdieu, "The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'', 1992, pg 235, 1992, pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Structure and agency===
{{Main|Structure and agency}}
Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SMbNRp5EseMC&amp;pg=PA65 Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach&lt;/ref&gt; form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Giddens, A |title=The Constitution of Society|publisher=University of California Press |location=California |year=1996|pages=14–19|isbn= 978-0-520-05728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A perennial question within this debate is that of "[[social reproduction]]": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

===Synchrony and diachrony===

Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of [[Levi-Strauss]] who inherited it from the linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"&gt;Lizardo, Omar. "Beyond the antinomies of structure: Levi-Strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell." Theory and society 39.6 (2010): 651-688.&lt;/ref&gt; The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyze dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a ''language'', while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual ''speech''. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to ''Central Problems in Social Theory'', he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure...we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of [[social reproduction]]. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyze social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronic. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim.&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.

==Classical theoretical traditions&lt;!--'Classical sociology' and 'Classical social theory' redirect here--&gt;==

The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;Abend, Gabriel. 2008. "The meaning of 'Theory'." Sociological Theory, 26:2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Randall Collins]]' well-cited survey of sociological theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://wur.on.worldcat.org/oclc/782169682|title=Four sociological traditions : selected readings|first=Randall|last=Collins|date=6 May 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=worldcat.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|isbn=9780195087024}}&lt;/ref&gt; he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: functionalism, conflict, symbolic interactionism, and utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2?e=barkbrief-ch01_s03|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World, Brief Edition v1.0  -  FlatWorld|author=|date=|website=flatworldknowledge.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]) theories of social interaction. [[Utilitarianism]], also known as "rational choice" or "social exchange", although often associated with [[economics]], is an established tradition within sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2952549 |title=Archived copy }} Sociological Rational Choice Theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. "Rational choice theory." Nueva York: Sage (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, as argued by [[Raewyn Connell]], a tradition that is often forgotten is that of [[social Darwinism]], which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ_rAAAAMAAJ Southern theory: the global dynamics of knowledge in social science&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Lester F. Ward]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.

===Structural functionalism===
{{Anchor|Functionalism}}
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]] as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Urry |first=John |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogyDBobOHVEC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century |chapter=Metaphors |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-415-19089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |title=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama: Anthropological theories |publisher=As.ua.edu |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105202737/http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]]. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in ''The Giddens Reader'' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
[[Social conflict]] is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources.&lt;ref name="aghababa"/&gt; From the [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=YjGpDAAAQBAJ perspective of social conflict theory], in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists. Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits. In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production. However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians. Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change.&lt;ref name="Sociology"/&gt; Karl Marx is the father of the [[social conflict theory]], which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Other important sociologists associated with this theory include [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Jane Addams]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. This sociological approach doesn't look at how social structures help society to operate, but instead looks at how "social patterns" can cause some people in society to be dominant, and others to be oppressed.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; However, some criticisms to this theory are that it disregards how shared values and the way in which people rely on each other help to unify the society.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism|Dramaturgy (sociology)|Interpretive sociology|Phenomenological sociology}}
[[Symbolic interaction]], often associated with [[interactionism]], [[phenomenological sociology]], [[dramaturgy]], and [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]], is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). Sociology 14th Edition. Boston: Pearson. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-205-11671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, John J. Macionis, Linda M. ''Sociology'' (7th Canadian ed. ed.). Toronto: Pearson Canada. p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-13-700161-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; Some important sociologists associated with this approach include [[Max Weber]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[George Homans]] and [[Peter Blau]]. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of [[Ethnomethodology]] emerges from the work of [[Harold Garfinkel]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{Main| Utilitarianism|Rational choice theory|Exchange theory}}
 
Utilitarianism is often referred to as [[exchange theory]] or [[rational choice theory]] in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by [[Josh Whitford]], rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select amongst the possible alternatives".&lt;ref&gt;"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege" Theory and Society 31 (2002): 325-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of [[George C. Homans]], [[Peter Blau]] and [[Richard Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, R M. "Social Exchange Theory." Annual Review of Sociology 2.1 (1976): 335-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational sociologists [[James G. March]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] noted that an individual's [[bounded rationality|rationality is bounded]] by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] president [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]].

==List of contemporary theories==

[[Anomie theory]] seeks to understand ''[[normlessness]]'', where society provides little moral guidance to individuals.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; Sociologist Emile Durkheim observed that social periods of disruption result in greater anomie and higher rates of suicide and crimes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt; Merton theorizes that [[anomie]] (normative breakdown) and some forms of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] derive largely from a disjunction between “culturally prescribed aspirations” of a society and “socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations". In ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[Durkheim]] described [[anomie]] as one result of an inequitable division of labour within the society. Broadly speaking, then, during times of great upheaval, increasing numbers of individuals "cease to accept the moral legitimacy of society,” as sociologist Anthony R. Mawson, University of Keele, UK, notes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt;

[[Critical theory]] is a lineage of sociological theory, with reference to such groups as the Frankfurt School, that aims to critique and change society and culture, not simply to document and understand it.&lt;ref name="sociology9"/&gt;

[[Dramaturgy (sociology)|Dramaturgy]] or dramaturgical perspective is a specialized symbolic interactionism paradigm developed by [[Erving Goffman]], seeing life as a performance. As "actors," we have a status, which is the part that we play, where we are given various roles.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 16"/&gt; These roles serve as a script, supplying dialogue and action for the characters (the people in reality).&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; They also involve props and certain settings. For instance, a doctor (the role), uses instruments like a heart monitor (the prop), all the while using medical terms (the script), while in his doctor's office (the setting).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; In addition, our performance is the "presentation of self," which is how people perceive us, based on the ways in which we portray ourselves.&lt;ref name="sociology11"/&gt; This process, sometimes called impression management, begins with the idea of personal performance.&lt;ref name="dramaturgical"/&gt;

[[Engaged theory]] is an approach that seeks to understand the complexity of social life through synthesizing empirical research with more abstract layers of analysis, including analysis of modes of practice, and analysis of basic categories of existence such a time, space, embodiment, and knowledge.

[[Feminism]] is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women.&lt;ref name="Feminism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary"/&gt; The theory focuses on how [[gender inequality]] shapes social life.&lt;ref name="New Feminist Sociological Directions"/&gt; This approach shows how sexuality both reflects patterns of [[social inequality]] and helps to perpetuate them. Feminism, from a [[social conflict]] perspective, focuses on gender inequality and links sexuality to the domination of women by men.&lt;ref name="Sociology5"/&gt;

[[Field theory (sociology)|Field theory]] examines social fields, which are social environments in which competition takes place (e.g., the field of electronics manufacturers). It is concerned with how individuals construct such fields, with how the fields are structured, and with the effects the field has on people occupying different positions in it.

[[Grounded theory]] is a systematic methodology in the social sciences involving the generation of theory from data.&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

[[Interpretive sociology]] is a theoretical perspective based on the work of Max Weber, proposes that social, economic and historical research can never be fully empirical or descriptive as one must always approach it with a conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Middle range theory (sociology)|Middle range theory]] is an approach to sociological theorizing aimed at integrating theory and empirical research. It is currently the de facto dominant approach to sociological theory construction, especially in the United States. Middle range theory starts with an empirical phenomenon (as opposed to a broad abstract entity like the social system) and abstracts from it to create general statements that can be verified by data.&lt;ref name="structure"/&gt;

[[Mathematical sociology|Mathematical theory]], also known as formal theory, is the use of [[mathematics]] to construct social theories. Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms. The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref name="formalization"/&gt;

[[Positivism]] is a philosophy developed by [[Auguste Comte]] in the middle of the 19th century that stated that the only authentic knowledge is [[scientific knowledge]], and that such knowledge can only come from positive affirmation of theories through strict [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="educational"/&gt; Society operates according to laws like the physical world. Introspective and [[intuitional]] attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. The positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of [[western thought]], from ancient times to the present day.

[[Network theory]] is a structural approach to sociology that is most closely associated with the work of [[Harrison White]], who views norms and behaviors as embedded in chains of social relations.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Phenomenological sociology]] is an approach within the field of sociology that aims to reveal what role human awareness plays in the production of social action, social situations and social worlds. In essence, phenomenology is the belief that society is a human construction. The social phenomenology of [[Alfred Schütz]] influenced the development of the [[social constructionism]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. It was originally developed by [[Edmund Husserl]].

[[Post-colonial theory]] is a post-modern approach that consists of the reactions to and the analysis of colonialism.

[[Postmodernism]] is a theoretical perspective approach that criticises [[modernism]], instead adhering to anti-theory and anti-method, and has a great mistrust of [[Grand theory|grand theories]] and ideologies. Due to human subjectivity, theorists believe that discovering the objective truth is impossible or unachievable.&lt;ref name="MacionisandGerber2011-10"/&gt; This is due to a perspective that sees society as ever-changing along with the assumption that truth is constantly subject to change. A post-modern theorist's purpose is to achieve understanding through observation, rather than data collection. This approach uses both micro and macro level analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 53"/&gt; A question that is asked by this approach would be, "How do we understand societies or interpersonal relations, while rejecting the theories and methods of the social sciences, and our assumptions about human nature? or How does power permeate social relations or society, and change with the circumstances? "&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; An example of a prominent postmodernist is the French philosopher [[Michael Foucault]].

[[Pure sociology]] is a theoretical paradigm developed by [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] that explains variation in social life with [[social geometry]], that is, locations in social space. A recent extension of this idea is that fluctuations in social space — called social time — are the cause of social conflict.&lt;ref name="Black, Donald 2011"/&gt;

[[Rational choice theory]] models social behavior as the interaction of utility maximizing individuals. "Rational" implies cost-effectiveness is balanced against cost to accomplish a utility maximizing interaction. Costs are extrinsic, meaning intrinsic values such as feelings of guilt will not be accounted for in the cost to commit a crime.

[[Social constructionism]] is a sociological theory of knowledge that considers how social phenomena develop in particular social contexts.&lt;ref name="interpretive"/&gt;

[[Socialization]] theory is an approach to understanding the means by which human infants begin to acquire the skills necessary to perform as a functional member of their society&lt;ref name="sociological"/&gt; Sociologists use the term socialization to refer to the lifelong social experience by which people develop their human potential and learn culture. Unlike other living species, humans need socialization within their cultures for survival.&lt;ref name="Macionis, John J. 2011"/&gt;

[[Social exchange theory]] says that the interaction that occurs between people can be partly based on what someone may "gain and lose" by being with others. For example, when people think about who they may date, they'll look to see if the other person will offer just as much (or perhaps more) than they do. This can include judging an individual's looks and appearance, or their social status.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

[[Thomas theorem]] refers to situations that are defined as real are real in their consequences.&lt;ref name="contemporary"/&gt; Suggests that the reality people construct in their interaction has real consequences for the future. For example, a teacher who believes a certain student to be intellectually gifted may well encourage exceptional academic performance.&lt;ref name="organizational"/&gt;

==Theories in subfields of sociology==

===Criminology===
[[File:Scale of justice 2.svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=text|'''Criminology''' - The scientific study of crime and criminals]]
{{Main|Criminology}}
* The general [[theory of crime]]: States that the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of [[self-control]].
* [[Differential association]] theory: The theory was developed by [[Edwin Sutherland]] and it examines the acts of a criminal from the perspective that they are learned behaviours.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed37"/&gt;
* [[Labeling theory]]: It is the main idea that deviance and conformity result not so much from what people do as from how others respond to these actions.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; It also states that a society's reaction to specific behaviors are a major determinant of how a person may come to adopt a "deviant" label.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed38"/&gt; This theory stresses the relativity of deviance, the idea that people may define the same behavior in any number of ways. Thus the labelling theory is a micro-level analysis and is often classified in the social-interactionist approach.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; Bryant, Lee. [http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/labelling_theory.htm "The Labelling Theory"], History Learning Site, 2000-2012, retrieved March 13, 2013.
* [[Control theory]]: The theory was developed by [[Travis Hirschi]] and it states that a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed39"/&gt;
* [[Rational choice theory]]: States that people commit crimes when it is rational for them to do so according to analyses of costs and benefits, and that crime can be reduced by minimizing benefits and maximizing costs to the "would be" criminal.
* [[Social disorganization theory]]: States that crime is more likely to occur in areas where social institutions are unable to directly control groups of individuals.
* [[Social learning theory]]: States that people adopt new behaviors through observational learning in their environments.&lt;ref name="psychology"/&gt;
* [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain theory]]: States that a social structure within a society may cause people to commit crimes. Specifically, the extent and type of deviance people engage in depend on whether a society provides the means to achieve cultural goals.&lt;ref name="Sociology 14th Edition"/&gt;
* [[Subcultural theory]]: States that behavior is influenced by factors such as class, ethnicity, and family status. This theory's primary focus is on juvenile delinquency.
* [[Psychopath]]: serious criminals who do not feel shame or guilt from their actions. They do not fear punishment and have little sympathy for the people they harm.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed40"/&gt; These individuals are said to have a psychological disorder as psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder. They exhibit a variety of maladaptive traits such as rarely experiencing genuine affection for others. They are skilled at faking affection, are irresponsible, impulsive, tolerate little frustration and they pursue immediate gratification.&lt;ref name="Psychology themes &amp; variations 2nd Canadian Ed"/&gt; Robert Hare, one of the world's leading experts on psychopathy, developed an important assessment device for psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. For many, this measure is the single, most important advancement to date toward what will hopefully become our ultimate understanding of psychopathy (McCann, Weiten, 641).
* [[Containment theory]]: when an individual has a stronger conscience it will make one more tolerable to frustrations and therefore are less likely to be involved in criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;
* [[White-collar crime]]: defined by [[Edwin Sutherland]] as crime committed by persons of high social position in the course of their occupation (Sutherland and Cressey, 1978:44).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; The white-collar crime involves people making use of their occupational position to enrich themselves and others illegally, which often causes public harm.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; In white-collar crime, public harm wreaked by false advertising, marketing of unsafe products, embezzlement, and bribery of public officials is more extensive than most people think, most of which go unnoticed and unpunished.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Corporate crime]]: refers to the illegal actions of a corporation or people acting on its behalf. Corporate crime ranges from knowingly selling faulty or dangerous products to purposely polluting the environment. Like white-collar crime, most cases of corporate crime go unpunished, and many are not never even known to the public.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Organized crime]]: a business that supplies illegal goods or services, including sex, drugs, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; This type of crime expanded among immigrants, who found that society was not always willing to share its opportunities with them.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; A famous example of organized crime is the [[Italian Mafia]].&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Hate crime]]: a criminal act against a person or a person's property by an offender motivated by racial, ethnic, religious or other bias. Hate crimes may refer to race, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation and physical disabilities. According to a [[Statistics Canada]] publication, "Jewish" community has been the most likely the victim of [[hate crime in Canada]] during 2001-2002. Overall, about 57 percent of hate crimes are motivated by ethnicity and race, targeting mainly Blacks and Asians, while 43 percent target religion, mainly Judaism and Islam. A relatively small 9 percent is motivated by sexual orientation, targets gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed41"/&gt;

Physical traits do not distinguish criminals from non criminals, but genetic factors together with environmental factors are strong [[Crime prediction|predictors]] of adult crime and violence.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt; Most psychologists see deviance as the result of "unsuccessful" socialization and abnormality in an individual personality.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;

===Sociology of science and technology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
Sociologists have been active in developing theories about the nature of science and technology:
* "Institutional" sociology of science ([[Robert K. Merton]]) (1960s)
* [[Social construction of technology]] (1980s) − variant of SSK focusing on technology studies
* [[Actor-network theory]] (1980s)
* [[Normalization process theory]] (2000s)
* [[Theories of technology]]

===Social movements===
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=text|[[American Civil Rights Movement]] is one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century. Here, [[Martin Luther King]] is giving his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]
{{Main|Social movement}}
Sociologists have developed various theories about social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Chronologically (by approximate date of origin) they include:
* [[Collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)
* [[Relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)
* [[Value-added theory]] (1960s)
* [[Resource mobilization]]/[[political process]] theory (1970s)
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Frame analysis theory]] (1970s)
* [[New social movement theory]] (1980s)
* New [[cultural theory]] (1990s) — [[James M. Jasper]], [[Jeff Goodwin]] et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17687">'''Soil biology''' is the study of [[Soil microbiology|microbial]] and [[fauna]]l activity and [[ecology]] in [[soil]].
'''Soil life''', '''soil biota''', '''soil fauna''', or '''edaphon''' is a collective term that encompasses all [[organism]]s that spend a significant portion of their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] within a soil profile, or at the  soil-[[plant litter|litter]] interface.
These organisms include [[earthworm]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], different [[arthropod]]s, as well as some reptiles (such as [[snakes]]), and species of burrowing mammals like [[gophers]], [[mole (animal)|moles]] and [[prairie dogs]]. Soil biology plays a vital role in determining many soil characteristics. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter|organic matter]] by soil organisms has an immense influence on soil fertility, [[plant development|plant growth]], [[soil structure]], and [[carbon cycle|carbon storage]]. As a relatively new science, much remains unknown about soil biology and its effect on soil [[ecosystem]]s.

== Overview ==
The soil is home to a large proportion of the world's [[biodiversity]]. The links between soil organisms and soil functions are observed to be incredibly complex. The interconnectedness and complexity of this [[soil food web|soil ‘food web’]] means any appraisal of soil function must necessarily take into account interactions with the living [[community (ecology)|communities]] that exist within the soil. We know that [[soil life|soil organisms]] break down [[organic matter]], making [[nutrient]]s available for uptake by plants and other organisms. The nutrients stored in the bodies of soil organisms prevent nutrient loss by [[leaching (pedology)|leaching]]. Microbial exudates act to maintain [[soil structure]], and [[earthworm]]s are important in [[bioturbation]]. However, we find that we don't understand critical aspects about how these populations function and interact. The discovery of [[glomalin]] in 1995 indicates that we lack the knowledge to correctly answer some of the most basic questions about the [[biogeochemical]] cycle in soils. There is much work ahead to gain a better understanding of the [[ecology|ecological role]] of soil biological components in the [[biosphere]].

In balanced soil, plants grow in an active and steady environment. The [[mineral]] content of the soil and its heartiful [word?] structure are important for their well-being, but it is the life in the earth that powers its cycles and provides its fertility. Without the activities of soil organisms,  [[organic material]]s would accumulate and litter the soil surface, and there would be no food for plants.
The soil biota includes:
*Megafauna: size range - 20&amp;nbsp;mm upward, e.g. [[mole (animal)|moles]], [[rabbit]]s, and [[rodent]]s.
*Macrofauna: size range - 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm, e.g. [[woodlouse|woodlice]], [[earthworm]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[harvestman|harvestmen]].
*[[Soil mesofauna|Mesofauna]]: size range - 100 [[micrometre]]s to 2&amp;nbsp;mm, e.g. [[tardigrade]]s, [[mite]]s and [[springtail]]s.
*[[Microfauna]] and Microflora: size range - 1 to 100 micrometres, e.g. [[yeast]]s, [[bacteria]] (commonly [[actinobacteria]]), [[fungus|fungi]], [[protozoa]], [[roundworm]]s, and [[rotifer]]s.

Of these, bacteria and fungi play key roles in maintaining a healthy soil. They act as [[decomposers]] that break down organic materials to produce [[detritus (biology)|detritus]] and other breakdown products.  Soil [[detritivore]]s, like earthworms, ingest detritus and decompose it. [[Saprotroph]]s, well represented by fungi and bacteria, extract soluble nutrients from delitro.
The ants (macrofaunas) help by breaking down in the same way but they also provide the motion part as they move in their armies. Also the rodents, wood-eaters help the soil to be more absorbent.

&lt;!--
{{:Soil life}} transclusion isnt the real thing here.
--&gt;

== Scope  ==
Soil biology involves work in the following areas:
*[[scientific modelling|Modelling]] of biological processes and [[population dynamics]]
*Soil biology, [[soil physics|physics]] and chemistry: occurrence of physicochemical parameters and surface properties on biological processes and population behavior
*[[Population biology]] and [[molecular ecology]]: methodological development and contribution to study microbial and faunal populations; diversity and [[population dynamics]]; genetic transfers, influence of [[environmental factors]]
*[[Community ecology]] and functioning processes: interactions between organisms and [[mineral]] or [[organic compounds]]; involvement of such interactions in soil [[pathogenicity]]; transformation of mineral and organic compounds, [[biogeochemical cycle|cycling of elements]]; soil structuration

Complementary disciplinary approaches are necessarily utilized which involve [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], ecophysiology, [[biogeography]], ecology, soil processes, organic matter, nutrient dynamics and [[landscape ecology]].

==Bacteria==

[[Bacteria]] are single-cell organisms and the most numerous denizens of agriculture, with populations ranging from 100 million to 3 billion in a gram.  They are
capable of very rapid reproduction by binary fission (dividing into two) in favourable conditions. One bacterium is capable of producing 16 million more in just 24 hours. Most soil bacteria live close to plant roots and are often referred to as rhizobacteria. Bacteria live in soil water, including the film of moisture surrounding soil particles, and some are able to swim by means of [[flagellum|flagella]]. The majority of the beneficial soil-dwelling bacteria need oxygen (and are thus termed [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] bacteria), whilst those that do not require air are referred to as [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], and tend to cause [[putrefaction]] of dead organic matter. Aerobic bacteria are most active in a [[soil]] that is moist (but
not saturated, as this will deprive aerobic bacteria of the air that they require), and neutral [[soil pH]], and where there is plenty of food ([[carbohydrate]]s and [[micronutrient]]s from organic matter) available. Hostile conditions will not completely kill bacteria; rather, the bacteria will stop growing and get into a dormant stage, and those individuals with pro-adaptive [[mutation]]s may compete better in the new conditions.  Some [[gram-positive bacteria]] produce spores in order to wait for more favourable circumstances, and [[gram-negative bacteria]] get into a "nonculturable" stage. Bacteria are colonized by persistent viral agents ([[bacteriophage]]s) that determine gene word order in bacterial host.

From the organic gardener's point of view, the important roles that bacteria play are:


[[Image:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The nitrogen cycle]]

===Nitrification===

[[Nitrification]] is a vital part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], wherein certain bacteria (which manufacture their own [[carbohydrate]] supply without using the process of photosynthesis) are able to transform [[nitrogen]] in the form of [[ammonium]], which is produced by the decomposition of [[protein]]s, into [[nitrate]]s, which are available to growing plants, and once again converted to proteins.

===Nitrogen fixation===

In another part of the cycle, the process of [[nitrogen fixation]] constantly puts additional nitrogen into biological circulation. This is carried out by free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil or water such as ''[[Azotobacter]]'', or by those that live in close symbiosis with [[legume|leguminous]] plants, such as [[rhizobia]]. These bacteria form colonies in nodules they create on the roots of [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s, and related species. These are able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into nitrogen-containing organic substances.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;

===Denitrification===

While nitrogen fixation converts nitrogen from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] into organic compounds, a series of processes called [[denitrification]] returns an approximately equal amount of nitrogen to the atmosphere.  Denitrifying bacteria tend to be anaerobes, or facultatively anaerobes (can alter between the oxygen dependent and oxygen independent types of metabolisms), including ''[[Achromobacter]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''. The purification process caused by oxygen-free conditions converts nitrates and nitrites in soil into nitrogen gas or into gaseous compounds such as [[nitrous oxide]] or [[nitric oxide]]. In excess, denitrification can
lead to overall losses of available soil nitrogen and subsequent loss of soil fertility.  However, fixed nitrogen may circulate many times between organisms and the soil
before denitrification returns it to the atmosphere. The diagram above illustrates the nitrogen cycle.

===Actinobacteria===

[[Actinobacteria]] are critical in the decomposition of [[organic matter]] and in [[humus]] formation, and their presence is responsible for the sweet "earthy" aroma associated with a good healthy soil.  They require plenty of air and a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, but are more tolerant of dry conditions than most other bacteria and fungi.

==Fungi==

A gram of garden soil can contain around one million [[fungus|fungi]], such as [[yeast]]s and [[mould]]s.  Fungi have no [[chlorophyll]], and are not able to [[photosynthesis]]e. They cannot use atmospheric carbon dioxide as a source of carbon, therefore they are [[chemoorganoheterotrophy|chemo-heterotrophic]], meaning that, like [[animal]]s, they require a chemical source of energy rather than being able to use light as an energy source, as well as organic substrates to get carbon for growth and development.

Many fungi are parasitic, often causing disease to their living host plant, although some have beneficial relationships with living plants, as illustrated below. In terms of soil and humus creation, the most important fungi tend to be [[saprotrophic]]; that is, they live on dead or decaying organic matter, thus breaking it down and converting it to forms that are available to the higher plants. A succession of fungi species will colonise the dead matter, beginning with those that use sugars and starches, which are succeeded by those that are able to break down [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]s.

Fungi spread underground by sending long thin threads known as [[mycelium]] throughout the soil; these threads can be observed throughout many soils and [[compost]] heaps. From the mycelia the fungi is able to throw up its fruiting bodies, the visible part above the soil (e.g., [[mushroom]]s, [[toadstool]]s, and [[puffball]]s), which may contain millions of [[spore]]s.  When the [[fruiting body]] bursts, these spores are dispersed through the air to settle in
fresh environments, and are able to lie dormant for up to years until the right conditions for their activation arise or the right food is made available.

===Mycorrhizae===

Those fungi that are able to live symbiotically with living plants, creating a relationship that is beneficial to both, are known as [[Mycorrhiza]]e (from ''myco'' meaning fungal and ''rhiza'' meaning root).  Plant root hairs are invaded by the mycelia of the mycorrhiza, which lives partly in the soil and partly in the root, and may either cover the length of the root hair as a sheath or be concentrated around its tip. The mycorrhiza obtains the carbohydrates that it requires from the root, in return providing
the plant with nutrients including nitrogen and moisture. Later the plant roots will also absorb the mycelium into its own tissues.

Beneficial mycorrhizal associations are to be found in many of our edible and flowering crops.  [[Shewell Cooper]] suggests that these include at least 80% of the ''[[brassica]]'' and ''[[solanum]]'' families (including [[tomato]]es and [[potato]]es), as well as the majority of [[tree]] species, especially in [[forest]] and woodlands. Here the mycorrhizae create a fine underground mesh that extends greatly beyond the limits of the tree's roots, greatly increasing their feeding range and actually causing neighbouring trees to become physically interconnected. The benefits of mycorrhizal relations to their plant partners are not limited to nutrients, but can be essential for plant reproduction: In situations where little light is able to reach the forest floor, such as the North American [[pine tree|pine]] forests, a young seedling cannot obtain sufficient light to photosynthesise for itself and will not grow properly in a sterile soil. But, if the ground is underlain by a mycorrhizal mat, then the developing seedling will throw down roots that can link with the fungal threads and through them obtain the nutrients it needs, often indirectly obtained from its parents or neighbouring trees.

[[David Attenborough]] points out the plant, fungi, animal relationship that creates a "Three way harmonious trio" to be found in forest [[ecosystem]]s, wherein the plant/fungi symbiosis is enhanced by animals such as the wild boar, deer, mice, or flying squirrel, which feed upon the fungi's fruiting bodies, including truffles, and cause their further spread (''Private Life Of Plants'', 1995).  A greater understanding of the complex relationships that pervade natural systems is one of the major justifications of the [[Organic gardening|organic gardener]], in refraining from the use of artificial chemicals and the damage these might cause.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Recent research has shown that [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l fungi produce [[glomalin]], a protein that binds soil particles and stores both carbon and nitrogen.  These glomalin-related soil proteins are an important part of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=usda02/&gt;

==Earthworms, ants, and termites==
Earthworms, ants and termites mix the soil as they burrow, significantly affecting soil formation. Earthworms ingest soil particles and organic residues, enhancing the availability of plant nutrients in the material that passes through and out their bodies. By aerating and stirring the soil, and by increasing the stability of soil aggregates, these organisms help assure the ready infiltration of water.

The term '''somatic''' is often used in biology to refer to the cells of the body in contrast to the germ line cells which usually give rise to the [[gamete]]s ([[ovum]] or [[sperm]]). These [[somatic cell]]s are [[diploid]] containing two copies of each [[chromosome]], whereas the germ cells are [[haploid]] as they only contain one copy of each chromosome. Although under normal circumstances all somatic cells in an organism contain identical [[DNA]], they develop a variety of tissue-specific characteristics. This process is called [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], through [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] and regulatory alterations. The grouping of like cells and tissues creates the foundation for organs.

[[Somatic mutation]]s are changes to the genetics of a multi-cellular organism which are not passed on to its offspring through the germ-line. Many [[cancer]]s are somatic mutations.

Somatic is also defined as relating to the wall of the body cavity, particularly as distinguished from the head, limbs or [[Viscus|viscera]].

It is also used in the term [[somatic nervous system]] which is the portion of the [[vertebrate]] [[nervous system]] which regulates voluntary movements of the body.
==Mutation frequency==

The frequency of [[mutation]]s in mouse somatic tissue ([[brain]], [[liver]], [[Sertoli cell]]s) was compared to the mutation frequency in male [[germline]] cells at sequential stages of [[spermatogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

{{Reading}}
 
"[[Phonics]]" emphasizes the [[alphabetic principle]] – the idea that letters represent the sounds of speech, and that there are systematic and predictable relationships between written letters and spoken words, which is specific to the [[alphabetic]] [[writing system]] Children learn letter sounds (b = the first sound in "bat" and "ball") first and then blend them (bl = the first two sounds in "blue") to form words.  Children also learn how to segment and chunk letter sounds together in order to blend them to form words (trap = /t/, /r/, /a/, /p/ or /tr/, /ap/).  

"[[Whole language]]" is a [[Reading education|method of teaching reading]] that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. Students are taught to use critical thinking strategies and to use context to "guess" words that they do not recognize. In the younger grades, children use invented spelling to write their own stories. 

Both instructional methods use elements that are emphasized in the other; the differences between the methods are largely related to what is emphasized and the sequence of skill instruction.

==Phonics==
{{Main|Phonics}}

Phonics is seen to be an improvement  used method of learning the approximate [[phoneme|sounds]] represented by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s (b=buh) first and then blending them with other sounds (bl=bluh) to decode and encode words in written form. This newer method attempts to eliminate the extraneous "uh" sounds which were unavoidable in the older method. Children also learn strategies to figure out words they don't know. 

Phonics is considered an "analytical" approach where students analyze the letters, letter combinations and syllables in a word; in an effort to "decode" (1) the speech-sounds represented by the letters and (2) the meaning of the text. The advantage of phonics is that, especially for students who come to schools with large English vocabularies, it enables students to decode or "sound-out" a word they have in their speaking vocabulary. 

Phonics proponents led by [[Rudolf Flesch]] in his book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' attacked the whole word approach because (1) it did not get students into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled vocabularies and (2) it theoretically required the students to memorize every word as a whole. 

Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades and emphasize the importance of students having [[phonemic awareness]], that is an understanding of the alphabetic principle that the spelling of words relates to how they sound when spoken. 

A problem with teaching the reading of English with this analytical approach is that English words do not have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier.  In general, with a few common exceptions, the [[consonant]]s do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the [[vowel]]s do not. For instance the letter "a" represents one sound in the word "s'''a'''y", a second sound in "'''a'''t", a third sound in "'''a'''ny", a fourth sound in "'''a'''re", a fifth sound in "'''a'''ll", a sixth sound in "'''a'''bout", a seventh sound in "f'''a'''ther", an eighth sound in "or'''a'''nge", and a ninth sound (silence) in "bre'''a'''d". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter. 

Almost any combination of three letters with a central "a" can reasonably be pronounced in a number of different ways. For instance the "a" in "pag" could be pronounced as in "page" (long "a"), "pageant" (short "a"), creepage (short "i") or decoupage (short "o" as in "dot"). It therefore follows that beginning students will have a difficult time picking the appropriate sound when sounding-out words which are not in their speaking vocabularies.

Fortunately, most readers quickly develop a subconscious word sense which helps them fluently pick the right sound based on the structure of the word and how that structure is related to other similar words they know.

Some very common words do not fully follow common phonic patterns, so those words have to be memorized. Some books refer to these words as "[[sight word]]s", but it is probably better to refer to them as "memory words" because some books refer to sight words as those words which are so common they do not have to be analyzed or "sounded-out". It does not seem like a good idea to have "sight-words" mean two different things when "memory-words" is available.

The many [[homonym]]s in English such as ''to'', ''too'', and ''two'' create difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling. 

'''Drawbacks''': 
*For those who learn to speak by learning the whole sound of a word, phonics is not an ideal form of reading instruction, because these learners do not naturally break words into separate sounds.
*Some phonics programs use low-interest reading material and too many boring worksheets. Those "drawbacks", of course, are not unique to a phonics program.

==Whole language==
{{Main|Whole language}}

'''Whole language''' is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading that is based on constructivist learning theory and ethnographic studies of students in classrooms. With whole language, teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their students and to combine [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[listening]], [[reading (activity)|reading]], and [[writing]]. Whole language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters, and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language classroom. 
Whole language is considered a "[[wikt:top-down|top down]]" approach where the reader constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they are reading.

'''Drawbacks''': 
*Some whole language programs place too little emphasis on word analysis. When that is left out, young readers may guess or skip over words they don't know and some children may not learn how to read.
*Some scholars have estimated that a whole-word memorization approach puts severe limitations on the number of words that children can learn to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane McGuinness|McGuinness, Diane]]. [http://www.rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 A Prototype for Teaching the English Alphabet Code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624011617/http://rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 |date=2008-06-24 }} Reading Reform Foundation Newsletter (49) &lt;!--accessed August 5, 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who come from "high literacy" households—where young children are read bedtime stories on a regular basis, there are lots of children's books, and adults read regularly—tend to learn to read well regardless of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (and sometimes they already can read). 

Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies. They may speak non-standard dialects of English such as [[African American Vernacular English]] and can be unmotivated students, especially if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act, in other words their language and culture. It can be argued that a standard phonics approach might be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students' language and culture. Using culturally relevant material within classrooms may assist to engage these students in their reading. In addition, knowing students and how they learn will assist as topics of interest can be incorporated into their reading material for added motivation.

Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are including systematic phonics instruction (see [[synthetic phonics]]), more classic and popular children's literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests of their students. 

Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently. The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] while the whole language emphasis draws from cognitivist learning theory and the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. 

Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task. 

Cognitivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it ([[rote learning]]), but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning. 

Vygotsky identified a '''"[[zone of proximal development]]"''' where children can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

A '''whimbling iron''' is a [[bell clapper]] made from [[ductile iron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ductile.org/didata/default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally bell clappers were standard cast [[grey iron]] with a razor-like crystalline structure that led to sudden catastrophic failure over time. The standard clapper is distinguished by the experienced ear as a whefting iron.  Whilst some believe that the advent of "health and safety" led to the search for an alternative, it is more likely that the ability to forge the bottom end ready for use practically died out early in [[World War II]].  Some attempts at composite clappers were made, but advances in casting technology, driven as much by the motor industry as by the war, resulted in the adoption of spheroidal graphite iron castings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=21]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zambia Forestry College (ZFC) was established in 1949 to provide technical training in forestry. In the same year it produced the first forest guards.

In the following year, Forest Rangers were trained. The College has since been growing to cope with the changing demand for natural resource trained staff. By 1963, over 300 Forest Rangers (Certificate holders) and Forest Guards had been trained.

Training for Foresters (Diploma holders) commenced in 1963 with nine (9) students.  By the end of 1977, 131 Foresters and one (1) female Forester completed her training successfully signifying that this field was gender friendly. The college has now been upgraded with equipment, facilities and staff.
