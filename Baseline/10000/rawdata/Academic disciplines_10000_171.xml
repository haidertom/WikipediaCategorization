'''Antithetic parallelism''' is a form of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] where the meaning of two or more excerpts of text are observed, although directly linked by providing the same meaning from differing perspectives. This type of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] is used in order to create repetition of meaning as a technique for cognitive reinforcement, thus more effectively communicating the meaning of the text.

== Examples ==

Examples of antithetic parallelism are found in [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Antithetical Structure in Biblical Hebrew Poetry | last1=Krašovec | first1=Jože | isbn=9789004275584 | year=1984 | doi=10.1163/9789004275584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Psalms]] of the Bible:

The young lions lack and suffer hunger;
&lt;br /&gt;
But those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing. ([[Psalms]] 34:10)

More specifically, antithetical parallelism is defined as text where the meaning in the first part of the [[couplet]] contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In [[poetry]] the use of opposites can bring a sharper contrast to an image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.

Antithetic parallelism is not to be confused with 'synonymous' or 'synthetic' [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]], which reflect repeated and expansive ideas respectively.

'''CIDOB''', acronym of the '''Barcelona Centre for International Affairs''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[think-tank]] based in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], dedicated to research and divulge contents of the different areas of international relations and development studies. The centre defines itself as an organisation that is «an independent, non partisan centre that contributes to ongoing international debates from the perspective of a major Mediterranean metropolis».&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/cidob|title=Strategic vision 2010-2013|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally speaking, CIDOB is a '''public foundation''' with a Board of Trustees that includes among its members the main political institutions and universities of Catalonia and Barcelona, in addition to a number of ministries of the Spanish Government. CIDOB is currently the oldest think-tank in Spain, and one of the most influential in its field, so they claim.

== The acronym ''CIDOB'' and the centre’s name ==
The centre's original name was, from 1973 onwards, ''Centre d'Informació i Documentació Internacionals a Barcelona'' (translated into English, ''Barcelona Centre for International Information and Documentation''), thus giving rise to the acronym CIDOB. Later on, the centre was referred with other names, including ''Centro de Relaciones Internacionales y Cooperación Internacional'' (''Centre of International Relations and International Cooperation''), ''Centro de Investigación de Relaciones Internacionales y Desarrollo'' (''Research Centre on International Relations and Development'') and, particularly over the years and until 2013, ''Centro de Estudios y Documentación Internacionales de Barcelona'' (''Barcelona Centre for International Studies and Documentation''). These titles still appear in quotes and references from other media, thereby creating certain confusion. Since 2013 the official name, in all cases and without translations, uses the English form '''''Barcelona Centre for International Affairs'''''. All these names  no longer correspond to the historical acronym, though it has always been used exclusively to refer to the organisation.

== History ==
CIDOB was born in 1973 as a non-profit-making association of socio-cultural nature based on the personal experience of its founder, Josep Ribera i Pinyol, one of the promoters of the Catalan inter-diocesan movement ''Agermanament'' (''Brothering''), which was active in cooperation projects with countries in Africa and South America. This original CIDOB was known as ''CIDOB Tercer Mundo'' (''CIDOB Third World'') or ''CIDOB-TM''. In 1979, as a result of the political transformations succeeded in Catalonia and Spain, and upon a desire to «energise the democratic fabric with respect to international cooperation»,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/la_municipal/59/entrevista.htm |title=Josep Ribera, director de la Fundació CIDOB, reflexiona sobre la cooperació internacional|publisher=Revista La Municipal nº 59, Ayuntamiento de Barcelona|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIDOB was legally constituted as a private foundation with a Board of Trustees, whose members, public and private, were representatives of the political and cultural life of Catalonia and Spain. Currently, the foundation is public.

In the following years, CIDOB grew up to become a research and document center focused on international issues and global problems such as human development, and pursuing to become a major framework able to connect Catalan reality with that of the rest of the world. With this aim in mind, CIDOB has taken full advantage of Barcelona's prominence as a Euro-Mediterranean capital that also has special links with Latin America. Since the 1990s, the centre has strengthened its networking connections with European initiatives on issues concerning cooperation, international relations and security, as well as its academic activities, oriented toward the generation of ideas and specific political action.&lt;ref name="jordi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/noticias/cidob/nuevo_director_de_la_fundacion_cidob |title=Nuevo director de la Fundación CIDOB |date=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406221417/http://www.cidob.org/es/noticias/cidob/nuevo_director_de_la_fundacion_cidob |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josep Ribera continued to head CIDOB until December 2008, when he chose to step down after 35 years at the helm. His successor as director was, by decision of the Foundation's Board of Trustees, Jordi Vaquer i Fanés, an International Relations doctor and researcher at CIDOB to that moment.&lt;ref name="jordi" /&gt; [[Narcís Serra|Narcís Serra i Serra]], former mayor of Barcelona, former minister in the [[Spanish Government]] and one-time leader of the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|Catalan Socialists]], chaired the Foundation from 2000 to May 2012, when was succeeded by economist Carles A. Gasòliba i Böhm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/cidob_renews_its_board_of_trustees_and_appoints_carles_a_gasoliba_as_president |title=CIDOB renews its Board of Trustees and appoints Carles A.

In June 2013 the Board of Trustees selected a new director, Dr. Jordi Bacaria i Colom, currently co-director of the Institute of European Integration Studies (IEIE) in Mexico and editor of the journal ''Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/the_board_of_cidob_appoints_dr_jordi_bacaria_as_director |title=The Board of CIDOB appoints Dr. Jordi Bacaria as director |date=June 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024000835/http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/the_board_of_cidob_appoints_dr_jordi_bacaria_as_director |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation and installations ==
[[image:CarlesGasoliba.jpg|thumb|Carles A. Gasòliba, current president of CIDOB.|right|200px]]

===Staff===
The Foundation is headed by its chairman, Carles A. Gasòliba. The centre itself consists of a management team made up of the director, Jordi Bacaria, an executive coordinator, Anna Estrada, a managing director and a coordinator for Research (Eduard Soler). The working staff is made up of researchers and specific staff responsible for the sections of information &amp; web services, publications, activities, press and administration. As of June 2013, 30 people work at CIDOB.

===Board of Trustees===
The  Foundation's Board is made up of the following institutional trustees, whose financial contributions represent most of the centre's annual budget:

* [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]
* Barcelona City Council
* Barcelona Provincial Council
* Barcelona Metropolitan Area.
* [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]]
* [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Defence]]
* Interuniversity Council of Catalonia.

=== Installations ===
[[File:Capella dels Infants Orfes (I).jpg|Casa dels Infants Orfes|thumb|160px|right]]
CIDOB’s offices are divided between two historic buildings – nearby but not adjoining – on calle Elisabets in Barcelona's [[Raval]] district, very close to [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]] and [[Plaça de Catalunya]]. They are Casa de la Misericòrdia (Elisabets, 12) and Casa dels Infants Orfes (Elisabets, 24).

The '''Casa de la Misericòrdia''' has, since 1988, housed the centre's main installations, including the official head office, the archives and library, as well as Sala Maragall, the hall used for events. Originally, the building (which includes the old church) formed part of the School of [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine|St William of Aquitaine]], founded by the [[Augustine Order]] in 1587, and later on it was used as a municipal primary school. During the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion]] it served as clandestine headquarters of the citizen's movement against the French occupation. In more recent times, in 1910, it became the home of the Institute of Culture and People's Library for Women; later still, in 1940, the building became the head office of the Institute for Theatre, as well as being home to the Adrià Gual Chair.

The '''Casa dels Infants Orfes''' also dates back to the 16th century. It was built as the head office of the institution founded by Guillem dez Pou in 1370 to provide a home for orphans in the Diocese of Barcelona. It has an adjacent chapel, commissioned by Claudi Cosal in 1680 and redesigned in 1785. Among the building’s later uses, it was a school run by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] (1848) and a convent for the [[Carmelites|Carmelites of Charity]] (1875). The chapel lost all its religious furnishings and fittings during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

== Activities ==

=== Fields of specialisation and events ===
Over the past decade, CIDOB has systematised its areas of research, by maintaining its traditional subjects/regions of interest and adding other, more specific ones. Currently, CIDOB operates three major programmes: ''People and Frontiers''; ''A more secure life''; and ''Democratic Governance''. Under these generic premises, research works cover both thematic and geographical areas. In the first group major topics are: Development; Environment; Energy; Human Security; Intercultural Dynamics; Migrations; Conflicts; Local Government; State, Democracy and Foreign Policy; and Regionalism. CIDOB has a particular focus on «six fields of excellence»,&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt; namely: European Foreign Policy and Neighborhood Relations ; Security Sector Reform; Intercultural Dynamics; Migration Policy in Europe; International relations of cities and regions; and EU Enlargement.

As for geographical specialisation, CIDOB follows in particular political issues from Europe (including the [[USSR|post-Soviet realm]]), the Mediterranean and Middle East, Latin America and Asia ([[Central Asia]] in special). Four regional powers, one in each continent, receive priority: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt; The international political situation, the world human development indicators and the Spanish international cooperation and foreign relations are also monitored on an ongoing basis.

At structural level, eight «issues-regions» are defined at the moment: Asia; Development; Europe; Intercultural Dynamics; Latin America; Mediterranean and Middle East; Migrations; and Security. Each issue-region is directed by a researcher or senior research fellow who works with other analysts, assistants, associate or visiting specialists and external contributors. Some programmes also have a projects manager. Research teams work with interdisciplinary scholar networks and generate their own academic activities, publications and documentary collections.

CIDOB’s research work is conceived to be disseminated as widely as possible, and thus it's aimed not only at specialists and scholars, but also at public organisations, mass media, NGOs, businesses, university students and public in general. Direct dissemination requires seminars, conferences, debates and workshops. Also, CIDOB regularly announces calls for papers, issues policy papers and introduces new publications. In its own words, CIDOB's vision consists of «promoting good global governance based on democratic practices at the local, national and supranational level in order to ensure people’s basic needs for freedom and a life without fear». Meanwhile, the centre's mission is to «offer information and ideas that help to shape policies that promote a safer, freer and more just world for all».&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt;

Every year, CIDOB and the City Council of Barcelona jointly hold the international seminar '''''War and Peace in the 21st Century''''', a series of debates attended by leading personalities from public function, governments and international academia. Other important annual events include the '''''International Seminar on Security and Defence in the Mediterranean''''', organised jointly with the Spanish Institute for Strategic Studies (IEEE, which reports to the Spanish Ministry of Defence), and the '''''Seminar on the Ibero-American Development Agenda''''' (ADI), run with the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) and the [[Ibero-American General Secretariat]] (SEGIB). These three seminars have been held since 2002, 2002 and 2005 respectively at the [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes|Palace of Pedralbes]] in Barcelona.

=== Publications ===
CIDOB edits and publishes a wide range of analytical and documentary stuff in different formats, in print edition and online.

=== Teaching and IBEI ===
Since 1989, CIDOB provided training programmes for university postgraduate students, in collaboration with the University of Barcelona. The courses available were:

* Diploma in Development Cooperation.
* Diploma in International Relations.
* Master in International Studies.
* Master in Development Studies.

Currently, CIDOB's teaching activities take place within the academic programmes of the '''[[Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals]]''' (Barcelona Institute for Studies International, '''IBEI'''), a private foundation created by CIDOB in March 2004, whose members included the five Catalan universities (UB, UAB, UPC, UPF and UOC) sat in the Board of Trustees of CIDOB. This inter-university institute offers two postgraduate courses: Master in International Relations and the Erasmus Mundus Masters Programme in Public Policy (Mundus MAPP); the latter is provided in association with the [[Central European University]] (CEU) of [[Budapest]], the [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) of Rotterdam and the [[University of York]]. The IBEI also holds two summer courses: Barcelona Summer School in International Politics and the Summer School of the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, CIDOB was a member of the network of organising centres for the Master en Affaires Euro-Méditerranéennes/Master in Euro-Mediterranean Affairs (MAEM-MEMA).

=== Documentation, BIBA and information services ===
Since it was founded, one of CIDOB’s basic services has been the maintenance of an extensive documentary collection specializing mainly in international relations and development, which is open to the public. These documentary and bibliographical collections are collectively known as the '''Biblioteca Internacional de Barcelona''' (International Library of Barcelona, '''BIBA'''); the library was created to support the teaching and research activities done by CIDOB and IBEI, as well as to provide a service to the university and research community as a whole, to journalists and other professional people interested in the subject.
 
At present, CIDOB's documentation, library and information area is organised for users into four sections:

==== Documentation Centre and Library ====
The '''Library''' contains a documentary collection specialized in international relations and development, particularly in the geographical and subject areas deemed to be priorities for CIDOB. The documents are the following: the approximately 400 international periodical publications to which CIDOB is a subscriber; another 600 titles that are no longer received; more than 12,000 volumes and monographs; and a further 11,000 documents in other formats. The Library also contains all the publications published by the Foundation. The online catalogue for the documentary collection enables users to browse lists of all the items acquired since 1985.

The '''Documentation Centre''' analyses the periodical publications that it receives in accordance with a list of its own descriptors, as well as managing specific databases of periodical publications and acronyms. The Documentation Centre also helps to create documentary appendices for some of CIDOB's own publications.

==== Digital Library ====
Set up in 2011, this is an online database with a search engine that enables users to access all content produced by CIDOB: maps, chronologies, acronyms, biographies, news and activities, dossiers, articles and monographs on subjects under study.

==== Dossiers CIDOB ====
A non-periodical online publication focusing on international political current affairs. The Dossiers are monographic studies of specific events of a national or international scope, created by the centre's researchers and information specialists. They contain analytical articles produced by CIDOB, links to external articles and news items, and to official reference documents, as well as to support material produced ex profeso. This information tool has been available exclusively through the Web since 2009.

==== Biographies of Political Leaders ====
Biographical information service, online since 2001. Country leaders’ profiles are situated «in context», by presenting and explaining the historical, political, economic and social circumstances surrounding them. At present (2011), this Web service features more than 600 biographies of political leaders from around the world. As with the Dossiers, the texts are designed so that they can be updated at any time.

=== Affiliations, agreements and collaboration projects ===
CIDOB maintains an extensive network of memberships and affiliations with academic organisations in Spain and abroad. These include: Spanish Council for Ibero-American Studies (CEEIB); [[European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes]] (EADI); European Information Network on International Relations and Area Studies (EINIRAS); Europe's Forum on International Cooperation (EUFORIC); Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission (EUROMESCO); [[International Peace Research Association]] (IPRA); [[International Studies Association]] (ISA); [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA); One World Online; and the [[REDIAL|European Network of Information and Documentation on Latin America]] (REDIAL).

CIDOB also has collaboration agreements with the following institutions and centres: Agència Catalana de Cooperació; [[Banco Santander Central Hispano]]; [[British Council]]; Barcelona Chamber of Commerce; Casa Amèrica Catalunya; Casa Árabe; Casa Asia; Diputació de Barcelona; [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC); Diplomatic School of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; [[Fundación Global Democracia y Desarrollo]] (FUNGLODE); Spanish Institute for Strategic Studies (IEEE); European Institute of the Mediterranean (IEMed); University Institute of European Studies of the Autonomous University of Barcelona; Spanish Ministry of Culture; Spanish Ministry of Defence; Real Instituto Elcano; Autonomous University of Barcelona.

Some of CIDOB’s agreements and affiliations have generated specific products and services aimed at the general public:

* Access to the '''BIBA''' for students at the IBEI.
* In association with IEMed, CIDOB published the above-mentioned '''''Mediterranean Yearbook''''' between 2004 and 2008.
* Within the framework of the '''EINIRAS Database Network''' (EDN), CIDOB publishes a database of articles from online periodical publications.
* Together with Casa Asia and Real Instituto Elcano, the centre manages the '''Observatory on Central Asia''' (OAC), set up in 2007* Together with IEEE, CIDOB manages the web portal '''Security and Defence in the Mediterranean''' (SEDMED).

Likewise, CIDOB (together with seven other international research centres from countries in Europe) participates in the academic consortium '''EU4SEAS Project''', a research network on cooperation based around the Black, Baltic, Caspian and Mediterranean seas, and which is funded by the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development of the European Union]]. CIDOB also contributes to the '''Migrant Integration Policy Index III''' (MIPEX III) and, as mentioned above, organises the '''Ibero-American Development Agenda''' (ADI), together with ECLAC.

== Social influence ==
In 2009, [[Iberglobal]] – the portal for the internationalisation of business and the economy – ranked CIDOB third in a list of the ''most influential think-tanks in Spain''. The centre was given 158 votes out of 1,313 in a survey of just over 500 readers. Fifteen Spanish think-tanks were evaluated in the poll; among them, the Elcano Institute and the Foundation for International Relations and Exterior Dialogue( FRIDE) were ranked first and second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iberglobal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=511:los-think-tanks-mas-importantes-de-espana&amp;catid=38&amp;Itemid=74|title=Los think tanks más importantes de España |language=Spanish|work=iberglobal.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 edition of Global Go-to Think-Tanks - the prestigious list of think-tanks around the world issued by the international relations program of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] - assessed 4,567 centres from around the world and placed CIDOB 37th out of the 50 best non-US think-tanks, in the category ''Top 50 Think-Tanks – Worldwide (Non-US)''. In this list, the Barcelona centre was the only one from Spain and the third from southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2010GlobalGoToReport_ThinkTankIndex_UNEDITION_15_.pdf
|title=The Global "Go-To Think Tanks"|publisher=Go to think tank}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2012 edition, CIDOB has been recognized as the most influential think tank in Southern Europe. This time CIDOB was ranked 18th in the top 75 think tanks from Western Europe, 35th in the worldwide non-US category, and 64th among the 150 top think tanks worldwide, US and non US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-Global-Go-To-Think-Tank-Report.pdf|title=The Global "Go-To Think Tanks"|publisher=Go to think tank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, CIDOB Foundation received the Lluís Carulla Honour Award, a prize it shared with Professor Ramon Sugranyes i de Franch.

'''Biodegradation''' is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]], [[fungi]].{{efn| The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines biodegradation as "degradation caused by enzymatic process resulting from the action of cells" and notes that the definition is "modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schué F | title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377–410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Biodegradation| vauthors = Focht DD | work = AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.422025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and assimilation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Biodeterioration is a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to abiotic factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material's structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature, and chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas N, Bienaime C, Belloy C, Queneudec M, Silvestre F, Nava-Saucedo JE | title = Polymer biodegradation: mechanisms and estimation techniques | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–42 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18723204 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muller|first=Rolf-Joachim | editor-first =  Alexander | editor-last = Steinbüchel | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Biodegradability of Polymers: Regulations and Methods for Testing |title=Biopolymers |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30290-1 | chapter-url = https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/biopoly/pdf_v10/vol10_19.pdf | doi = 10.1002/3527600035.bpola012 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofragmentation of a polymer is the lytic process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating oligomers and monomers in its place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is aerobic digestion, and the breakdown of materials when is oxygen is not present is anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polimernet.com/Docs/Aerobic%20-%20Anaerobic%20Biodegredation%20en.pdf|title=Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodegradation| work = Fundementals of Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Biodegradation Process | publisher = Polimernet Plastik San. Tic. Ltd. Şti. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between these processes is that anaerobic reactions produce methane, while aerobic reactions do not (however, both reactions produce carbon dioxide, water, some type of residue, and a new biomass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.library.wur.nl/193543|title=Analytical Methods for Monitoring Biodegradation Techniques|last=Van der Zee|first=Maarten | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, aerobic digestion typically occurs more rapidly than anaerobic digestion, while anaerobic digestion does a better job reducing the volume and mass of the material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to anaerobic digestion's ability to reduce the volume and mass of waste materials and produce a natural gas, anaerobic digestion technology is widely used for  waste management systems and as a source of local, renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Klinkner | first = Blake Anthony | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anaerobic Digestion as a Renewable Energy Source and Waste Management Technology: What Must be Done for this Technology to Realize Success in the United States? | url = https://scholarship.law.umassd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=umlr | journal = University of Massachusetts Law Review | volume = 9 | pages = 68–96 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into microbial cells, this is the assimilation stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by membrane carriers. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter catabolic pathways that either lead to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or elements of the cells structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==
In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs. Factors include [[light]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] and temperature.&lt;ref name="pmid29972726"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haider T, Völker C, Kramm J, Landfester K, Wurm FR | title = Plastics of the future? The impact of biodegradable polymers on the environment and on society | journal = Angewandte Chemie (International Ed. In English) | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29972726 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201805766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation rate of many organic compounds is limited by their bioavailability, which is the rate at which a substance is absorbed into a system or made available at the site of physiological activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bioavailability|title=Definition of BIOAVAILABILITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as compounds must be released into solution before organisms can degrade them.The rate of biodegradation can be measured in a number of ways. [[Respirometry]] tests can be used for [[aerobic microbes]]. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Andy | last = Jessop | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://commercialwaste.trade/how-is-biodegradability-measured/ |title=How is biodegradability measured? |date=2015-09-16 |work=Commercial Waste |access-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s important to note factors that effect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable. Several materials will test as being biodegradable under optimal conditions in a lab for approval but these results may not reflect real world outcomes where factors are more variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research of the biodegradability of degradable/biodegradable plastic material in various types of environments| vauthors = Adamcova D, Radziemska M, Fronczyk J, Zloch J, Vaverkova MD | journal =  Przegląd Naukowy. Inżynieria I Kształtowanie Środowiska |year=2017|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a material may have tested as biodegrading at a high rate in the lab may not degrade at a high rate in a landfill because landfills often lack light, water, and microbial activity that are necessary for degradation to occur.&lt;ref name = "SLH"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1543-measuring-biodegradability|title=Measuring biodegradability|work=Science Learning Hub|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is very important that there are standards for plastic biodegradable products, which have a large impact on the environment. The development and use of accurate standard test methods can help ensure that all plastics that are being produced and commercialized will actually biodegrade in natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1995 |editor-last=Scott |editor-first=Gerald |editor2-last=Gilead |editor2-first=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Degradable Polymers | publisher = Dordrecht Springer | location = Netherlands | doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-0571-2 |isbn=978-94-010-4253-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One test that has been developed for this purpose is DINV 54900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witt U, Yamamoto M, Seeliger U, Müller RJ, Warzelhan V | title = Biodegradable Polymeric Materials-Not the Origin but the Chemical Structure Determines Biodegradability | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1438–1442 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 29711570 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1521-3773(19990517)38:10&lt;1438::aid-anie1438&gt;3.0.co;2-u }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Biodegradable plastic#Examples of biodegradable plastics}}

The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to a material that maintains its mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikada |first=Yoshito |last2=Tsuji |first2=Hideto | name-list-format = vanc |date= February 2000 | title = Biodegradable polyesters for medical and ecological applications |journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications |volume=21|issue=3|pages=117–132 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1521-3927(20000201)21:3&lt;117::aid-marc117&gt;3.0.co;2-x  | url = http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water soluble polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flieger M, Kantorová M, Prell A, Rezanka T, Votruba J | title = Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–44 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12744074 | doi = 10.1007/bf02931273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastics]] biodegrade at highly variable rates.  [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]]-based plumbing is selected for handling [[sewage]] because PVC resists biodegradation.  Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kyrikou |first=Ioanna |last2=Briassoulis |first2=Demetres | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 Apr 2007 |title=Biodegradation of Agricultural Plastic Films: A Critical Review  |journal=Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi= 10.1007/s10924-007-0053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[synthetic polymer]]s that biodegrade quickly include [[polycaprolactone]], other [[polyesters]] and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]], the renewably derived [[polylactic acid]], and the synthetic polycaprolactone. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).

:[[File:Polylactid sceletal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Polylactic acid]] is an example of a plastic that biodegrades quickly.]]
Under [[anaerobic decomposition|low oxygen]] conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed [[compost heap]]. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/33773706.PDF |title= Section 6: Biodegradability of Packaging Waste |publisher=Www3.imperial.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Chin-San | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physical properties and biodegradability of maleated-polycaprolactone/starch composite |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=127–134 |doi=10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00393-2 | url = http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, a bacterium named ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' was found to biodegrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

Many [[plastic producer]]s have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing [[corn starch]] as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the [[plastics industry]] operates under its own definition of compostable:
:"that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials." (Ref: [[ASTM]] D 6002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm | title = Compostable |publisher=Compostable.info |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "composting" is often used informally to describe the biodegradation of packaging materials. Legal definitions exist for compostability, the process that leads to compost.  Four criteria are offered by the European Union:&lt;ref name="EN 13432"&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of the EN 13432 standard |url= https://docs.european-bioplastics.org/publications/bp/EUBP_BP_En_13432.pdf | date = April 2015| work =  European Bioplastics  |access-date=July 22, 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Breulmann M, Künkel A, Philipp S, Reimer V, Siegenthaler KO, Skupin G, Yamamoto M | chapter = Polymers, Biodegradable | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.n21_n01 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Chemical composition''': volatile matter and heavy metals as well as fluorine should be limited.
#'''Biodegradability''': the conversion of &gt;90% of the original material into CO2, water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.
#'''Disintegrability''': at least 90% of the original mass should be decomposed into particles that are able to pass through a 2x2 mm sieve.
#'''Quality''': absence of toxic substances and other substances that impede composting.

== Biodegradable technology ==
Now biodegradable technology has become a highly developed market with applications in product [[packaging]], production, and medicine.  The biodegradation of biomass offers some guidances.&lt;ref name="pmid1736301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luzier WD | title = Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 839–42 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1736301 | pmc = 48337 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyesters are known to biodegrade.&lt;ref name="pmid12161646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross RA, Kalra B | title = Biodegradable polymers for the environment | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 803–7 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12161646 | doi = 10.1126/science.297.5582.803  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxo-biodegradation is defined by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] (the European Standards Organisation) as "degradation resulting from [[oxidative]] and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively." Whilst sometimes described as "oxo-fragmentable," and "oxo-degradable" these terms describe only the first or oxidative phase and should not be used for material which degrades by the process of oxo-biodegradation defined by CEN: the correct description is "oxo-biodegradable."

By combining plastic products with very large polymer molecules, which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], with [[oxygen]] in the air, the product is rendered capable of [[decomposing]] in anywhere from a week to one to two years. This reaction occurs even without prodegradant additives but at a very slow rate. That is why conventional plastics, when discarded, [[plastic waste|persist for a long time in the environment]]. Oxo-biodegradable formulations catalyze and accelerate the biodegradation process but it takes considerable skill and experience to balance the ingredients within the formulations so as to provide the product with a useful life for a set period, followed by degradation and biodegradation.&lt;ref name="pmid15864950"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agamuthu P, Faizura PN | title = Biodegradability of degradable plastic waste | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research : The Journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–100 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15864950 | doi = 10.1177/0734242X05051045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodegradable technology is especially utilized by the [[bio-medical]] community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:
medical, ecological, and dual application, while in terms of origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000" /&gt; The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]], which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection in the body and is based on [[lactic acid]], a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit.  Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in [[drug delivery]], as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Using Green Chemistry to Deliver Cutting Edge Drugs | author = The University of Nottingham | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070913132945.htm | work = Science Daily | date = September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biomedical applications include the use of biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers. Biodegradable implant materials can now be used for minimally invasive surgical procedures through degradable thermoplastic polymers. These polymers are now able to change their shape with increase of temperature, causing shape memory capabilities as well as easily degradable sutures. As a result, implants can now fit through small incisions, doctors can easily perform complex deformations, and sutures and other material aides can naturally biodegrade after a completed surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid11976407"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lendlein A, Langer R | title = Biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers for potential biomedical applications | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1673–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976407 | doi = 10.1126/science.1066102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation vs. composting ==
There is no universal definition for biodegradation and there are various definitions of composting, which has led to much confusion between the terms. They are often lumped together; however, they do not have the same meaning. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi or other biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez |first1=Eddie F. |last2=Michel |first2=Frederick C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biodegradability of conventional and bio-based plastics and natural fiber composites during composting, anaerobic digestion and long-term soil incubation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=December 2013 |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=2583–2591 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpiworld.org/Composting|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Composting|website=bpiworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant difference between the two is that one process is naturally-occurring and one is human-driven.

Biodegradable material is capable of decomposing without an oxygen source (anaerobically) into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, but the timeline is not very specifically defined. Similarly, compostable material breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass; however, compostable material also breaks down into inorganic compounds. The process for composting is more specifically defined, as it controlled by humans. Essentially, composting is an accelerated biodegradation process due to optimized circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magdoff|first=Fred | name-list-format = vanc |date= November 1993 |title=Building Soils for Better Crops |journal=Soil Science |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=371 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199311000-00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the end product of composting not only returns to its previous state, but also generates and adds beneficial microorganisms to the soil called humus. This organic matter can be used in gardens and on farms to help grow healthier plants in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/325510|title=Humus|last=Morris|first=Schnitzer|last2= Martin |first2 = James P. | name-list-format = vanc | work =AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.325510|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting more consistently occurs within a shorter time frame since it is a more defined process and is expedited by human intervention. Biodegradation can occur in different time frames under different circumstances, but is meant to occur naturally without human intervention.
[[File:Organic Waste Disposal Streams.pdf|thumb|This figure represents the different paths of disposal for organic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kranert M, Behnsen A, Schultheis A, Steinbach D | chapter =Composting in the Framework of the EU Landfill Directive |date=2002 | title = Microbiology of Composting |pages=473–486 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-08724-4_39 |isbn=9783642087059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Even within composting, there are different circumstances under which this can occur. The two main types of composting are at-home versus commercial. Both produce healthy soil to be reused - the main difference lies in what materials are able to go into the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At-home composting is mostly used for food scraps and excess garden materials, such as weeds. Commercial composting is capable of breaking down more complex plant-based products, such as corn-based plastics and larger pieces of material, like tree branches. Commercial composting begins with a manual breakdown of the materials using a grinder or other machine to initiate the process. Because at-home composting usually occurs on a smaller scale and does not involve large machinery, these materials would not fully decompose in at-home composting. Furthermore, one study has compared and contrasted home and industrial composting, concluding that there are advantages and disadvantages to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martínez-Blanco J, Colón J, Gabarrell X, Font X, Sánchez A, Artola A, Rieradevall J | title = The use of life cycle assessment for the comparison of biowaste composting at home and full scale | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 983–94 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20211555 | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2010.02.023 | url = http://ddd.uab.cat/record/163720 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following studies provide examples in which composting has been defined as a subset of biodegradation in a scientific context. The first study, "Assessment of Biodegradability of Plastics Under Simulated Composting Conditions in a Laboratory Test Setting," clearly examines composting as a set of circumstances that falls under the category of degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Starnecker A, Menner M  |date=1996-01-01|title=Assessment of biodegradability of plastics under simulated composting conditions in a laboratory test system |journal=International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|language=en|volume=37|issue=1–2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/0964-8305(95)00089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this next study looked at the biodegradation and composting effects of chemically and physically crosslinked polylactic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-01|title=Some composting and biodegradation effects of physically or chemically crosslinked poly(lactic acid) |journal=Polymer Testing |volume=31|issue=1|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.polymertesting.2011.09.012 |last1=Żenkiewicz |first1=Marian |last2=Malinowski |first2=Rafał |last3=Rytlewski |first3=Piotr |last4=Richert |first4=Agnieszka |last5=Sikorska |first5=Wanda |last6=Krasowska |first6=Katarzyna | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably discussing composting and biodegrading as two distinct terms. The third and final study reviews European standardization of biodegradable and compostable material in the packaging industry, again using the terms separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Avella M, Bonadies E, Martuscelli E, Rimedio R |date=2001-01-01|title=European current standardization for plastic packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation |journal=Polymer Testing|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=517–521|doi=10.1016/S0142-9418(00)00068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between these terms is crucial because waste management confusion leads to improper disposal of materials by people on a daily basis. Biodegradation technology has led to massive improvements in how we dispose of waste; there now exist trash, recycling, and compost bins in order to optimize the disposal process. However, if these waste streams are commonly and frequently confused, then the disposal process is not at all optimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akullian A, Karp C, Austin K, Durbin D | title =  Plastic Bag Externalities and Policy in Rhode Island | url = http://seattlebagtax.org/referencedpdfs/en-akullianetal.pdf | journal = Brown Policy Review | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable and compostable materials have been developed to ensure more of human waste is able to breakdown and return to its previous state, or in the case of composting even add nutrients to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JH, Murphy RJ, Narayan R, Davies GB | title = Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2127–39 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528060 | pmc = 2873018 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a compostable product is thrown out as opposed to composted and sent to a landfill, these inventions and efforts are wasted. Therefore, it is important for average citizens to understand the difference between these terms so that materials can be disposed of properly and efficiently.

== Environmental and social effects ==
Plastic pollution from illegal dumping poses health risks to wildlife. Animals often mistake plastics for food, resulting in intestinal entanglement. Slow-degrading chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nonylphenol (NP), and pesticides also found in plastics, can release into environments and subsequently also be ingested by wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Webb |first=Hayden |last2=Arnott |first2=Jaimys |last3=Crawford |first3=Russell |last4=Ivanova |first4=Elena |last5=Webb |first5=Hayden K. |last6=Arnott |first6=Jaimys |last7=Crawford |first7=Russell J. |last8=Ivanova|first8=Elena P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-12-28|title=Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate) |journal=Polymers |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3390/polym5010001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Carson, a notable environmentalist in the 1960s, provided one of the first key studies on the consequences associated with chemical ingestion in wildlife, specifically birds. In her work ''Silent Spring'', she wrote on [[DDT]], a pesticide commonly used in human agricultural activities.

In efforts to remediate the damages done by slow-degrading plastics, detergents, metals, and other pollutants created by humans, economic costs have become a concern.

In 2017, a [[Great Pacific garbage patch|garbage patch the size of Mexico]] was found in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be upwards of a million square miles in size. While the patch contains more obvious examples of litter (plastic bottles, cans, and bags), tiny microplastics are nearly impossible to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochman CM, Cook AM, Koelmans AA | title = Plastic debris and policy: Using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1617–26 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27331654 | doi = 10.1002/etc.3408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Geographic'' reports that even more non-biodegradable materials are finding their way into vulnerable environments - nearly thirty-eight million pieces a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shaena | last = Montanari | name-list-format = vanc |url= https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/ocean-plastic-patch-south-pacific-spd/ |title=Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific |date=2017-07-25 |access-date=2018-09-17 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that have not degraded can also serve as shelter for invasive species, such as tube worms and barnacles.

The World Trade Institute also notes that the communities who often feel most of the effects of poor biodegradation are poorer countries without the means to pay for their cleanup.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018" /&gt; In a positive feedback loop effect, they in turn have trouble controlling their own pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajat A, Hsia C, O'Neill MS | title = Socioeconomic Disparities and Air Pollution Exposure: a Global Review | journal = Current Environmental Health Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–50 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26381684 | pmc = 4626327 | doi = 10.1007/s40572-015-0069-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of "biodegradable" ==
The first known use of ''biodegradable'' in a biological context was in 1959 when it was  employed to describe the breakdown of material into innocuous components by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biodegradable|title=Definition of BIODEGRADABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now ''biodegradable'' is commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are part of the earth's innate cycles and capable of decomposing back into natural elements.

'''Boaz Cohen''' (1899–1968) was a leading American scholar of [[Talmud]], a legal decisor ([[posek]]), and a professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born and educated in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].  He was ordained as a [[rabbi]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS) in 1924.  Following his ordination, he was appointed Assistant Librarian of JTS.  In 1925, he was appointed an instructor of [[Talmud]], and went on to serve on the JTS faculty for four decades.  In 1927, he received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he published extensively on the Talmud and [[Jewish law]], while also authoring many comparative studies between Jewish law and other legal systems.  Many of those studies were published in a collection titled ''Jewish and Roman Law'' (New York, 1966).

Cohen also served as Chair of the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|Committee on Jewish Law]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], and he issued thousands of legal rulings.&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

The '''[http://ridl.cfd.rit.edu/ Center for Detectors (CfD)]''' is a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] College of Science academic research center. The CfD was founded in 2010 by [[Donald Figer|Dr. Donald Figer.]] Located in the [http://www.rit.edu/research/itc/ IT Collaboratory at RIT], the CfD designs, develops, and implements new advanced sensor technologies through collaboration with academic researchers, industry engineers, government scientists, and university students. The mission of the CfD is to enable scientific discovery, national security, better living, and commercial innovation through the design and development of advanced photon detectors and associated technology in a broad array of applications (e.g. [[astrophysics]], biomedical imaging, [[Earth system science]], and [[Interplanetary spaceflight|inter-planetary travel]]).

== Research ==
[[File:M13Final merged small CfD.jpg|left|thumb|Color image of M13, the Great Cluster in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], taken by CfD personnel using the Teledyne Hawaii 4RG SiPIN detector (HyViSI). This was the first demonstration of this device in an astronomical application.]]
The CfD uses a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning the many branches of engineering, imaging science, physics and astronomy. Some projects, such as the “Cosmic Ray Damaged Image Repair” project, incorporate astronomy and imaging science. Others, like the NASA-funded Phase II: New Infrared Detectors for Astrophysics project, unite microelectronic engineers, astronomy experts, imaging scientists, and various other professionals in science fields. The Center for Detectors benefits from employees that come from a diverse range of academic programs and professional occupations. The CfD staff includes professors, engineers, and students (undergraduate, masters, and PhD). Many student researchers apply CfD research to their current academic programs at RIT. Students pursue various degrees such as [[Microelectronics|Microelectronic]], [[Computer engineering|Computer]], and [[Electronic Engineering|Electrical Engineering]]. Many undergraduate student researchers choose to pursue master's degrees based on the research that they conduct at CfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:center-for-detectors&amp;catid=142:labs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=48266&lt;/ref&gt;

CfD is [[Grant (money)|grant-funded]] and has been awarded more than $16M in external funding since 2006. Primary sponsors include [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. Additional sources of funding include [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]],  [[Exelis Inc.|ITT Excelis]], and [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]].

==Outreach and Communications==
Education supplements to two of the CfD grants have funded projects involving students from local high schools. Students mapped the “Journey of a Photon,” and presented their work at venues nationwide. A second group of high school students used an RIT-developed 3D projection system dubbed the “Planeterrainium” to explore planetary surfaces in 3D.

The Center has been featured at several conferences and in press venues. CfD researcher Kim Kolb presented her MS thesis at the [http://spie.org/op SPIE Optics and Photonics Conferences]. The [http://www.rbj.net Rochester Business Journal] and [http://www.rit.edu/news/ RIT University News] have published articles summarizing the foundations of the Center for Detectors to the public, and informing the RIT community about the purpose of the facilities.

CfD has hosted a variety of distinguished speakers as well. Some presenters include Dr. Donald Hall of the [[University of Hawaii]], Dr. Chris Packham of the [[University of Florida]], Dr. Joss Bland-Hawthorn of the [[University of Sydney]], [[Bruce J. Tromberg|Bruce Tromberg]], of the University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Shouleh Nikzad, Dr. Michael Hoenk, and [[Bedabrata Pain]] of the [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technology’s]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

==Equipment and Facilities==
[[File:RIT CfD Dewar System.JPG|right|thumb|The Center's detector testing system uses custom-built cylindrical vacuum cryogenic dewars.]] The Center has four research labs: the [http://ridle.cis.rit.edu Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the [[Quantum Dot]] Detector Laboratory, the [[Cleanroom|Clean Room]] Probe Testing Laboratory, and the [[LIDAR]] Laboratory. Three test systems were designed at the CfD, which are essential to the lab’s detector-testing capabilities.

[[File:CfD Spot Projector.JPG|left|thumb|This laser spot projector is used in the Center for Detectors.

It was founded in 1968 by Professor [[H.W. van der Merwe]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], to conduct academic research on relations between "racial" groups, with the goal of promoting mutual acceptance and co-operation. 

Initially named the [[Abe Bailey]] Institute for Inter-Racial Studies after the original funding organisation, the Abe Bailey Trust, the Institute was renamed the Centre for Intergroup Studies in 1973.&lt;ref name="UCPress1973"/&gt;

During the 1980s this organization was attempting to address conflict resolution resulting from the South African policy of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Polity2011"/&gt;

Since 1990 the Centre is known as the Centre for Conflict Resolution.

The Centre is currently housed in the [[Coornhoop]], a 17th century farmhouse at 2 Dixton Road in [[Observatory, Cape Town]].

==Mandate/Mission==

[[File:CISDL &amp; Judge W - 2011 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=CISDL |''A few CISDL Members with CISDL patron H.E. Judge C.G Weeramantry, former Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, after a 2011 meeting.'']]

The Centre for International Sustainable Development Law (CISDL) exists to promote sustainable societies and the protection of ecosystems by advancing the understanding, development and implementation of international sustainable development law.

As part of its ongoing legal scholarship and research, the CISDL publishes books, articles, working papers and legal briefs in English, Spanish and French. The CISDL hosts academic workshops, dialogue sessions, legal expert panels parallel to international negotiations, law courses and seminar series, and conferences to further its legal research agenda. It provides instructors, lecturers and capacity- building materials for developing country governments and international organisations in national and international law in the field of sustainable development, and works with countries to develop national laws to implement international treaties in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;See http://cisdl.org/about-the-cisdl.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Sustainable Development Law==

Sustainable development law is found at the intersection of three principal fields of international law: international economic law, international environmental law and international social law. Sustainable development law refers to emerging substantive body of legal instruments, norms and treaties, supported by distinctive procedural elements.

In international treaty law, sustainable development is an agreed objective of many international treaties, both at the global and regional levels. As such, sustainable development can be considered part of the 'object and purpose' of a growing number of treaties, and therefore directly relevant in the interpretation of their provisions. The concept appears, often as an objective or preambular reference, in most international statements and declarations related to environmental, social and economic issues since the [[1992 Earth Summit|1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit]].

In the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|1992 Rio Declaration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163&amp;l=en |title=Rio Declaration – Rio Declaration on Environment and Development – United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=UNEP |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agenda 21]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/ |title=DSD :: Resources – Publications – Core Publications |publisher=United Nations  |date=June 14, 1992 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; governments committed to the "further development of international law on sustainable development, giving special attention to the delicate balance between environmental and developmental concerns." [[Sustainable development]] requires accommodation, reconciliation and integration between economic growth, [[social justice]] (including human rights) and [[environmental protection]] objectives, towards participatory improvement in collective quality of life for the benefit of both present and future generations. It has also featured as an object and purpose of many international economic, social and environmental treaties involving [[Developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]], as a concept which guides the decisions of international courts and tribunals, and the holdings of judges in national courts around the world.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on International Law on Sustainable Development, see for example {{cite web |url=http://cisdl.org/programmes_sdl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413043550/http://www.cisdl.org/programmes_sdl.html |archivedate=April 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The CISDL is federally incorporated as a [[not-for-profit organisation]] in Canada since 2001, and governed by a distinguished Board of Governors. It is guided by a roster of international advisors and expert collaborators. The management of the CISDL is entrusted to the CISDL Director as well as the CISDL Secretariat, which is based in Montreal, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://cisdl.org/people001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422041721/http://cisdl.org/people001.html |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Objectives==

The objectives of the CISDL are to:
– Advance International Sustainable Development Law (ISDL) scholarship through research and analysis.
– Build capacity, education and experience in ISDL. 
– Support the development and implementation of stronger ISDL. 
– Promote ISDL networks and knowledge dissemination, and 
– Strengthen the CISDL as an institution.

==Legal Research==

The CISDL is engaged in six primary areas of sustainable development law research and legal analysis, each of which is led by a CISDL Lead Counsel based at a law faculty, international organisation or firm.&lt;ref&gt;For more details about CISDL programmes, see {{cite web|url=http://cisdl.org/programmes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725173307/http://www.cisdl.org/programmes.html |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These CISDL programmes focus on intersections and sustainable development related laws on :

==Continuing Legal education==

The CISDL offers, in partnership with ILA Canadian Branch, an on-line course in international law offered for lawyers seeking to accomplish Continuing Legal Education credits. The course offers through 25 hours of related in-depth online training on international law which can be done from anywhere in the world. Through a series of modules with some of Canada and the World's best international law professors and experts, the International Law course focuses on topics such as the relevance on International law in Canada, trade and investment law, Climate Change, Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;For CISDL online Continuing Legal Education, see http://www.cisdl.org/continuing_education/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable Development Law Website==

In the Spring 2011, in partnership with ILA, IDLO and LCIL, the CISDL launched a new pilot website on sustainable development law. In recent years, discussions of the role of international law in sustainable development have expanded considerably, the concept of sustainable development is increasingly being invoked before nations and international courts and tribunals worldwide. With this new project, the CISDL sought to develop a tool for researchers around the world studying the legal dimension of sustainable development. This on-line analytical tool comprises a dynamic database of decisions from international courts and tribunals that have referred to, or used, the concept-objective of sustainable development, and related international legal principles. It also includes direct links to the decisions from economic, social and human rights and international public law courts and tribunals that have applied sustainable development principles in the resolution of disputes between 1992 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;To use the new tool, see http://www.cisdl.org/sustainable_development/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17747">The term '''culture industry''' ({{lang-de|Kulturindustrie}}) was coined by the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) and [[Max Horkheimer]] (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter "The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception", of the book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944), wherein they proposed that [[popular culture]] is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—[[film]]s, [[radio]] programmes, [[magazine]]s, etc.—that are used to manipulate [[mass society]] into passivity.&lt;ref name="ADOR" /&gt; Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the [[Mass media|mass communications media]], renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their [[economic]] circumstances.&lt;ref name="ADOR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horkheimer|first1=Max|last2=Adorno|first2=Theodor W.|last3=Ed. by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr. Transl. by Edmund Jephcott|title=Dialectic of enlightenment philosophical fragments|date=2002|publisher=Stanford Univ.

In contrast, true psychological needs are [[free will|freedom]], [[creativity]], and genuine [[happiness]], which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by [[Herbert Marcuse]]. (See ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', 1955).&lt;ref name="MARC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcuse|first1=Herbert|title=Eros and civilization : a philosophical inquiry into Freud|date=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-0807015544|edition=4. pr.|url=http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-II-Beyond-the-Reality-Principle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Frankfurt School==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Members of The Frankfurt School were much influenced by the [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]], as well as the revisitation of the dialectical [[idealism]] of [[Hegel]]; both events are studied not in isolation, but as part of the process of change. As a group later joined by [[Jürgen Habermas]], they were responsible for the formulation of [[critical theory]]. In works such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'', Adorno and Horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of [[mass culture]] has a political implication, namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single ''culture industry'' whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the ''masses'' to market interests.

==The theory==
The essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the supply-driven nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system.&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66&gt;Durham (2003) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.68&lt;/ref&gt; The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno make consistent comparisons between [[Fascist Germany]] and the American film industry. They highlight the presence of mass-produced culture, created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive, homogenised audience in both systems.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.71&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates the logic of domination in post-enlightenment modern society, by monopoly capitalism or the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that 'integrates its consumers from above', arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order, the holistic power of the individual is undermined.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Adorno and Horkheimer's work was influenced by both the broader socio-political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists. Written in California in the early 1940s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically Jewish, German émigrés, The Culture Industry is influenced by European politics and the war by which the continent was consumed.&lt;ref name="Scannell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scannell|first1=Paddy|title=Media and communication|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publ.|location=Los Angeles [u.a.]|isbn=9781412902687|page=37|edition=Repr.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-LfZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=jewish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the American film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation,&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66 /&gt; it was "Hollywood at its most classical, American mass culture at its most Fordist".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (1992) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social, political and economic theory,&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) pp.37–44&lt;/ref&gt; most notably:

* [[Karl Marx]]'s theories of alienation and commodity fetishism,
* [[Max Weber]]'s instrumental reason, and 
* [[Georg Lukacs]]' concept of the reification of consciousness.

Anything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions. There will also be a use value: the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility. The exchange value will reflect its utility and the conditions of the market: the prices paid by the television broadcaster or at the box office. Yet, the modern [[soap opera]]s with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass-produced cultural product. Only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value, e.g. ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), starring [[George C. Scott]] as the eponymous American general, was released at a time of considerable anti-war sentiment. The opening shot is of Patton in front of an American flag making an impassioned speech. This was a form of [[dialectic]] in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely (the thesis) or ironically (the antithesis) and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film. However, the film is manipulating specific historical events, not only as entertainment, but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities. Given that the subtext was instrumental and not "value free", ethical and philosophical considerations arise.

Normally, only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries, but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight. A film like ''Patton'' is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which, according to Adorno, is regressing into a cultural blandness. To Hegel, order is good ''a priori'', i.e. it does not have to answer to those living under it. But, if order is disturbed? In ''Negative Dialectics'', Adorno believed this tended towards progress by stimulating the possibility of class conflict. Marx's theory of Historical Materialism was [[Teleology|teleological]], i.e. society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism. But Adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the ''[[status quo]]'' and stimulate the final communist state to emerge.

==Mass culture==
A central point of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' is the topic of "the Enlightenment as the deception of the masses". The term "culture industry" is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture, the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to "authentic culture".

Horkheimer and Adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them. The culture industry delivers the "goods" so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them. Through mass production, everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities. Everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what's best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible. Psychological drives become stoked to the point where [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] is no longer possible.

Movies serve as an example. "All films have become similar in their basic form. They are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible. Even fantasy films, which claim to not reflect such reality, don't really live up to what they claim to be. No matter how unusual they strive to be, the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas. Also, for example, erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible."&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Enlightenment&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The aims of the culture industry are—as in every industry—economic in nature. All endeavors become focused on economic success.

Authentic culture, however, is not goal-oriented, but is an end in itself. Authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities, but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought. Authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such. Authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre-formed schemas.

As for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry, Horkheimer and Adorno contend that it arises from companies' pursuit of the maximization of profit, in the economic sense. However, this cannot be said to be culture, or what culture is supposed to be. It can only be described as being a form of commerce, just like any other kind of commerce.

The culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn "mass media" and their consumers. 
However, for Adorno, the term "culture industry" does not refer to "mass culture", or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses. On the contrary, such involvement of the masses is only apparent, or a type of seeming democratic participation. Adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of "defrauding of the masses". Horkheimer and Adorno deliberately chose the term "culture industry" instead of "mass culture" or "mass media".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; "The culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145"&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity: "Amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145" /&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno, above all, in their critical analyses, delve into what they call "the fraying of art" and the "de-artification of art", and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry. Works of art have become commodified: Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement. According to Critical Theory, "selling out" is not the decisive factor involved, but rather it's the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Culture today is infecting everything with sameness."&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, subversion has become no longer possible.

==Observations==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Wiggershaus Rolf say that the products of [[mass culture]] would not be popular if people did not enjoy them, and that culture is self-determining in its administration. This would deny Adorno contemporary political significance, arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought. He also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore Adorno's work which, in part, stems from Adorno's inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories. For instance, Wiggershaus states: "The other side of Adorno's apparently paradoxical definition was ignored: that only rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art was only possible, in any significant sense, as a product of subjectivity"&lt;ref name="Wiggershaus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolf|first1=Wiggershaus|last2=translated by: Michael|first2=Robertson|title=The Frankfurt School : its history, theories, and political significance|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262731133|pages=513|edition=1st MIT Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vZMjjW4uOWIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+Frankfurt+School+:+its+history,+theories,+and+political+significance&amp;ots=YIoZkLlBfC&amp;sig=hFjxWnRNLmkF2eMqJR48BpcpUiY#v=onepage&amp;q=Adorno%20thought%20art%20had%20lost%20its%20way%20and%20changed%20into%20ideology.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing Marxism. Whereas he accepted the classical Marxist analysis of society showing how one class exercises domination over another, he deviated from Marx in his failure to use dialectic as a method to propose ways to change. Marx's theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class, but Adorno and Horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement. 
Adorno's idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over. 
Other critics note that "High culture" too is not exempt from a role in the justification of capitalism. The establishment and reinforcement of [[elitism]] is seen by these critics as a key element in the role of such genres as [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

'''Dance education''' is the transferring of [[dance]] performance skills and knowledge of dance to [[students]] through teaching and [[training]], or acquiring such knowledge and skills through [[research]].

==Curriculum==
In general, a dance education [[curriculum]] is designed to impart dance performance skills, or knowledge of dance, or both to students. Knowledge-oriented curricula may cover any of a diverse range of topics, including [[dance notation]], [[human anatomy]], [[physics]], [[dance history]], and cultural aspects of dance.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

A curriculum may involve the study of one or more dance genres, including formal genres such as [[ballet]], [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]], [[contemporary dance|contemporary]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[Latin dancing|Latin]], and [[tap dance|tap]] dance, and informal and social genres such as [[line dancing|line]], [[freestyle dance|freestyle]], and [[sequence dancing|sequence]] dancing.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Professional dance education==
Professional and [[vocational education|vocational]] dance education is offered by both public and private institutions. Private institutions, which are commonly known as dance schools or dance colleges, are typically focused on dance education, whereas public institutions usually cover a broad range of topics. Examples of private institutions include the [[Royal Ballet School]] and the [[School of American Ballet]].

Many public and private universities and colleges offer minor programs in dance, or major programs with academic degrees such as [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], and [[Master of Fine Arts]] in dance. Some public [[secondary education]] institutions offer comprehensive dance education curricula. For example, [[Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon)]] offers concentrated vocational dance education in conjunction with its pre-professional dance company, [[The Jefferson Dancers]].

An '''ecodistrict''' or eco-district is a neologism associating the terms "district" and "eco" as an abbreviation of ecological.
It designates an [[Urbanism|urban]] planning aiming to integrate objectives of "[[sustainable development]]" and reduce the [[ecological footprint]] of the project. This notion insists on the consideration of the whole environmental issues by attributing them ambitious levels of requirements.

Ecodistricts can be found in metropolises such as :

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Elocutio''' is the term for the mastery of stylistic elements in Western classical [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''loqui'', "to speak". Although the word ''elocution'' is now associated more with eloquent speaking, it connoted "style" for the classical rhetorican.

It is the third of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing. Beginning in the [[Renaissance]], writers increasingly emphasized the stylistic aspects of rhetoric over the other divisions of rhetoric.

An orator or writer had a number of things to decide in developing a style for a particular discourse. First, there was the level of style; plain (''attenuata'' or ''subtile''), middle (''mediocris'' or ''robusta''), or high (''florida'' or ''gravis''). Writers were instructed to match the basic style to their subject matter and audience. For instance, [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' deemed the plain style suitable for instruction, the middle for moving oration, and the high for charming discourse. Today, elocution and rhetoric are associated with the last of the styles, but for rhetoricians, each style was useful in rhetoric.

The ancient authors agreed that the four ingredients necessary to achieve good style included correctness, clearness, appropriateness, and ornament.

Sometimes translated as "purity," correctness meant that rhetors should use words that were current and adhered to the grammatical rules of whatever language they wrote. Correctness rules are standards of grammar and usage drawn from traditional grammar.

In regard to clarity, most ancient teachers felt that clarity meant that rhetors should use words in their ordinary or everyday senses. The object of clarity was to allow meaning to "shine through" like light through a window.

Appropriateness probably derives from the Greek rhetorical notion to ''prepon'', meaning to say or do whatever is fitting in a given situation. Ancient teachers taught that close attention to kairos will help to determine the appropriate style.

The last and most important of the excellences of style is ornament, which is defined as extraordinary or unusual use of language. Ornamentation was divided into three broad categories: figures of speech, figures of thought, and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. Figures of speech are any artful patterning or arrangement of language. Figures of thought are artful presentations of ideas, feelings, concepts and figures of thought that depart from the ordinary patterns of argument. Tropes are any artful substitution of one term for another.

A great amount of attention was paid to [[figure of speech|figures of speech]], which were classified into various types and subtypes. One Renaissance writer, [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], enumerated 184 different figures of speech, but it could be argued that it was a manifestation of the increasing overemphasis on style that began in the Renaissance.

Also important to ''elocutio'' were subjects that would now be generally regarded as grammatical: the proper use of punctuation and conjunctions; the desirable order of words in a sentence (unlike English, many languages are not as dependent on word order to establish relationships between words and so choices of word order may revolve more around form than function); and the length of sentences.

"'''Focus Phrase'''" is a term traditionally used in cognitive-therapy and awareness-management discussions, and now in more general use to describe elicitor statements that evoke a desired refocusing of attention. Psychologically related terms are ''elicitor phrase'' or ''statement of intent''.

The psychological term "Focus Phrase" is now used by therapists and life coaches as a general term.

==Definition==

"Focus phrase" is defined as "a specially-constructed short sentence or phrase that states a person's inner intent to refocus his or her attention immediately in a new pre-ordained direction".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Based both on new research in [[cognitive science]] and on [[cognitive-shifting]] studies of ancient [[meditation]] techniques (see [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]), focus phrases have been used as a meditative tool and therapy aid, and are being introduced as at-work attentive boosts. They are carefully designed by professionals to almost instantly redirect the mind's attention specifically toward worthwhile sensations, thoughts, images, and other mental experiences. Focus phrases are highly effective in evoking rapid shifts in mental content, quality of awareness, sensory perception, and general inner experience. Therefore, they are considered of high value in meditative methods, and even in creativity-boost techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Traditional cognitive therapy usage==

As explained by the founder of cognitive therapy, [[Aaron Beck]], our chronic thoughtflows (stream of consciousness) tend to dominate our inner experience and stimulate our behavior and emotions. If we want to change our inner experience (for instance from a negative mood to a more positive mood) we need to take charge of the thoughts we are holding in our minds, and state our intent to shift into a preferable mood or quality of consciousness. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The theory of [[cognitive therapy]] teaches that the power of the spoken word in stating one's intent is primary for manifestation of one's intent. In ancient times, the [[Creation myth]] found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]] relates that "God said let there be light, and there was light." Perhaps "Let there be light" was the primary focus phrase for our universe. And throughout [[anthropology]] studies, a verbal statement of intent (a blessing; a curse) was considered a decisive act in manifesting that intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Business applications==

In corporate awareness-training, focus phrases are used not to change the outer world, but to rapidly shift inner attention, and thus alter personal experience and behavior. For instance, in order to shift rapidly from being lost in thought to present-moment alertness, the following core focus phrase drawn both from [[perceptual]] psychology and ancient [[Yoga]] meditative tradition is used: "I feel the air flowing in and out of my nose." Immediately, as often explained by spiritual teacher [[Alan Watts]] in his numerous books, the words have the psychological power to turn your attention toward the actual breathing experience - which in turn awakens your awareness to sensory experience in the present moment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Elicitor statements using this general 'focus phrase technology' for mental refocusing can be used to redirect attention toward a more positive mood ("I let go of my worries, and feel peaceful inside"), toward more creative states of mind ("I am open to receive insight into my dilemma"), toward interpersonal relating ("I accept this person just as they are"), or toward any other intent to improve one's experience and behavior.

The term Focus Phrase is recently becoming a more general-usage term found in daily communication, referring to any short sentence intended to help a person's performance or inner experience.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There is also some negative discussion of the term. In the opposite direction, the term Focus Phrase has been studied academically as a part of a Semantics dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925030141/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drama]], a '''frame''' is a situation or position of importance given to a person, and '''distance''' relates to how engaged the frame makes the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematography|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
*A [[news reporter|reporter]] would be furthest away from the action as they would be a [[wikt:spectator|spectator]], reporting on events.
*A [[soldier]] or [[policeman]] would be in the action, and is actually within the [[drama]], being closest.

[[Dorothy Heathcote]] created the idea of frames and distance. These concepts can be applied to thinking about a [[target group]] and how willing they would be to interact with the drama. A younger child is more likely to want to become part of the action, while a [[teenager]] is more likely to want to observe and comment on the action.

The '''French National School for the Judiciary''' ([[French language|French]]: ''École nationale de la magistrature'' or ENM) is a French post-graduate school, where French judges and [[public prosecutor]]s are trained. The institution was created by ordinance of 22 December 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{Légifrance|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000339259|texte=Ordinance No. 58-1270 of 22 December 1958 for an organic law regarding the status of the judiciary}}, article 14 in its original version: « Il est institué un centre national d’études judiciaires »&lt;/ref&gt; as the "National Centre for Judicial Studies" (French: ''Centre national d'études judiciaires''). It became the French National School for the Judiciary in 1972. It is located in [[Bordeaux]] and has premises in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;French National School for the Judiciary web site, [http://www.enm.justice.fr/anglais/home.php Presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512155549/http://www.enm.justice.fr/anglais/home.php |date=2009-05-12 }}. Consulted on May 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial training ==
The aim of the training provided by the ENM is to form a corps of judges and public prosecutors who are suitable for all posts on the bench as well as in the public prosecution service in first instance courts. 
The judicial functions are :
*''Tribunal de Grande Instance'' judge
*''Instance'' (small claims) Court judge
*Investigating judge
*Juvenile Court judge
*Probation judge
*Deputy Public Prosecutor

A prospective judge or deputy public prosecutor must complete a Bachelor in Law (which requires three years of study) and a Master in Law (which requires two years of study) before entering the National School for the Judiciary.  Admission is made through an entrance examination, which people generally take after completing dedicated studies in post-graduate preparatory class (''Institut d'études judiciaires'').{{cn|date=October 2012}}

In 2013, 2280 people were candidates; among them, 324 were invited to oral examinations, and 214 were admitted.{{cn|date=March 2014}} [[French citizenship]] is required for admission to the French National School for the Judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr-icon}} "''Pour s’y présenter, il faut être .. de nationalité française''", in French National School for the Judiciary web site, [http://www.enm.justice.fr/_uses/lib/5778/fiche_recrut_1er_concours_300409.pdf Magistrat, Les recrutements sur concours], page 1.

The '''Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute''' (HWI) is an independent, not-for-profit, [[biomedical]] research facility located in the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]].  Its focus is on structural biology with a strong history in methods development and the application of X-ray crystallography in fundamental studies.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Medical research==
HWI scientists work to find the fundamental causes of many diseases. For example, cancer is being attacked by identifying new classes of [[anti-tumor]] agents including new [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s for [[hormone]]-dependent [[breast tumor]]s. Other projects include:
*Finding new ways to fight opportunistic infections in [[AIDS]] patients
*Combating inflammation in arthritis and [[cardiovascular disease]]
*Preventing [[bronchial infection]]s in [[cystic fibrosis]] patients
HWI scientists use a methodology known as [[structural biology]], which allows them to create 3D models of the [[molecule]]s that build up cells. The investigation results provide many insights into how these molecular machines work, including the starting points for the design of better drugs.  HWI is also focused to developing highly trained researchers and in its role as the Department of Structural and Computational Biology for the [[University at Buffalo]], the Institute typically trains about a dozen [[PhD]] students and sponsors internship programs for high school and college students.&lt;ref name="HWIabout"&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT HWI|url=http://www.hwi.buffalo.edu/about_hwi/about_hwi.html|website=hwi.buffalo.edu|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute was founded in 1956 as the "Medical Foundation of Buffalo" and came into existence through the combined efforts of Dr. George F. Koepf, who provided the vision, and Helen Woodward Rivas, who provided generous financial support. Koepf was a [[physician]] and [[endocrinologist]] whose interest in research began during his second year at [[medical school]] and continued at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. After leaving Johns Hopkins, he returned to practice medicine in Buffalo and became a founding member of the Buffalo Medical Group. One of his patients, Helen Woodward Rivas, expressed great interest in funding a medical research effort in Buffalo. Through her $3 million ({{Inflation|US|3000000|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) gift, the Medical Foundation (MFB) came into being.

[[File:Herbert Hauptman - UB 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Herbert Hauptman at University of Buffalo graduation in 2009]]An example of the basic research carried out includes studying disease processes at the molecular scale. For example it was reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2009/01/05/daily41.html Hauptman closer to breast cancer cure]&lt;/ref&gt; that a researcher at the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute had moved a step closer to a cure, and possibly the prevention, of the most common type of breast cancer.

In 1994, the Medical Foundation was renamed the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute. The name "Hauptman" comes from [[Herbert A. Hauptman]], who pioneered mathematical techniques for determining atomic structure from X-ray diffraction. For this discovery, Hauptman and [[Jerome Karle]] were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1985.

In 1999, the Institute received a three-year $1.5 ({{Inflation|US|1500000|1999|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) million challenge grant from the [[John R. Oishei|John R. Oishei Foundation]] along with a $750,000 ({{Inflation|US|750000|1999|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) award from the [[Margaret L. Wendt Foundation]] that established a Structural Biology Center at HWI. All aspects of structural research from isolating the gene that codes for a protein of interest to applying the latest [[crystallographic]] methods are now possible here. Through this Center, HWI scientists were able to create new and improved crystal growth methods including the development of a novel and patented high-throughput robotic crystallization technique for expediting and optimizing the crystallization process.&lt;ref name="HWIhist"&gt;{{cite web|title=HWI History|url=http://www.hwi.buffalo.edu/about_hwi/history.html|website=hwi.buffalo.edu|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, BWI became a founding partner of the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]] "BNMC," and created the [[University at Buffalo]] Department of Structural Biology. Dr. George DeTitta was appointed Executive Director and CEO and Dr. Walter Pangborn was appointed to Executive Vice President. Shortly thereafter, four new scientists were added.  As the [[University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]], both members of BNMC, began plans to construct new facilities, HWI joined to form the Buffalo Life Sciences Complex which is located in the heart of the BNMC adjacent to the [[University at Buffalo|UB]] and [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute|RPCI]] sites. [[CannonDesign]] was retained along with architect Mehrdad Yazdani to design a research and office complex and construction of the [[Gates Vascular Institute|Structural Biology Research Center]] began in August 2003, through the support of [[New York State]], the Federal Government, local foundations, community leaders, and individuals, as well as financing through [[KeyBank]]. BWI moved into the new facility in April 2005, and have since recruited four additional scientists to the facility.&lt;ref name="HWIhist"/&gt;

===Leadership===
On April 1, 2008, George DeTitta stepped down as CEO to return to full-time work in the lab and on July 1, 2008, Eaton E. (Ed) Lattman, formerly a Professor of [[Biophysics]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] became HWI's new CEO. Ed was previously the Dean of Research and Graduate Education at Hopkins.&lt;ref name="HWIhist"/&gt;

On December 1, 2014, Dr. Edward H. Snell was appointed CEO following eight years of service to HWI as a Senior Research Scientist.  Before joining HWI, Dr. Snell was a staff scientist in [[NASA]]’s Structural Biology Laboratory at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="HWIhist"/&gt;

===Awards===
The institute has sponsored the award "Pioneer of Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=News &amp; Notes: Wilcove GS ’85 wins Pioneer of Science Award |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2011/09/news-notes-wilcove-gs-85-wins-pioneer-of-science-award |work=[[The Daily Princetonian]] |date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs a popular annual wine tasting event where Riedel glassware is coupled with quality wines and champagne and the influence of the shape of the glass on the taste demonstrated. The link between the glass, wine and research, comes from the use of crystals in the research and the rich information they supply when examined in detail.

The '''history of glass-making''' dates back to at least 3600 years ago in [[Mesopotamia]]. However, they may have been producing second-rate copies of glass objects from [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where this complex craft originated.&lt;ref name="Egyptglass"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassmaking-may-have-begun-egypt-not-mesopotamia |title=Glassmaking may have begun in Egypt, not Mesopotamia Artifacts from Iraq site show less sophisticated technique, color palette |accessdate=2016-11-25 |date=2016-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt.&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |title=Glass Online: The History of Glass |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415194738/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known glass objects, of the mid second millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA|True glazing over a ceramic body was not used until many centuries after the production of the first glass.}} Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|late Bronze Age]] civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt.

Development of glass technology in [[India]] may have begun in 1730 BC.&lt;ref name=Gowlett&gt;{{cite book|last =  Gowlett| first = J.A.J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sM62_gbWP-8C&amp;pg=PA277|title = High Definition Archaeology: Threads Through the Past| publisher = Routledge| year = 1997| isbn = 0-415-18429-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Chinese glass|ancient China]], though, glass-making seems to have had a late start compared to ceramics and metal work. From across the former [[Roman Empire]] archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and [[funerary]] contexts.
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.

==Origins==
[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia 2 retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Berlin glass amphora from Olbia|glass amphora]] from the [[Hellenistic period]].]]
Naturally occurring [[glass]], especially the [[volcanism|volcanic]] glass [[obsidian]], has been used by many [[Stone Age]] societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]] or [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"/&gt; Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Vitrification|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Compacted oxide layer glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA}}

During the [[Late Bronze Age]] in [[Egypt]] (e.g., the [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep "Treasure"]]) and [[Western Asia]] (e.g., [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]),&lt;ref&gt;These early examples are drawn from {{cite journal|author=Christine Lilyquist|title=Granulation and Glass: Chronological and Stylistic Investigations at Selected Sites, ca. 2500-1400 B.C.E.|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=290/291 |year=1993|issue=290|pages=29–94|jstor=1357319}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a rapid growth in [[glassmaking]] technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass [[ingots]], vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized [[hardstone carvings]] in [[Gemstone|semi-precious stones]]) and the ubiquitous beads. The [[alkali]] of Syrian and Egyptian glass was [[soda ash]] ([[sodium carbonate]]), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably [[halophile]] seashore plants like [[saltwort]]. The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings.

Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of [[oxide]]s were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth ([[marver]]ed) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for [[inlay]]s were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, H. "Technologische Innovationen im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr.

By the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in [[Western Asia]], [[Crete]], and [[Egypt]]; and the [[Mycenaean Greek]] term {{lang|gmy|𐀓𐀷𐀜𐀺𐀒𐀂}}, ''ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i'', meaning "workers of [[lapis lazuli]] and glass" (written in [[Linear b]] [[syllabic script]]) is attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16799|title=The Linear B word ku-wa-no-wo-ko|website=Palaeolexicon.

It is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded [[trade secret|technological secret]] reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the [[Ulu Burun]] [[shipwreck]] off the coast of modern [[Turkey]].

Glass remained a luxury material, and the [[Bronze Age collapse|disasters]] that overtook [[Late Bronze Age]] civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking "manual" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in [[cuneiform]] tablets discovered in the library of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]. In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Alexandria]]. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the [[Hellenistic]] period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' [[viscous]] (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and '[[millefiori]]' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas, R. W.|title=A history of glassmaking|publisher=G T Foulis &amp; Co Ltd|place=Henley-on-Thames|year=1972|isbn=0-85429-117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Phoenicia]]n traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the [[Belus River]]. [[Georgius Agricola]], in ''[[De re metallica]]'', reported a traditional serendipitous "discovery" tale of familiar type:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with [[nitre|nitrum]] being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass."&lt;ref name=Agricola&gt;[[Georg Agricola|Agricola, Georgius]], ''[[De re metallica]]'', translated by Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, Dover Publishing.

This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC [[glass blowing]] was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry.  Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world.{{Citation needed|reason=no source for glass use in Roman world|date=December 2010}} Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria{{Citation needed|reason=no source for Jewish glassblowers|date=December 2010}} spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of [[manganese dioxide]]), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.

==History by culture==
===Iran===
The first Persian glass was discovered in the explorations of Dinkhahtepe in Azarbaijan by Burny.  It was glass bead from the late Bronze Age (1600 B.C.).  Then in the middle Elam era of Chogha, Zanbil Temple existed. Many glass tubes were discovered by French teams.  Today it is certain that the mosaic glass cups from the Iron Age of North Iran, such as Hassnlou Tepe, Marlik Tepe. It resembles a number of Mesopotamian examples, in Susa of late Elam, a few glass vessels were discovered, of core forming technique.  Also in Azarbaijan and Kordestan, the Gilan provinces, a few kohl tubes were discovered from the late Iron Age that continued into the Achamenid period. In this time achamind bowls and colorless glass growing on empair but in selukid and parthian times helleni and roman techniques were Prevalented and Sassanian era seem local motives on glass vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{salehvand,2016}}=title= the history of glass and glass making, glassware of Arsacid era in the collections of Iran National museum and reza Abbasi museum|publisher = Samira| year = 2016| isbn = 9789648955491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nanyue flat blue glass.JPG|thumb|Blue glass plaques found in the [[Mausoleum of the Nanyue King]], dating from late 2nd century BC]]
In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin, C. (2002) "Introduction" pp. XI-XIV in Braghin, C.

Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Soame Jenyns (art historian)|Jenyns, R.]] (1981) ''Chinese Art III: Textiles, Glass and Painting on Glass''. Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC to 221 BC).

Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.&lt;ref name=pinder&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. (1991) "The Islamic lands and China"  p. 140 in Tait, H. (ed) ''Five thousand years of glass''.

During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.&lt;ref name=pinder/&gt; The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and [[Han Dynasty]] vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects.

===Islamic world===
{{main|Islamic glass}}
Islamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the [[Sasanian glass]] of [[Persia]]. The [[Arabic poetry|Arab poet]] al-[[Buhturi]] (820–897) described the clarity of such glass: "Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container."&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan|Hassan, Ahmad Y]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715024128/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm |date=2010-07-15 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]]-[[Arab]] chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' (''The Book of the Hidden Pearl''), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Ahmad Y.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:AndelysVitrail.jpg|thumb|left|A 16th-century stained glass window]]
The Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and [[Anglo-Saxon glass]] and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude [[forest glass]].  The [[claw beaker]] was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass.  Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

Glass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of [[Torcello]] near [[Venice]]. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: [[potash]] obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth605/File5.htm| title = Glass Conservation|accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Donny L. Hamilton|publisher = Conservation Research Laboratory, Texas A&amp;M University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 12th century, [[stained glass]] – glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring – was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for [[Romanesque art]] and especially [[Gothic art]].  Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings.  The 11th century saw the emergence in [[Germany]] of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century [[Venice]]. The [[Crown glass process]] was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the [[glassblower]] would spin approximately 9 [[Avoirdupois|pounds]] (4&amp;nbsp;kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as [[forest glass]].

====Anglo-Saxon world====
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon glass}}
Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"&gt;Bayley, J.

London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.&lt;ref name="Evison2000"&gt;Evison, V. I. (2000). "Glass vessels in England, 400–1100 CE" pp. 47–104 in Price, J. ''Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350–1100''. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation of [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and the construction of churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"&gt;Heyworth, M.

====Murano====
{{main|Murano glass|Venetian glass}}
The center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of [[Murano]], which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in [[dinnerware]], [[mirror]]s, and other items. What made Venetian [[Murano glass]] significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with [[soda ash]] obtained from the [[Levant]], for which the Venetians held the sole [[monopoly]]. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called ''obsidianus'' after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.&lt;ref name=Agricola1&gt;[[Georg Agricola]] ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'', Textbook of Mineralogy, M.C.

The Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. [[Murano]]’s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

====Bohemia====
{{main|Bohemian glass}}
[[Bohemian glass]], or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative [[glass]] produced in regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now in the current state of the [[Czech Republic]], since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nbig6p_r24C&amp;q=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9vtbD2NfUAhVY-mMKHUweDioQ6AEIJDAA|title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|last=inc|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=9780852295533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Both Nový Bor and Kamenický Šenov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels.

==Modern glass production==

===New processes===
[[Image:Ravenscroft Glass VAndA.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of [[George Ravenscroft|Ravenscroft's]] glass.]]
A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using [[Coal#Ranks|sea-coal]] as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the "working period" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by [[George Ravenscroft]] in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian ''cristallo'', he used [[flint glass|flint as a silica source]], but his glasses tended to [[wikt:crizzle|crizzle]], developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Roy G.|author2=Sandra Davison|title=Conservation of Glass|year=1989|series=Butterworth – Heinemann Series in Conservation and Museology|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]]|location=London|isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of [[Henley-on-Thames]].&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3105182 |jstor=3105182 |pages=776–803 |last1=MacLeod |first1=Christine |title=Accident or Design? George Ravenscroft's Patent and the Invention of Lead-Crystal Glass |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Technology and Culture |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over [[Europe]] with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a [[Glass tax|lucrative tax]] on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as ''Excise glasses''.&lt;ref name=hurst-vose&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst-Vose|first=Ruth|title=Glass|year=1980|series=Collins Archaeology|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|location=London|isbn=0-00-211379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845.

Evidence of the use of the [[blown plate glass]] method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting [[Polished plate glass]] in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown "sheet" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th edition (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at [[Ravenhead]]. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.

===Industrial production===
[[File:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The façade of [[the Crystal Palace]], one of the first buildings to use glass as a main material for construction.]]
The use of glass as a building material was heralded by [[The Crystal Palace]] of 1851, built by [[Joseph Paxton]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]]. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the [[British Crown Glass Company]] (later [[Chance Brothers]]) became the first company to adopt the [[cylinder blown sheet|cylinder method]] to produce sheet glass with the expertise of [[Georges Bontemps]], a famous French glassmaker.{{refn|group=n|This process was used extensively until early in the 20th Century to make window glass.}} This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]], down which it was carried by a system of rollers.&lt;ref&gt;''Bontemps on Glassmaking: the Guide du Verrier of Georges Bontemps'', translated by Michael Cable (2008). Society of Glass Technology. {{ISBN|0900682604}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.

An early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer [[Henry Bessemer]]. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of "Float Glass" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin.

In 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in [[Castleford]], [[Yorkshire]]. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M5TAAAAMAAJ|title=Glass: its tradition and its makers|author=Buch Polak, Ada |year=1975|publisher=Putnam|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Chance_Brothers_and_Co|title=Chance Brothers and Co|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StHelensPilkingtonsTheHotties.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Pilkington]]'s factory, where the [[float glass]] process was developed in the 1950s.]]
In 1898, [[Pilkington]] invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer "Georgian Wired Glass" but it greatly post-dates the [[Georgian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3dqs6zRCcEC|title=Practical Building Conservation: Glass and glazing|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=468|isbn=9780754645573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Machine drawn cylinder sheet glass|Machine Drawn Cylinder technique]] was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by [[Pilkington]] from 1910 onwards.

In 1938, the [[Polished plate glass|polished plate process]] was improved by [[Pilkington]] which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary [[float glass]] process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1969.0212|title=Review Lecture. The Float Glass Process|first=L. A. B.|last=Pilkington|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html "Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT®"]. SCHOTT AG.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight.&lt;ref name=floatpatent&gt;Bickerstaff, Kenneth and Pilkington, Lionel A B {{US Patent |2911759}} "Manufacture of flat glass". Priority date December 10, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.

[[Image:Pyrithione-tautomerism-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|[[Skeletal formula]]e of 1-hydroxy-2(''1H'')-pyridinethione and its [[tautomer]]]]
The '''hydroxyl radical''', '''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH''', is the neutral form of the [[hydroxide]] ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive (easily becoming [[hydroxyl]] groups) and consequently short-lived; however, they form an important part of [[radical (chemistry)|radical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayyan M., Hashim M.A., AlNashef I.M. | year = 2016 | title = Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications | url = | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 3029–3085 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably hydroxyl radicals are produced from the decomposition of [[organic peroxide|hydroperoxides]] (ROOH) or, in [[atmospheric chemistry]], by the reaction of [[excited state|excited]] [[atomic oxygen]] with water. It is also an important radical formed in radiation chemistry, since it leads to the formation of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]], which can enhance [[corrosion]] and [[stress corrosion cracking|SCC]] in coolant systems subjected to radioactive environments. Hydroxyl radicals are also produced during UV-light dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (suggested in 1879) and likely in [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]], where trace amounts of reduced transition metals catalyze peroxide-mediated oxidations of organic compounds.

In [[organic synthesis]], hydroxyl radicals are most commonly generated by [[photolysis]] of [[1-Hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione|1-hydroxy-2(1''H'')-pyridinethione]].

The hydroxyl radical is often referred to as the "detergent" of the [[troposphere]] because it reacts with many pollutants, decomposing them through "[[cracking (chemistry)#Chemistry|cracking]]", often acting as the first step to their removal. It also has an important role in eliminating some [[greenhouse gas]]es like [[methane]] and [[ozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[IPCC]] |title=Trends in the Hydroxyl Free Radical |quote=The hydroxyl free radical (OH) is the major oxidizing chemical in the atmosphere, destroying about 3.7 Gt of trace gases, including CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and all HFCs and HCFCs, each year (Ehhalt, 1999). |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |number=IPCC AR4 WG1 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reaction with the hydroxyl radical often determines how long many pollutants last in the atmosphere, if they do not undergo [[photolysis]] or are rained out. For instance methane, which reacts relatively slowly with hydroxyl radical, has an average lifetime of &gt;5 years and many [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s have lifetimes of 50 years or more. Other pollutants, such as larger [[hydrocarbons]], can have very short average lifetimes of less than a few hours.

The first reaction with many [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) is the removal of a [[hydrogen]] atom, forming water and an [[alkyl]] radical (R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;).
:&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + RH → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;
The alkyl radical will typically react rapidly with [[oxygen]] forming a [[peroxy]] radical.

:R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RO{{su|b=2|p=•}}

The fate of this radical in the [[troposphere]] is dependent on factors such as the amount of sunlight, pollution in the atmosphere and the nature of the [[alkyl]] radical that formed it.&lt;ref&gt;(See chapters 12 &amp; 13 in External Links "University Lecture notes on Atmospheric chemistry)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological significance==
Hydroxyl radicals can occasionally be produced as a byproduct of [[immune system|immune action]]. [[Macrophages]] and [[microglia]] most frequently generate this compound when exposed to very specific [[pathogens]], such as certain bacteria. The destructive action of hydroxyl radicals has been implicated in several [[neurological]] [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]] such as [[HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder|HAND]] when immune cells become over-activated and toxic to neighboring healthy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kincaid-Colton|first=Carol|author2=Wolfgang Streit|title=The Brain's Immune System|journal=Scientific American|date=November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydroxyl radical can damage virtually all types of macromolecules: carbohydrates, nucleic acids ([[mutation]]s), lipids ([[lipid peroxidation]]), and amino acids (e.g. conversion of [[Phenylalanine|Phe]] to ''m''-[[Tyrosine]] and ''o''-[[Tyrosine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|7776173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroxyl radical has a very short ''[[in vivo]]'' [[half-life]] of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and a high reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Importance in Earth's atmosphere==
The hydroxyl &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radical is one of the main chemical species controlling the oxidizing capacity of the global Earth atmosphere. This oxidizing reactive species has a major impact on the concentrations and distribution of greenhouse gases and pollutants in the Earth atmosphere. It is the most widespread oxidizer in the [[troposphere]], the lowest part of the atmosphere. Understanding &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH variability is important to evaluating human impacts on the atmosphere and climate. The &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH species has a lifetime in the Earth atmosphere of less than one second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This small variability is consistent with measurements of [[methane]] and other trace gases primarily oxidized by &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, as well as global photochemical model calculations.

In 2014, researchers reported their discovery of a "hole" or absence of hydroxyl throughout the entire depth of the [[troposphere]] across a large region of the tropical West Pacific. They suggested that this hole is permitting large quantities of [[ozone]]-degrading chemicals to reach the [[stratosphere]], and that this may be significantly reinforcing ozone depletion in the polar regions with potential consequences for the climate of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;["Like a giant elevator to the stratosphere", ''News Release'', Alfred Wegener Institute, April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy levels===
&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is a diatomic molecule. The electronic angular momentum along the molecular axis is +1 or −1, and the electronic spin angular momentum ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{1/2}}. Because of the orbit-spin coupling, the spin angular momentum can be oriented in parallel or anti arallel directions to the orbital angular momentum, producing the splitting into Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; and Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; states. The &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; ground state of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is split by lambda doubling interaction (an interaction between the nuclei rotation and the unpaired electron motion around its orbit). Hyperfine interaction with the unpaired spin of the proton further splits the levels.

===Chemistry of the molecule &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH===
In order to study gas phase interstellar chemistry, it is convenient to distinguish two types of interstellar clouds: diffuse clouds, with {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;= 30–100&amp;nbsp;K}} and {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10–1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and dense clouds, with {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;= 10–30&amp;nbsp;K}} and density {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|e=4}}–{{val|e=3|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. Ion chemical routes in both dense and diffuse clouds have been established for some works (Hartquist, ''Molecular Astrophysics'', 1990).

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH production pathways====
The &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radical is linked with the production of H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in molecular clouds. Studies of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH distribution in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1)&lt;ref name="HarjuWinnberg2000"&gt;{{citation |title=The distribution of OH in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 |bibcode=2000A&amp;A...353.1065H |last1=Harju |first1=J. |last2=Winnberg |first2=A. |last3=Wouterloot |first3=J. G. A. |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that in dense gas, &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is mainly formed by dissociative recombination of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Dissociative recombination is the reaction in which a molecular ion recombines with an electron and dissociates into neutral fragments. Important formation mechanisms for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH are:

{{NumBlk|:| H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|Dissociative recombination:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|1a}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Dissociative recombination:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|1b}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| {{chem|HCO|2|+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + CO|Dissociative recombination:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|2a}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;O + HCO → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + CO|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|3a}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H |Ion–molecular ion neutralization:{{spaces|10}}{{EquationRef|4a}}}}

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH destruction pathways====
Experimental data on association reactions of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH suggest that radiative association involving atomic and diatomic neutral radicals may be considered as an effective mechanism for the production of small neutral molecules in the interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name="FieldAdams1980"&gt;{{citation |title=Molecular synthesis in interstellar clouds - The radiative association reaction H + OH yields H2O + h/nu/ |bibcode=1980MNRAS.192....1F |last1=Field |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=N. G. |last3=Smith |first3=D. |year=1980|doi=10.1093/mnras/192.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in the gas phase via the neutral exchange reaction between O and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, which is also the main sink for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH in dense regions.&lt;ref name="HarjuWinnberg2000" /&gt;

We can see that atomic oxygen takes part both in the production and destruction of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, so the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH depends mainly on the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; abundance. Then, important chemical pathways leading from &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radicals are:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|1A}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Ion–neutral{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|2A}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;N → NO + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|3A}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + C → CO + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}}{{EquationRef|4A}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + photon|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|5A}}}}

====Rate constants and relative rates for important formation and destruction mechanisms====
Rate constants can be derived from the dataset published in a website.&lt;ref&gt;http://udfa.net&lt;/ref&gt; Rate constants have the form:

:{{math|''k''(''T'') {{=}} ''α''({{sfrac|''T''|300}})&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; × exp(−{{sfrac|''γ''|''T''}}) cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

Formation rates ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained using the rate constants ''k''(''T'') and the abundances of the reactants species C and D:

:{{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k''(''T'')&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt;[C][D]}}

where [Y] represents the abundance of the species Y. In this approach, abundances were taken from ''The UMIST database for astrochemistry 2006'', and the values are relatives to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; density. Following table shows the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; in order to get a view of the most important reactions.

The results suggest that (1a) reaction is the most prominent reaction in dense clouds. It is in concordance with Harju et al. 2000.

|}

Results shows that reaction 1A is the main sink for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH in dense clouds.

===Importance of interstellar &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH observations===
Discoveries of the microwave spectra of a considerable number of molecules prove the existence of rather complex molecules in the interstellar clouds, and provides the possibility to study dense clouds, which are obscured by the dust they contain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate=2009-01-13 |bibcode = 1964Natur.201..279D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH was observed by its rotational transitions at far infrared wavelengths, mainly in the Orion region. Because each rotational level of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is split in by lambda doubling, astronomers can observe a wide variety of energy states from the ground state.

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH as a tracer of shock conditions====
Very high densities are required to thermalize the rotational transitions of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Storey, J. W. V. |author2=Watson, D. M. |author3=Townes, C. H. | title=Detection of interstellar HO in the far-infrared
| journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters
| volume=244 |date=1981-02-15 |pages=L27–L30 |doi=10.1086/183472
| bibcode=1981ApJ...244L..27S }}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is difficult to detect far-infrared emission lines from a quiescent molecular cloud. Even at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; densities of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, dust must be optically thick at infrared wavelengths. But the passage of a shock wave through a molecular cloud is precisely the process which can bring the molecular gas out of equilibrium with the dust, making observations of far-infrared emission lines possible. A moderately fast shock may produce a transient raise in the &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH abundance relative to hydrogen. So, it is possible that far-infrared emission lines of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH can be a good diagnostic of shock conditions.

====In diffuse clouds====
Diffuse clouds are of astronomical interest because they play a primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21&amp;nbsp;cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when they are directed at low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: the thermal width of the hydrogen lines are of the same order as the internal velocities of structures of interest, so cloud components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. Molecular line observations in principle do not suffer from this problem. Unlike HI, molecules generally have [[excitation temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt;, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH are the most easily studied candidate molecules. CO has transitions in a region of the spectrum (wavelength &lt;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;mm) where there are not strong background continuum sources, but &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH has the 18&amp;nbsp;cm emission, line convenient for absorption observations.&lt;ref name="DickeyCrovisier1981"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Dickey, J. M. |author2=Crovisier, J. |author3=Kazes, I. | title=Emission-absorption observations of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HO in diffuse interstellar clouds |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics
| volume=98 |issue=2 |date=May 1981 |pages=271–285 |bibcode=1981A&amp;A....98..271D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation studies provide the most sensitive means of detections of molecules with subthermal excitation, and can give the opacity of the spectral line, which is a central issue to model the molecular region.

Studies based in the kinematic comparison of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH and HI absorption lines from diffuse clouds are useful in determining their physical conditions, specially because heavier elements provide higher velocity resolution.

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers====
&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH [[maser]]s, a type of [[astrophysical maser]], were the first masers to be discovered in space and have been observed in more environments than any other type of maser.

In the [[Milky Way]], &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers are found in stellar masers (evolved stars), interstellar masers (regions of massive star formation), or in the interface between supernova remnants and molecular material. Interstellar &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers are often observed from molecular material surrounding ultracompact [[H II region|H&amp;nbsp;II region]]s (UC H&amp;nbsp;II). But there are masers associated with very young stars that have yet to create UC H&amp;nbsp;II regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| bibcode=2003ApJ...593..925A |arxiv = astro-ph/0304565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This class of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers appears to form near the edges of very dense material, place where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O masers form, and where total densities drop rapidly and UV radiation form young stars can dissociate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. So, observations of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers in these regions, can be an important way to probe the distribution of the important H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule in interstellar shocks at high spatial resolutions.

====Application in water purification====
Hydroxyl radicals play a key role in the oxidative destruction of organic pollutant using a series of methodologies collectively known as [[advanced oxidation process]]es (AOPs).

==Country programmes==

For each partner country, the IGC supports a team of resident economists who respond to specific policy demands on issues of economic growth. This covers applied economic analysis, long-term research and policy engagement activities, as well as rapid responses to pressing policy questions.

The IGC [[Bangladesh]] programme was established in 2009. It is currently hosted in the [[BRAC University]] Institute of Governance and Development. The programme focuses on five areas of research: i) state effectiveness ii) firm capabilities iii) [[food security]] iv) [[infrastructure]] development, and v) sustainable [[urbanisation]] in Bangladesh. Professor [[Mushfiq Mobarak]] ([[Yale University]] and Professor Fahad Khalil ([[University of Washington]]) serve as Lead Academics for IGC Bangladesh. In 2014, IGC country researcher and former caretaker government adviser, Wahiduddin Mahmud addressed an IGC co-hosted  conference at BRAC University on the issue of dysfunctional governance in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = FE Report | title = Dysfunctional governance remains serious problem | url = http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/12/12/70638 | work = [[The Financial Express (Bangladesh)|The Financial Express]] | location = Bangladesh | date = 12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Ethiopia]] programme was established in 2010, in partnership with the Ethiopian Development Research Institute. IGC Ethiopia focuses on the following research areas: [[industrial development]], [[urbanisation]], developing [[agriculture]], [[youth unemployment]], and state effectiveness. In 2014 IGC Ethiopia jointly sponsored a small grants scheme for junior researchers with the Ethiopian Economics Association. In 2012, a study of youth unemployment in Ethiopia was conducted by the IGC which found that whilst unemployment in urban areas remains widespread, it has declined greatly since 1999. The same study also found that women have not benefited as much as men from reductions in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Broussar | first1 = Nzinga H. | last2 = Tekleselassie | first2 = Tsegay Gebrekidan  | title = Youth unemployment: Ethiopia country study | url = http://www.theigc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Broussar-Tekleselassie-2012-Working-Paper.pdf | format = pdf | id = 12/0592 | date = August 2012 |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its priority areas include [[natural resource management]] and [[monetary policy]], the [[regional integration]] process, raising [[income]] and [[inclusive growth]]. IGC Uganda research has included analysis of integration of economic activity within the [[East African Community]], the evolution of [[public expenditure]] priorities in light of [[natural resource]] revenues, and the options and strategies for financing fiscal deficits within the country. IGC research showed that eight out of ten Rwandan farmers in the study are not willing to adopt fertilisers as they are perceived as low quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barungi | first = Mildred |title=Substandard inputs are hindering technology adoption |url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35571 |work =[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]|publisher=Observer Media Ltd | location = Uganda | date = 18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Zambia]] programme started in 2010. It established its country office in 2011, located at the Zambian Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (ZIPAR). The IGC has collaborated with the Zambian Ministry of Health to test recruitment strategies for health workers in rural areas, which have now been implemented and scaled up by the Zambian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = The Financial | title = Improving the recruitment of community health workers in Zambia |url= http://finchannel.com/index.php/world/georgian-news/health-beauty/item/37803- | work =[[The Financial]] |publisher= Intelligence Group |date= 16 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGC has also engaged with the Zambia Revenue Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Online user | title = ZRA collects K27m in taxes | url = https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/?p=18311 | work = [[Zambia Daily Mail]] | publisher = [[Government of Zambia]] | date = 26 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research programmes==

IGC research is focused within four research themes: state, firms, [[cities]], and [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theigc.org/research-themes/ |title= Research themes | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC '''state''' research programme looks at the role of the public sector in economic development. Within the State research theme, the IGC has worked on 364 projects and organised 33 events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theigc.org/publication/our-work/ | title = Our work | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state research programme is headed by Professor [[Oriana Bandiera]] ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Henrik Kleven ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Eliana La Ferrera ([[Bocconi University]]), and Professor Gerard Padro i Miquel ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]).

One IGC state project run by [[Raj Chetty]] ([[Harvard University]]), Nasiruddin Ahmed ([[BRAC University]]), Ghulam Hossain (Chairman of the Pakistani [[National Board of Revenue]]), Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak ([[Yale University]]), Aminur Rahman ([[University of Virginia]]), and Monica Singhal ([[Harvard University]]) looked at how social recognition can be used to increase value-added tax revenue in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="mushfiqmobarak"&gt;{{cite web | last = Mobarak | first = Mushfiq |title=Tax compliance and social acclaim |url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/XwvGdsQDgePOLD6SFGXSTI/Tax-compliance-and-social-acclaim.html |work= [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] | publisher = [[HT Media]] | location = India | date = 15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers sent letters to inform firms that their tax compliance behaviour would be shared with other firms in their cluster in a subsequent letter. They hypothesised that this intervention may spur voluntary tax compliance by allowing firms to be recognised by their neighbours and peers. They found that in areas of low tax compliance, where less than 15% of firms paid any VAT the previous year (in 2012), the peer recognition treatment had no significant effect on tax payment rates. However, in areas where at least 15% of firms had paid VAT in 2012, firms who received the peer recognition treatment were 3.4 percentage points more likely to make a payment in the post-intervention period&lt;ref name="mushfiqmobarak"/&gt;

The IGC '''firms''' research programme seeks to understand the forces that determine the productivity of firms. Within the Firms research theme, the IGC has worked on 293 projects and organised 25 events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt; The IGC’s Firms research programme is headed by Professor [[Nicholas Bloom]] ([[Stanford University]]), Professor Tavneet Suri ([[MIT Sloan School of Management]]), Professor Christopher Udry ([[Yale University]]), Professor Eric Verhoogen ([[Columbia University]]), Dr Greg Fischer ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Imran Rasul ([[University College London]]), Professor Andres Rodriguez-Clare ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), and Professor Christopher Woodruff ([[University of Warwick]]).&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt;

An IGC firms project in [[Sialkot]], [[Pakistan]], one of the world’s top producers of footballs, found that employees in factories producing footballs resisted a new technology that limited waste and improved efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cronin | first = Brenda | title = How automation fell flat in the world’s soccer-ball capital |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/04/28/how-automation-fell-flat-in-the-worlds-soccer-ball-capital/ |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] | publisher = [[News Corp]] | date = 28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found a new way to cut the footballs' pentagon panels from sheets of [[rexine]], and they provided football manufacturers with a new cutting pattern and new cutting tools to implement the new design.&lt;ref name="newseditor"&gt;{{cite news |last = News Editor | url= http://finchannel.com/old/Main_News/B_Schools/130976_Pakistan%27s_football_factories_score_goal_for_innovation/|title= Pakistan's football factories score goal for innovation | work =[[The Financial]] |publisher= Intelligence Group | date = 30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While one of the largest companies in the city quickly adopted the new technology for almost all its production, few others followed suit. Based on further investigation, the researchers conjectured that take-up was slow because employees were resisting the new technology. Cutters were paid per piece, with no incentive to reduce waste, and were concerned that the new die would slow them down and reduce their incomes.&lt;ref name="newseditor"/&gt;

The IGC '''[[cities]]''' research programme explores the challenges of urbanisation in the developing world and the potential of cities to act as drivers of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bale | first = Jo |title=From cities to states |url= http://www.lse.ac.uk/alumni/LSEConnect/articlesSummer2014/fromCitiesToStates.aspx | website = lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[London School of Economics]] | date = Summer 2014 | quote = Jonathan Leape, new director of the International Growth Centre at LSE, explains the four research themes that will help power development in 15 countries across the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGC’s cities research programme is led by [[Edward Glaeser]] ([[Harvard University]]) and Gharad Bryan ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/rappaport/events-and-news/audio-and-video-clips/developing-world-cities-promise-and-challenge|title=Developing world cities: promise and challenge | website = hks.harvard.edu |publisher= [[Harvard Kennedy School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 projects and nine events have been funded through the IGC cities programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theigc.org/research-themes/cities/|title=Cities | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC '''[[energy]]''' research programme analyses the role that energy plays in shaping the growth of developing countries. Within the Energy research theme, the IGC has worked on 55 projects and organised four events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt; The energy programme is headed by Professor [[Michael Greenstone]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]) and Professor Nicholas Ryan ([[Yale University]]).&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt;

==Events==

The IGC holds a number of [http://www.theigc.org/events/ events] throughout the year with the purpose of discussing a wide range of economic growth-related issues, sharing the findings of its research, and stimulating policy debates within the IGC’s four thematic focus areas: cities, energy, state effectiveness, and firms.

IGC events focus on combining research and policy and feature speakers from IGC‘s network of researchers and policymakers from Africa and South Asia.

The IGC’s flagship events are “Growth Week”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/09/cut-poverty-africa-china-economic-boom-self-interest-development|title=Will giving fat cats some of the cream help to cut poverty?|date=2016-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2016/06/city-growth-asia-and-africa-examined-lse-conference|title=City growth in Asia and Africa examined at LSE conference {{!}} Public Finance|website=www.publicfinanceinternational.org|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; its annual conference in London, and a series of smaller regional and thematic conferences held in the UK, Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tralac.org/news/article/7998-africa-rising-the-new-growth-agenda.html|title=Africa rising: The new growth agenda|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tralac.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Asia with the aim of forging collaborations between policymakers and academics.

In addition, a number of in-country research dissemination and policy events and workshops are held every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/IGC-conference-Governor-calls-for-distributive-justice/articleshow/53244715.cms|title=IGC conference: Governor calls for 'distributive justice' - Times of India|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://novafrica.org/novafrica-conference-innovations-and-challenges-in-financial-development-in-mozambique/?lang=pt-pt|title=NOVAFRICA   » Conferência NOVAFRICA sobre o Desenvolvimento Financeiro em Moçambique – Inovação e Desafios|website=novafrica.org|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGC also holds a number of public lectures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kashmirlinklondon.co.uk/?p=6955|title=World should apply uniform standards on all terrorist incidents|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/dec/09/how-to-transform-the-lives-of-ultra-poor-women-new-evidence-from-brac-in-bangladesh|title=How to transform the lives of ultra-poor women: new evidence from Brac in Bangladesh|last=Green|first=Duncan|date=2015-12-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]].

'''Legislation''' (or "[[statutory law]]") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16849">[[File:Classic alphabet chart at coloring-pages-for-kids-boys-dotcom.svg|thumb|right|[[English alphabet]]. [[Letter (alphabet)|Letters]] form the basis for many [[languages]], including English]]

'''Linguistic Intelligence''' is a part of [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligence theory]] that deals with individuals' ability to understand both [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]], as well as their ability to speak and write themselves.  In a practical sense, linguistic intelligence is the extent to which an individual can use [[language]], both written and verbal, to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="FM 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Martinez|first=Fernando|author2=Kseniya Zablotskaya |author3=Wolfgang Minker |title=Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=Aug 2012|volume=39|issue=10|pages=9807–9820|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, high linguistic intelligence has been linked to improved [[problem solving]], as well as to increased [[Abstraction|abstract reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Luwel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luwel|first=Koen|author2=Ageliki Foustana |author3=Patrick Onghena |author4=Lieven Verschaffel |title=The role of verbal and performance intelligence in children's strategy selection and execution|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=Apr 2013|volume=24|pages=134–138|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, only the verbal aspects are taken into consideration. This is usually referred to as verbal intelligence or verbal fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.

==Physiologic and functional overview==
In order to understand linguistic intelligence, it is important to understand the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: [[speech|speech generation]] (talking), [[Hearing|speech comprehension]] (hearing), [[Writing|writing generation]] (writing), and [[Reading (process)|writing comprehension]] (reading).

Speech production is process by which a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohland|first=Jason|author2=Daniel Bullock |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural Representations and Mechanisms for the Performance of Simple Speech Sequences|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Jul 2010|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1504–1529|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21306|pmid=19583476|pmc=2937837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Haruka |author2=Sano, Kyutoku |author3=Oguro, Yokota |author4=Tsuzuki, Watanabe|title=Language-specific cortical activation patterns for verbal fluency tasks in Japanese as assessed by multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy|journal=Brain and Language|date=Aug 2013|volume=126|issue=2|pages=208–216|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2013.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodd|first=J.M. |author2=M.H.

The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt; This occurs primarily in the [[inferior frontal cortex]], specifically in an area known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konrad|first=Andreas|author2=Goran Vucurevic |author3=Francesco Musso |author4=Georg Winterer |title=VBM-DTI Correlates of Verbal Intelligence: A Potential Link to Broca's area|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Apr 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=888–895|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00187 |pmid=22220724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or [[phonemes]]. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the [[supplementary motor area]] plays a key role in this step.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Penfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-Mechanism|year=1959|publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the [[premotor cortex]] and the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

[[File:Human motor cortex topography.png|thumb|right|[[Motor cortex]] with muscle [[localization of function|localization]] shown]]
In most cases, speech production is controlled by the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, [[Wilder Penfield]], among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]]) and left-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|right-hemisphere dominant]]) patients. They discovered that, regardless of [[handedness]], the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural [[Stress (biology)|stress]] ([[hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.&lt;ref name=Doidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Doidge|first=Norman|title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehension ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
Verbal Comprehension is a fairly complex process, and it is not fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the [[superior temporal sulcus]] activates when hearing human speech, and that speech processing seems to occur within [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Auditory feedback and feedforward====
Hearing plays an important part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a [[feedback]] mechanism to fix [[speech error]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkell|first=Joseph|title=Movement goals and feedback and feed forward control mechanisms in speech production|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=Sep 2012|volume=25|issue=5|pages=382–407|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2010.02.011|pmc=3361736}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a single [[feedback]] correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt; This is apparent in some deaf people. [[Deafness]], as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it.&lt;ref name="Tourville 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tourville|first=Jason|author2=Kevin Reilly |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2008|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1429–1443|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism still helping to fix [[speech error]]s, even in the absence of [[auditory feedback]].&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt;

===Written language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Writing}}
Generation of written language is thought to be closely related to speech generation, relying on [[Broca's area]] for early processing and on the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead of relating the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the [[motor cortex]] activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Comprehension====
{{Main|Reading (process)|l1=Reading}}
Written comprehension, similar to spoken comprehension, seems to occur primarily in [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, instead of using the auditory system to gain language input, written comprehension relies on the visual system.

==Genetic links==
[[File:Protein NRXN1 PDB 1c4r.png|thumb|right|Protein NRXN1, which is created from the NRXN1 gene]]
While the capabilities of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several [[genes]] that have been linked to individual linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Adam|author2=Katalin Csiszar |title=Genetic insights into the functional elements of language|journal=Human Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=132|issue=9|pages=959–986|doi=10.1007/s00439-013-1317-0|pmid=23749164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRXN1]] gene has been linked to general language ability, and [[mutation]]s of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; The [[CNTNAP2]] gene is believed to affect [[language development]] and performance, and [[mutation]]s in this gene is thought to be involved in [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[PCDH11]] has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed to be one of the factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

==Measurement and testing==
In general, it is difficult to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore verbal intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of [[verbal fluency test]]s.&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CC 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals-Coll|first=M. |author2=Sanchez-Benavides |author3=Quintana |author4=Manero |author5=Rognoni |author6=Calvo |author7=Palomo |author8=Aranciva |author9=Tamayo |author10=Pena-Casanova |title=Spanish normative studies in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults project): Normative data: norms for verbal fluency tests|journal=Neurologia|date=Jan–Feb 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal fluency tests===
*[[Semantics|Semantic]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words in groups, such as animals, kitchen tools, fruits, etc. This type of test focuses on the subject's ability to generate words that have meaning to them. This test has been found to be sensitive to age.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Formal Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words given specific letter-based rules. This test has been found to be sensitive to education level.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Initial Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words starting with a specific letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Excluded Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words that do not contain a certain letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*[[Verb]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to list verbs. Subjects are then tested on their ability to use listed verbs.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Verbal Reproduction Test - Subjects are asked to listen to a [[monologue]]. They are then asked to repeat the monologue, and the subject is scored based on the number of words and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] used from the original monologue.&lt;ref name="FM 2012" /&gt;

===Verbal fluency in children===
In one series of tests, it was shown that when children were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] activated compared to adults, as well as activation of both the left and right hemispheres. This is most likely due to the high [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of newly developing brains.&lt;ref name="Gaillard 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaillard|first=W.D. |author2=Hertz-Pannier |author3=Mott |author4=Barnett |author5=LeBihan |author6=Theodore |title=Functional anatomy of cognitive development - fMRI of verbal fluency in children and adults|journal=Neurology|date=Jan 2000|volume=54|issue=1|pages=180–185|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible conflict===
Recently, a study was done showing that verbal fluency test results can differ depending on the mental focus of the subject. In this study, mental focus on physical [[speech production]] mechanisms caused speech production times to suffer, whereas mental focus on [[auditory feedback]] improved these times.&lt;ref name="Lisman 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisman|first=Amanda|author2=Neeraja, Sadagopan |title=Focus of attention and speech motor performance|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=46|issue=3|pages=281–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders affecting linguistic intelligence==
{{Main|Speech-language pathology}}
Since linguistic intelligence is based on several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's linguistic intelligence.

===Injuries===
Damage and injury in the brain can severely lower one's ability to communicate, and therefore lower one's linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are [[strokes]], [[concussions]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[Virus|viral]]/[[bacteria]]l damage, and [[drug]]-related damage. The three major [[Language disorder|linguistic disorders]] that result from these injuries are [[aphasia]], [[alexia (condition)|alexia]], and [[agraphia]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the inability to speak, and can be caused by damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to [[Wernicke's area]], among other places.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Agraphia]] is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

===Pure language disorders===
There are several disorders that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[stuttering]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI) is a disorder where the patient has a lack of [[language acquisition]] skills, despite a seemingly normal [[intelligence]] level in other areas.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Stuttering]] is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

===Other disorders affecting language===
Some disorders cause a wide array of effects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible [[symptom]]s. The two major disorders of this type are  [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Autism]] and other [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased [[social skills]] and lowered [[Cognitive flexibility|mental flexibility]]. As a result, many patients suffering from ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Epilepsy]] is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], leading to muscle [[spasm]]s and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5249">[[Image:Tampereen tuomikirkko kesä 2004 IMG 2328.JPG|thumb|270px|right|National Romantic style in [[Finland]] — [[Tampere Cathedral]].]]
The '''National Romantic style''' was a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] architectural style that was part of the [[Romantic nationalism|National Romantic movement]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is often considered to be a form of [[Art Nouveau]].

==History==
The National Romantic style spread across [[Finland]]; the Scandinavian countries of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]; the Baltic countries of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], as well as [[Russia]] (mainly [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]). Unlike much nostalgic [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] architecture elsewhere, National Romantic architecture expressed progressive social and political ideals, through reformed domestic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, ''National Romanticism and Modern Architecture in Germany and the Scandinavian Countries'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 2000:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designers turned to early [[medieval architecture]] and even prehistoric precedents to construct a style appropriate to the perceived character of a people. The style can be seen as a reaction to industrialism and an expression of the same "Dream of the North" nationalism that gave impetus to renewed interest in the [[edda]]s and [[saga]]s.

== Examples==

* [[Copenhagen City Hall]] ''(Københavns Rådhus)'' (1905, Denmark)
* [[Finnish National Theatre]] ''(Suomen Kansallisteatteri)'' (1902, Finland)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Neo-Fauvism''' was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Kim. ''Surrealism and the Visual Arts: Theory and Reception'', [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521836555&amp;ss=exc Introduction]. Cambridge University Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83655-5}}, {{ISBN|0-521-83655-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

==In the law==

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887] published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. The McCarthyites 'never produced a single Communist spy whose guilt was proved in court.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; 'I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay'. the Fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-incrimination ==
{{main|Self-incrimination}}
In the UK case ''Hale'', 2 P. C. 290 (n), the defendant was alleged to have murdered his niece, who had cried out 'good uncle do not kill me', and then was seen no more. The defendant, asked to produce the girl in court, had fraudulently produced another girl disguised as the niece. The court presumed him guilty on this basis and he was executed. Later, the niece was found, alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=TC | last=Granger | title=A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases | publisher=Benning and co | year=1846 | page=18 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ifFiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hale,+2P.C.290(n)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCEInjyO8T&amp;sig=vdmOWhomV6cRdpLo4JCG7pkCPVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8-LyF5ZPZAhWywVkKHbOrCZ0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%2C%202P.C.290(n)&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual violence and harassment ==

The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, 'put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence'. Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a 'golden thread', is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)]], 'Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?', ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017. [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oneill-presumption-innocent-sex-harassment-20171116-story.html]. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence. &lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], 'Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge', Daily Express, 24 December 2017. [https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/896348/police-rape-case-collapse-high-court-judge-officer-training-presumption-of-guilt]. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of [[False accusation of rape|false rape allegations]], but it is generally agreed that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M. ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisak, David; Gardinier, Lori; Nicksa, Sarah C.; Cote, Ashley M. (2010).

In March 2017 Elizabeth Truss, Justice Secretary, said "that from September juries across the country will watch the pre-recorded cross-examinations during a trial".&lt;ref&gt;Laura Hughes, "Rape victims to be spared court cross-examination as Government brings forward plans for pre-recorded video evidence".

In 1990, Yale professor and [[radical feminist]] [[Catharine MacKinnon]], is alleged to have addressed a graduation crowd thus; 'look about you. Statistics tell us you have just laid eyes on someone guilty of sexual assault'.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Taylor Jr and KC Johnson, ''Until Proven Innocent'', St Martin's Press, 2013, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1989 book ''Towards a Feminist Theory of the State'' she alleged that 'all sex is akin to rape'.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Taylor Jr and KC Johnson, ''Until Proven Innocent'', chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationally==

In [[China]] there has been a 'spate of wrongful convictions' and alleged misconduct by police and prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kaiman]], 'China Suspects presumed guilty until proven innocent', [[The Guardian]], 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]], a suspect arrested after the July 2016 coup attempt was asked to pay his defence lawyer $80,000, reflecting the cost to the lawyer's career; he would be thrown off the bar. 'Bogus and ludicrous charges' and confessions obtained under torture, were allegedly widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macit Ferhan]], 'In Turkey, You are Guilty until proven Innocent', The Globe Post, 7 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]] the criminal justice system has been criticized for its wide use of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]], suspects were forced to make false confessions during interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keiji Hirano]], 'Justice system flawed by presumed guilt', [[The Japan Times]], 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

* According to all four Gospels Jesus, though tried by Pontius Pilate and found to be a 'just man' with 'no fault in him', was condemned to death by the multitude who cried 'crucify him' &lt;ref&gt; Matthew, ch 27, Mark, ch 15, Luke, ch 23, John ch 18 &lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Crime of the Century (1996 film)]], starring [[Stephen Rea]], was a TV docudrama which presented Richard Hauptmann as an innocent man wrongly convicted.
* ''Presumed Guilty'' is a 1993 thriller by [[Tess Gerritsen]] in which a woman is wrongly accused of murdering her lover.
* ''Presumption of Guilt'' is a novel by [[Archer Mayor]] in which detective Joe Gunther investigates a forty-year-old murder case.
* The [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Making a Murderer]]'' details the murder trials of [[Steven Avery]] and [[Brendan Dassey]] in which the presumption of innocence was 'deeply compromised'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Dolan]], 'The Presumption of innocence doesn't apply to my child', [[Washington Post]], 21 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantitative marketing research''' is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing. It has roots in both the [[positivism|positivist]] view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the "[[Marketing mix|four Ps]]" of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.

As a [[social research]] method, it typically involves the construction of [[questionnaire]]s and [[scale (social sciences)|scales]]. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the [[statistical survey|survey]]. [[Marketing|Marketers]] use the information to obtain and understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create [[strategic planning|strategies]] and [[marketing plan]]s.

==Typical general procedure==
Simply put, there are five major and important steps involved in the research process:

#Defining the problem.
#[[Experimental design|Research design]].
#[[Data collection]].
#[[Data analysis]].
#[[Report writing]] &amp; presentation.

A brief discussion on these steps is:

# Problem audit and problem definition - What is the problem? What are the various aspects of the problem? What information is needed?
# Conceptualization and operationalization - How exactly do we define the concepts involved? How do we translate these concepts into observable and measurable behaviours?
# [[Hypothesis]] specification - What claim(s) do we want to test?
# Research design specification - What type of methodology to use? - examples: questionnaire, survey
# [[questionnaire construction|Question specification]] - What questions to ask? In what order?
# [[scale (social sciences)|Scale specification]] - How will preferences be rated?
# [[sampling (statistics)|Sampling design]] specification - What is the total population? What sample size is necessary for this population? What sampling method to use?- examples: '''Probability Sampling:-''' ([[cluster sampling]], [[stratified sampling]], [[simple random sampling]], [[multistage sampling]], [[systematic sampling]]) &amp; '''[[Nonprobability sampling]]:-''' (Convenience Sampling, Judgement Sampling, Purposive Sampling, Quota Sampling, Snowball Sampling, etc. )
# Data collection - Use mail, telephone, internet, mall intercepts
# Codification and re-specification - Make adjustments to the raw data so it is compatible with statistical techniques and with the objectives of the research - examples: assigning numbers, consistency checks, substitutions, deletions, weighting, dummy variables, scale transformations, scale standardization
# Statistical analysis - Perform various descriptive and inferential techniques (see below) on the raw data. Make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Test the results for statistical significance.
# Interpret and integrate findings - What do the results mean? What conclusions can be drawn? How do these findings relate to similar research?
# Write the research report - Report usually has headings such as: 1) executive summary; 2) objectives; 3) methodology; 4) main findings; 5) detailed charts and diagrams. Present the report to the client in a 10-minute presentation. Be prepared for questions.

The design step may involve a pilot study in order to discover any hidden issues. The codification and analysis steps are typically performed by computer, using [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].  The data collection steps, can in some instances be automated, but often require significant manpower to undertake.  Interpretation is a skill mastered only by experience.

==Statistical analysis==

The data acquired for quantitative marketing research can be analysed by almost any of the range of techniques of [[statistical analysis]], which can be broadly divided into [[descriptive statistics]] and [[statistical inference]]. An important set of techniques is that related to [[statistical survey]]s. In any instance, an appropriate type of statistical analysis should take account of the various types of error that may arise, as outlined below.

===Reliability and validity===

Research should be tested for [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], generalizability, and [[validity (psychometric)|validity]].

'''Generalizability''' is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population.

'''Reliability''' is the extent to which a measure will produce consistent results.
* ''Test-retest reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient.
* ''Alternative forms reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms.
* ''Internal consistency reliability'' checks how well the individual measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.

'''Validity''' asks whether the research measured what it intended to.
* ''Content validation'' (also called face validity) checks how well the content of the research are related to the variables to be studied; it seeks to answer whether the research questions are representative of the variables being researched. It is a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.
* ''Criterion validation'' checks how meaningful the research criteria are relative to other possible criteria. When the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity.
* ''Construct validation'' checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity: ''convergent validity'' (how well the research relates to other measures of the same construct), ''discriminant validity'' (how poorly the research relates to measures of opposing constructs), and ''nomological validity'' (how well the research relates to other variables as required by theory).
* ''Internal validation'', used primarily in experimental research designs, checks the relation between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. Did the experimental manipulation of the independent variable actually cause the observed results?)
* ''External validation'' checks whether the experimental results can be generalized.

Validity implies reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability does not necessarily imply validity, however: A reliable measure does not imply that it is valid.

===Types of errors===

'''Random sampling errors:'''
*sample too small
*sample not representative
*inappropriate sampling method used
*[[errors and residuals in statistics|random errors]]
'''Research design errors:'''
*bias introduced
*measurement error
*data analysis error
*sampling frame error
*population definition error
*scaling error
*question construction error
'''Interviewer errors:'''
*recording errors
*cheating errors
*questioning errors
*respondent selection error
'''Respondent errors:'''
*non-response error
*inability error
*falsification error
'''Hypothesis errors:'''
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|type I error]] (also called alpha error)
**the study results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis even though it is actually true
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] (also called beta error)
**the study results lead to the acceptance (non-rejection) of the null hypothesis even though it is actually false

In the traditional theory of music, a '''regular temperament''' is an assignment of relative [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es to the notes of the [[chromatic scale]] (i.e. a ''[[musical tuning|tuning]]'' of this scale),&lt;ref&gt;The relative pitches assigned to this scale are naturally inherited by its subscales—the [[diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|diatonic major]] scales and their [[relative minor]]s and its [[pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|pentatonic subscales]], for instance. All regular temperaments other than [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]] and its derivatives also naturally generate relative pitch assignments for extra notes which can be (and have been) used to create extensions of the chromatic scale to more than 12 notes.&lt;/ref&gt; in which every interval of a [[perfect fifth]]&lt;ref&gt;Premises of this definition are that octaves are untempered—that is, the frequencies of their end-points are in the ratio of 2 to 1—, that every octave is identically divided by notes selected from the same set of [[pitch class]]es and that a "perfect fifth" is the interval between the first and fifth [[scale degree]]s of a [[diatonic major scale]], however tuned. Equivalently, it is the interval formed by juxtaposing 4 [[diatonic semitone]]s and 3 [[chromatic semitone]]s,  or  the interval between the notes sounded by two keys separated by 6 others on a standard [[musical keyboard]], not necessarily tuned according to the now standard [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]], and with the proviso that if the upper note is a flat then so is the lower, and if the lower note is a sharp then so is the upper.  The term "perfect" is used here solely to distinguish the interval referred to from [[augmented fifth|augmented]] and [[diminished fifth#Augmented fourth and diminished fifth|diminished fifth]]s (such as the interval between B and F), and does not imply that the fifth has to be [[Just intonation|just]].&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Musical temperament|tempered]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, has had the frequency ratio between its end-points adjusted to be close to, but not exactly equal to, its just value of 3/2.  The purpose of this tempering is commonly to reduce the frequency ratio between the end-points of the  [[major third]]s and [[minor sixth]]s and increase that between the end-points of the [[minor third]]s and [[major sixth]]s so that they are closer to their just values of 5/4, 5/3, 6/5 and 8/5 respectively.  In practice, this means that the frequency ratio between the end-points of the tempered fifths will normally be less than 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt; by the same amount.&lt;ref&gt;Bergholt ([[#CITEREFBergholt1895|1895]]; 212, p.510; 214, p.637), Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.163); Panetta ([[#CITEREFLPanetta1987|1987]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OoyCpZhaxQ4C&amp;pg=PA15 p.15]); Lindley &amp; Turner-Smith ([[#CITEREFLindleyTurner-Smith1993|1993]], p.43); Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n13/mode/1up xi], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/32/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 32–44]); Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]); Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], pp.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA39 39], 33–46); Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]); Di Veroli ([[#CITEREFDi Veroli2013|2013]], p.42); Dolata ([[#CITEREFDolata2016|2016]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DdQ4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 p.98]). Lindley ([[#CITEREFLindley1984|1984]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oXE5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]), Lindley, ([[#CITEREFLindley2001|2001]], p.249) and Jorgensen ([[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]] , p.776)  use the term "regular meantone temperament" to refer to the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tuning in which all the perfect fifths remain untempered&lt;ref&gt;That is, the frequency ratio between their end-points has its [[Just intonation|just value]] of 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt;  is called "[[Pythagorean tuning]]".  In this article, unless the context implies otherwise, the unqualified term "fifth" by itself will mean "perfect fifth".

Authorities differ as to which tunings they regard as being included amongst those they refer to as "temperaments", and therefore as to whether or not they include Pythagorean tuning amongst those they refer to as "regular temperaments". Some treat the term "temperament" as a synonym for "tuning",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/431/mode/1up 431], [https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/433/mode/1up 433]), Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]), and Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.162), for instance. Bosanquet defines "temperament" to mean "the division of the octave", and takes the division produced by what he calls the "Pythagorean system" to be one instance of this.&lt;/ref&gt; others reserve the term "temperament" for tunings that are not any form of [[just intonation]] (including Pythagorean tuning),&lt;ref&gt;Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA38 38]) and Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]), for example.&lt;/ref&gt; and one eminent musicologist, [[James Murray Barbour]], required a temperament to have at least one interval with an [[irrational number|irrational]] frequency ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up pp.xii], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/5/mode/1up 5]). Although Barbour, somewhat inconsistently, seems to include Pythagorean tuning amongst the ones he refers to as "regular temperaments".&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, all regular temperaments and Pythagorean tuning are collectively referred to as "regular tunings".&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1876|1876]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n83/mode/1up 60], [[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]) uses the expression "regular system" rather than "regular tuning" for the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt; Tunings and temperaments which include perfect fifths of different sizes are called "irregular".

In the [[diatonic]] scales of [[Common practice period|common practice]] Western music, any note is either separated from another by a whole number of perfect fifths, or is in the same [[pitch class]] as such a note.&lt;ref&gt;That is, it differs from such a note by a whole number of octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;
In these scales, therefore, the interval between any pair of notes can be formed  either by adding a whole number of fifths to, or subtracting them from, a whole number of [[octave]]s, or by subtracting a whole number of octaves from a whole number of fifths.  A regular tuning of such scales, therefore, can be constructed from a single [[circle of fifths|chain of fifths]],  the pitch of any note being determined by that of a single reference note and the common size of all the perfect fifths.  There are, however, some more extended scales for which the construction of regular tunings requires two or more chains of fifths offset from each other by intervals which cannot be formed from combinations of whole numbers of fifths and octaves.

A modified concept of regular tuning has been proposed by some modern musical theorists, who define it to be a general system of music intervals produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes, not necessarily including a fifth or an  octave.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;See, for example, Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]] and [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of regular temperaments are [[meantone temperament]]s and [[equal temperament]]s.

== Description and examples ==
In the chromatic scale of [[Western culture#music|western music]], the perfect fifths are the intervals between any two successive notes in the following list:

{{centre| F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,}}

or its extension to include notes with more flats or sharps.  An assignment of pitches to these notes, and others in the same pitch classes, is a regular tuning if the intervals between pairs of successive notes in the list are all the same size.  The tuning is Pythagorean if the intervals are all [[just intonation|just]]  perfect fifths, or is a regular temperament if they are tempered fifths.

Denote the size of the fifth, as a fraction of an octave, by ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the size of each fifth is 1200''f'' cents, and the frequency ratio between its end-points is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   For the fifths to qualify as tempered, ''f'' must be close, but not exactly equal,  to its just value of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3/2)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Where &amp;nbsp;{{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}&amp;nbsp;, for any positive &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;, is the [[binary logarithm]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/ref&gt;   To preserve the proper pitch ordering of the notes within each octave,&lt;ref&gt;Here specified using [[scientific pitch notation]], in which the subscript indicates the octave to which the note belongs, with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; being [[middle C]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{center|C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt; B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;, }}
it must also satisfy the inequalities, 4/7 &lt; ''f'' &lt; 3/5.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood ([[#CITEREFBlackwood1985|1985]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=0LL_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200 200–1]); Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.22]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In such a regular tuning, the common size of the intervals E–F and B–C, the [[diatonic semitone]], is 3 − 5''f'' of an octave.  The common size of the intervals between the flattened version of a note and the note itself, or between the note itself and its sharpened version, the [[chromatic semitone]], is 7''f'' − 4 of an octave.
The common size of the intervals C–D, D–E, F–G, G–A and A–B, the [[whole tone]], is the sum of the diatonic and chromatic semitones, or 2''f'' − 1 of an octave.   The diatonic semitone is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, the chromatic semitone according as ''f'' is less than, greater than,  or equal to, 7/12.  In the last case, the diatonic and chromatic semitones are both 1/12 of an octave, exactly half the size of a tone, and the tuning is [[12-tone equal temperament]].

Unless ''f'' = 7/12, as in  12-tone equal temperament, the first five notes in the list above, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, will not belong to the same [[pitch class]]es as the last five, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore not be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] to them.  If ''f'' &gt; 7/12, each sharp is 12''f'' − 7 of an octave sharper than its otherwise enharmonically equivalent flat, whereas, if ''f'' &lt; 7/12,  it is 7 − 12''f'' of an octave flatter. On a standard [[musical  keyboard]], with only the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in each octave, only one note from each of the enharmonically alternative  pairs, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  can be assigned to any one of the appropriate black keys.   The assignments traditionally chosen were either F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, or F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/25/mode/1up 25–44]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of the intervals G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; (and of the other  [[diminished sixth]]s, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F)  is 7 − 11''f''  of an octave.  For most of  the regular temperaments used in practice in the past, these intervals were too [[consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonant]] to perform acceptably as perfect fifths, and were then referred to pejoratively as "[[wolf interval]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA215 215]). Sometimes also called "wolf fifths", despite their really being diminished sixths (Jorgensen [[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]], p.10; Donahue, [[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.23;  Barbour, [[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up xii]).&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular tuning is obtained by selecting the desired size of the perfect fifths &lt;ref&gt;Here taken to be measured in octaves and fractions of an octave.   Mathematically, the size of an interval in this sense is the base-2 logarithm of the frequency ratio between its end-points, or equivalently, &amp;nbsp;''s''/1200&amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp; is its size in [[cent (music)|cent]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; and constructing one or more chains of fifths, in which the upper end-point of each fifth is the same as the lower end-point of the next one in the same chain.  The scale to be tuned  comprises all the notes belonging to the same pitch classes as those at the end-points of the fifths in all the chains.  If an end-point of one of the fifths in each chain is taken as a reference, the pitches of all the notes of the scale relative to those references can be determined by travelling in either direction by a whole number of fifths along the appropriate chain, starting from its reference, and then moving up or down by a whole number of octaves.   When there is more than one chain, the pitches of the notes in one chain relative to those of another are completely determined by any single interval between any pair of notes, of which one belongs to the first chain and the other to the second.

===Examples===
If a chain of twelve fifths starts from the note A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, the notes at the ends of successive fifths in the chain will be:
{{centre| A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

If the G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;  at the end of the chain is not in the same [[pitch class]] as the A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; at its start, then extending the chain upwards will produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.35em;"&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc., and extending it downwards will similarly produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.6em;"&gt;&amp;#x266d;&amp;#x266d;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc.  The following tables give the sizes in fractions of an octave of the intervals between the note C at the start of an octave and each of the naturals, sharps and flats within the octave immediately above it when it is tuned with a regular tuning whose fifth is a fraction {{math|''f''}} of an octave.  The columns of the tables are ordered according to the sizes of the corresponding intervals.

:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7 }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[pythagorean comma|ditonic (i.e. Pythagorean) comma]], equivalent to about 23.5 cents.
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[schisma]], equivalent to about 1.95 cents.

====12-tone equal temperament====
:When ''f'' = 7/12, as it is in the now standard 12-tone equal temperament, the total span of twelve fifths will be exactly 7 octaves, the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; will belong to the same pitch classes as F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, and the diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F  will be the same size, 7/12 of an octave, as the perfect fifths.

====Other equal temperaments====
:'''a.''' When ''f'' =  ''m/n'', a [[rational numbers|rational]] [[fraction (mathematics)#Simple, common, or vulgar fractions|fraction]] of an octave, where ''m'' and ''n'' are positive integers [[Coprime integers|with no proper common factor]], then ''n'' of those fifths will span exactly ''m'' octaves, and a chain of that many fifths will generate a scale of ''n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at intervals of 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of an octave.   The resulting temperament is called "''n''-tone equal temperament".  If  {{math| ''m/n'' ≠ 7/12}}, the pitch class of each sharp will be ''different'' from that of its enharmonically alternative flat, and separated from it by an interval of {{math|{{!}} 12 ''m/n'' − 7 {{!}}}} of an octave.   Examples include [[17 equal temperament|17-tone]], [[19 equal temperament|19-tone]], [[22 equal temperament|22-tone]], [[31 equal temperament|31-tone]],  [[41 equal temperament|41-tone]] and  [[53 equal temperament|53-tone]] equal temperaments, with fifths of sizes 10/17, 11/19, 13/22, 18/31, 24/41 and 31/53 of an octave respectively.

:'''b.''' If a whole number, ''r'', of interleaved chains of fifths, of the same size, ''m/n'' of an octave, as above, are offset from one another by intervals of 1/(''r n'') of an octave, they will generate a scale of ''r n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at that same interval, thus producing an ''r n''-tone equal temperament.   Examples include [[24 equal temperament|24-tone]], [[34 equal temperament|34-tone]] and [[58 equal temperament|58-tone]] equal temperaments, each with two interleaved chains of fifths of sizes 7/12, 10/17 and 17/29 of an octave respectively, and [[72 equal temperament|72-tone]] equal temperament with 6 interleaved chains of fifths of size 7/12 of an octave.

====Pythagorean tuning and schismic temperament====
:When all the fifths are Pythagorean—that is, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{=}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—the total span of twelve fifths is larger than 7 octaves by the Pythagorean comma, which is more than a quarter of this tuning's diatonic semitone.&lt;ref&gt;And nearly a quarter of the semitone of 12-tone equal temperament.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are flatter than the fifth by this amount, sufficient for them to qualify as wolves.

:Apart from the presence of wolves, Pythagorean tuning has the disadvantage that its normal thirds and sixths are quite dissonant.  Its  major thirds, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–C, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–G, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D, F–A, C–E, G–B, D–F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A–C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  for instance, are wider than just by a syntonic comma, as are its major sixths, and its normal minor sixths and  thirds are correspondingly narrower than just by the same amount, which is too large for any of these intervals to be recognised as [[consonance and dissonance#Consonance|consonance]]s.  The diminished fourths, E–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, on the other hand, are narrower than just major thirds by only a schisma, thus making them reasonably consonant.  By extending the tuning as far as the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), or D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), each note of the chromatic scale can be made to serve as the bass for reasonably good thirds and sixths, as indicated in the following table:

:The names given in parentheses in this table are those assigned to the corresponding intervals by traditional musical terminology, where the degree assigned to an interval is determined by the number of letter-named notes included in it.

:[[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]] gave the name "[[schismatic temperament|skhismic temperament]]"&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).  Now usually spelt "schismic".&lt;/ref&gt; to a Pythagorean tuning whose thirds and sixths were regarded as being  the intervals given in the above  table, rather than the ones those names would refer to in traditional musical terminology.

====Quarter-comma meantone====
:In [[quarter-comma meantone]], the size of the perfecf fifths,  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} {{=}} {{sfrac|(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2)|4}} }}, is chosen so that four of them span an interval of two octaves plus a just [[major third]], thus making all the major thirds and minor sixths of the resulting scale perfectly just.  The  total span of twelve of these fifths is less than 7 octaves by the so-called [[lesser diesis]], which is about 40% of an equal-temperament semitone.   The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are sharper than the fifth by this amount, which is again sufficient for these intervals to qualify as wolves.   The title "quarter-comma meantone" derives from the fact that the size of the fifth in this temperament is smaller than its just value by a quarter of the syntonic comma.&lt;!--- which is the amount, 4 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5) − 4 of an octave, by which four just fifths exceed two octaves plus a just major third. --&gt;

====Other meantones====

:If ''q'' is a positive rational fraction, a regular temperament with fifths of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''q c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—that is,  a multiple ''q'' of a syntonic comma smaller than their just size of   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—is commonly referred to as "''q''-comma meantone".   Fractions other than 1/4 which have been suggested as possible values for ''q'' are 1/3, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, 2/7, 2/9, 3/10 and 5/18.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/31/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 31–44])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Helmholtzian temperament====
:A regular tuning with a fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}}&amp;nbsp;, and with the thirds and sixths identified with the intervals specified by the scheme of [[#table2|table 2]] is called "Helmholtzian temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).&lt;/ref&gt;   In this temperament, the major thirds and minor sixths, as given by the scheme of table 1, are perfectly just,  while the fifths and minor thirds are flatter than just, and the fourths and major sixths sharper than just, by the imperceptible amount of an eighth of a schisma.

== More recent alternative concept ==

In the traditional definition of regular tuning, it is taken for granted that the perfect fifth whose size is being fixed by the tuning is that of the diatonic major scale of common practice Western music.   A regular tuning in this sense is thus inextricably tied to the structure of that scale and others closely associated with it.  It is a much less useful concept for other styles  of music whose scales cannot be straightforwardly derived from the diatonic.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich ([[#CITEREFErlich2006|2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Some musical theorists have recently proposed an alternative definition of regular tuning which can be applied to a wider range of musical styles.  According to this alternative definition, a regular tuning is a collection of intervals which can be produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; For the purposes of the definition, an interval is regarded as being completely determined by just its size and direction (ascending or descending), independent of any specific range of pitches which it might span, with a descending interval being regarded as the negative of an ascending one of the same size.  Thus, the intervals between any of the pairs of notes [C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., in 12-tone equal temperament, for example, are considered to be merely separate instantiations of the ''same'' interval—an ascending tempered major third of size one-third of an octave—, and the intervals between the pairs [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., to be instantiations of its negative—a ''descending'' tempered major third of the same size.  An ascending interval in this sense can therefore be represented by a single number that specifies it size, and a descending one by the negative of the number specifying its size.

A regular tuning in this alternative sense is not required to contain octaves or perfect fifths, or to be usable for tuning any of the usual scales of common practice music, and will therefore not necessarily be obtainable as the set of intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense.  The collection of intervals that  can be produced by combining together octaves, just perfect fifths and just major thirds,&lt;ref&gt;That is, the collection of all [[5-limit tuning|5-limit intervals]].&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, although a regular tuning according to this alternative definition, cannot be the set of intervals of any tuning that is regular under the traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;Any tuning of a diatonic scale which contains both a just perfect fifth and a just major third must always contain perfect fifths of at least two different sizes. If the major third C–E is perfectly just, for example, then at least one of the fifths C–G, G–D, D–A or A–E cannot be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of this article, the term "regular tuning", unless otherwise qualified, will be used in this alternative  sense.

Intervals that can be combined together to produce all the other intervals of a given regular tuning are called "generators" of the tuning. Any interval of such a tuning must have the form  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are generators for it, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are integers. The minimum number of non-zero generators needed to produce all the intervals of the tuning is called its "rank",&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt; and regular tunings of rank 2 are called "linear".   The collection of ''all'' intervals obtainable by combining together the generators of a regular tuning has the mathematical structure of a [[Free abelian group#Rank|free abelian group]] of the same rank.  The theory of these groups can  therefore be useful for investigating the properties of regular tunings.

===Examples===

====The intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense====
[[Image:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Some examples of linear tunings generated by an octave and a perfect fifth, generally tempered (Milne et al., [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.18]).]]
The intervals of any regular tuning in the traditional sense can be obtained by combining together its perfect fifth, a pure octave, and possibly some intervals separating chains of fifths that may be offset from one another.  That set of Intervals is therefore a regular tuning in the alternative sense.  The set of intervals of an equal temperament—in which just one size of interval is needed to produce all the others—has rank 1.  Since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning and meantone and Helmholtzian temperaments can be produced from their fifths and the octave, but not from any intervals of just one size, those sets of intervals have rank 2, and are therefore linear.

====''p''-limit tuning and just intonation====

An interval obtainable as a combination of generators whose  sizes in octaves are all of the form {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}}, with all {{math|''q''}}  being prime numbers no greater than some fixed prime {{math|''p''}}, is called a "[[limit (music)#Prime limit|''p''-limit interval]]", and a regular tuning is called a ''p''-limit tuning if all its intervals are ''p''-limit intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Wright ([[#CITEREFWright2009|2009]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=g4ONAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 137]).  As thus defined, a ''p''-limit tuning is automatically also a ''q''-limit tuning for any other prime ''q'' greater than&amp;nbsp;''p''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning are generated by the octave, of size one (i.e. {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}) octave, and the just perfect twelfth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}} octaves, they form a 3-limit tuning.  Likewise, the set of intervals generated by the octave, a just perfect twelfth, and a just major seventeenth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves, constitutes a 5-limit tuning.  Since this set of intervals cannot be generated by any smaller collection of generators, it is a regular tuning of rank 3.

In just intonation, the pair of notes forming every consonance has a frequency ratio whose numerator and denominator are small whole numbers.  As a consequence, these intervals must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime {{math|''p''}}.   Thus, the intervals of Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale|syntonic diatonic scale]], for instance, in which the relative pitches of the notes are completely determined by the requirement that all  three of its  [[primary triad]]s be perfectly just [[major chord]]s, form a 5-limit tuning, since they can be generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves.

By going one step further, to proper [[7-limit tuning]]s,&lt;ref&gt;That is, to one which does in fact contain an interval of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;  it is possible to obtain regular tunings with perfectly just septimal intervals.  The regular tuning generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves, for instance, is a 7-limit tuning of rank 4 which contains perfectly just [[harmonic seventh]] intervals of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{frac|7|4}})}} octaves, as well as perfect fourths and fifths, and major and minor thirds and sixths which are all perfectly just.

===Temperament mappings===
By definition, a tempered interval is one which is  very nearly—but not quite—just.  Thus, if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all either tempered or just intervals of a regular tuning, there must be some just intervals, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, such that &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all very close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Or equal to zero whenever the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; happens to be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ,}} and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are all just, they must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime ''p''.   If they are all distinct, and there is no interval which can be expressed in two or more different ways as a combination of them,&lt;ref&gt;If this is the case, the intervals &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are said to be "''independent''".&lt;/ref&gt; then the association of the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, for each ''r''-tuple, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers, defines a mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the ''p''-limit tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; onto the regular tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  This function, which turns out to be a useful tool for the construction of tunings with desired properties, is called a ''temperament mapping''.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
=====For the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament=====
The only just interval of 12-tone equal temperament is the octave.  Its tempered intervals are its  perfect fourth and fifth, and its major and minor third and sixth, whose sizes in octaves are {{frac|5|12}},{{frac|7|12}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|2|3}}, respectively. The corresponding just intervals can all be generated from the octave, just perfect fifth and just major third.&lt;ref&gt;The just perfect fourth can be obtained by subtracting a just perfect fifth from an octave, the just minor third by subtracting a just major third from a just perfect fifth, the just major sixth by subtracting a just perfect fifth from the sum of an octave and a just major third, and the just minor sixth by subtracting a just major third from an octave.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|7 |12}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  {{sfrac|1|3}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For a tuning generated by an octave and a fifth=====
If a regular tuning generated by an octave  and a tempered perfect fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; octaves, the sizes of its perfect fourth, major and minor thirds, and major and minor  sixths, in octaves, are   {{math|1 − ''f'' }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|4 ''f'' − 2 }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 2 − 3 ''f'' }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 3 ''f'' − 1 }}&amp;nbsp;, and
{{math| 3 − 4 ''f'' }}, respectively.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} }}&amp;nbsp; (quarter-comma meantone), the octave, major thirds and minor sixths are perfectly just, but all other consonances are tempered.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|3}} }}&amp;nbsp;(one-third-comma meantone), the octave, minor thirds and major sixths are perfectly just, and all other consonances are tempered.  Otherwise, all consonances except the octave are tempered.&lt;ref&gt;Or will be so far out of tune as to be no longer consonant, if &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; is sufficiently close to one of its extreme limits, {{frac|4|7}} or {{frac|3|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the temperament mapping for the intervals of this temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f'' − 2)}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of schismic temperament=====
The just intervals of schismic temperament are its octave and perfect fourth and fifth, and its tempered intervals are its major and minor third and sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math|1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''  – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, and {{math| 1 + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of schismic temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament=====
The just intervals of Helmholtzian temperament are its octave, major third and minor sixth, and its tempered intervals are its perfect fourth and fifth, and its minor third and major sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|1 + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}},  {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} }}, and {{math| 1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} ) +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}&amp;nbsp;.

=====Images of the just consonances under the above temperament mappings=====
Let {{math| ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the temperament mappings for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, a regular tuning generated by an octave and a fifth, and schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments respectively, as described above.   The following table lists the images of each of the 5-limit just consonances under these temperament mappings.

===Commas, rank, and relations between consonances===
The purpose of tempering consonances is to allow a greater number of them to be accommodated within the confines of a fixed scale, at the expense of compromising their purity.  In a regular tuning, this manifests itself in the existence of intervals that can be formed from two ''different'' combinations of consonances, even though their corresponding just versions are independent.

====Examples====
In 12-tone equal temperament, an interval comprising 7 octaves can also be expressed as a combination of 12 perfect fifths.  In any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth (including 12-tone equal temperament), an interval comprising 4 perfect fifths can be expressed as a combination of 2 octaves plus a major third.  In both schismic and Helmholtzian temperament an interval comprising 5 octaves can be expressed as a combination of 8 perfect fifths plus a major third.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are the temperament mappings defined above, these relations can be written as:
{{centre|{{math|0 {{=}} 12 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 7 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}
That is, these relations correspond to the ditonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mapping of 12-tone equal temperament, the syntonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth, and the schisma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments.

====General case====
If some interval of a regular tuning can be formed from two different combinations of its consonances, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, whose corresponding just versions are independent,&lt;ref&gt;For this to be possible, at least one of the consonances &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; must be tempered.&lt;/ref&gt; there must exist positive whole numbers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, with &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for any {{math|''i''}}, such that

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Subtracting the right side of this equation from the left gives

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp;,}}

where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.   Such an equation is called a ''"[[Linear function|(linear) relation]]"''.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp; is the temperament mapping for the regular tuning, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; the just consonances such that   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;, the above linear relation can be written as

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 {{=}} ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') &lt;br&gt;
{{=}} ''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Thus, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, which is a non-zero ''p''-limit interval for some small prime ''p'', is mapped to zero by the temperament mapping &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If all the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,}}&amp;nbsp; and  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; are reasonably small in magnitude, then because each of the intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; is equal to, or closely approximated by, the corresponding &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; will be quite small.  It is referred to as a "''[[comma (music)|comma]]''".

The set of all ''p''-limit intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''}}&amp;nbsp; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; is called the "''comma lattice''" of the tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]], p.2).  These authors, however, use this term to refer not to the set of commas itself, but to the isomorphic lattice of ''t''-tuples, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ( ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' )}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; &lt;/ref&gt;   The comma lattice of the general regular tuning described above is itself another a regular tuning  whose rank is strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.  It follows from one of the fundamental theorems of [[linear algebra]]&lt;ref&gt;Namely, the [[rank–nullity theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; that the rank of the regular tuning and the rank of its comma lattice must sum to &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.

=====Examples=====
The regular tuning formed by the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament has rank 1.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic and ditonic commas, has rank 2.

A regular tuning generated by the octave and a tempered perfect fifth whose size in octaves is [[irrational number|irrational]] has rank 2.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic comma, has rank 1.

The regular tuning formed by the intervals of schismic temperament and that formed by the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament both have rank 2.  They both have the same comma lattice, generated by the schisma, of rank 1.

===Finding minimal sets of generators===
If a regular tuning has generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; that satisfy one or more linear relations, then its rank &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;, say, will be strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  Although there must then exist a set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning, it may not always be possible to select these from among the unmodified generators in the original set, &amp;nbsp;{{math| { ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; }}}&amp;nbsp;.  In general, some, at least, of the intervals in a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators will have to be constructed as combinations of 2 or more of the originals.&lt;ref&gt;The intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, for instance, are generated by its perfect fifth and an octave, but not by either of those two intervals by itself. The equal temperament semitone, which does generate all the intervals of this regular tuning, is a combination of 7 equal-temperament fifths less 4 octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave, just perfect fifth, and a tempered major third of size {{math| ''τ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|46|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) }} octaves.&lt;ref&gt;This major third, comprising 5{{frac|3|5}} just perfect fourths less 2 octaves, is approximately 2.7 cents sharper than just.&lt;/ref&gt;  A temperament mapping {{math| ''T''}}&amp;nbsp; for this tuning is defined by &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ({{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|18|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − {{frac|28|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.  The generators satisfy the relation &amp;nbsp;{{math| 0 {{=}} 18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 τ}}&amp;nbsp;, corresponding to the comma &amp;nbsp;{{math|  18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, a 5-limit interval of size approximately 13.7 cents.  Although this regular tuning has rank 2, none of its original generators can be expressed as a combination of the other two, so no pair of them can serve as generators for it. The fifth part, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{sfrac| 1 − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp;,  of a just perfect fourth, however, can be written as &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{=}} −7 + 11 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2 ''τ'' }}&amp;nbsp; (a combination of the original generators), and since &amp;nbsp;{{math| 1 {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1 − 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''τ'' {{=}} −2 + 28 ''φ'' {{=}} −2 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 18 ''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;, either the octave or the just perfect fifth together with the interval {{math| ''φ''}} constitute a pair of generators for this tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20]) describe a procedure for obtaining two intervals that will generate all the intervals of a regular tuning generated by three generators satisfying a single linear relation.  When applied to this example, that procedure produces the intervals {{math| {{frac|1|5}}}} (one fifth of an octave) and &amp;nbsp;{{math|{{frac|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp; (one fifth of a just perfect fifth).  While these intervals can indeed be combined together to produce any interval of the tuning, neither of them can be expressed as a combination of whole numbers of copies of the original generators. So, while the tuning generated by these two intervals does include all the intervals of the original, it is a [[Subset#⊂_and_⊃_symbols|''proper'' superset]] of this latter, and not identical to it. &lt;/ref&gt;

====General Case====
Finding a minimal set of generators for a regular tuning with consonances satisfying some linear relations requires, in general, some fairly advanced, but well-known, techniques of linear algebra.  Proofs are omitted from the following outline.&lt;ref&gt;Which is a slightly more detailed version of that given by Newman ([[#CITEREFNewma1997|1997]], pp.376–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; of a regular tuning satisfy the linear relations:
{{center|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{11} g_1 + a_{12} g_2 + \dots + a_{1t} g_t\\
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{21} g_1 + a_{22} g_2 + \dots + a_{2t} g_t\\
   &amp;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \dots \\
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{s1} g_1 + a_{s2} g_2 + \dots + a_{st} g_t 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;,}}

and no others apart from linear combinations of these, then the rank, {{math|''c''}}, say, of the tuning's comma lattice is the rank of the {{math|''s'' × ''t''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; whose entries are the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and the rank of the tuning itself is &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;If the relations are independent, then &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; will be of [[full rank]], and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c'' {{=}} ''s'' &lt; ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If desired, the elimination of redundant relations can reduce the problem to this case.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S''}}&amp;nbsp; be the [[Smith normal form]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; be &amp;nbsp;{{math|''s'' × ''s''}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; [[unimodular matrix|unimodular matrices]]&lt;ref&gt;A matrix is unimodular when it is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] and both its own entries and those of its inverse are integers.  The Smith normal form and unimodular matrices &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; relating it to the original matix always exist for matrices having integer entries.  The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} will be unique if the original matrix has full rank, but not otherwise. The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} will not be unique.&lt;/ref&gt; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S'' {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''A U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| (''t'' − ''c'') × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; rows, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' × (''t'' − ''c'')}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; columns,  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × 1}}&amp;nbsp; column vector whose entries are &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and let &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w'' {{=}} ''W g''}}&amp;nbsp;.

Since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; are integers, the entries, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w''}}&amp;nbsp; are intervals in the tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  But since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; are also integers, and  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g'' {{=}} ''V w''}}&amp;nbsp;, it follows that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; constitute a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning.

The inverses of these unimodular matrices are:

From this it follows that the tuning has rank 2, and its comma lattice rank 3.  The last two rows of the inverse of &amp;nbsp;{{tmath|U}}&amp;nbsp;,

{{center|{{tmath| U^{-1} {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
                                                    1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
                                                    1 &amp; -2 &amp;  -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
                                                    1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                           1 &amp; -1 &amp;  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;,}}
                                           
give the octave, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, and the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{frac|1|19}} + {{frac|2|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  {{frac|1|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp;octaves as a minimal set of two generators for the tuning.  This last interval is called a "secor", after [[George Secor]], who discovered it, and the regular tuning just described is called "miracle temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Secor ([[#CITEREFSecor1975|1975]], [[#CITEREFSecor1976|1976]], [[#CITEREFSecor2006|2006]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The tuning's tempered fifth comprises 6 secors, and its tempered major third one octave minus 7 secors.   Its minor sixth is thus tempered to 7 secors.

The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent [[research institute]] at the [[University of Utah]] that focuses on the development of new [[scientific computing]] and [[scientific visualization|visualization]] techniques, tools, and systems with primary applications to [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute – Home|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipson|first1=Hod|last2=Kurman|first2=Melba|title=Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-1118350638|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCI Institute is noted worldwide in the [[visualization (graphics)|visualization]] community for contributions by faculty, alumni, and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|title=The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-875883-9|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty are associated primarily with the [[University of Utah School of Computing|School of Computing]], Department of Bioengineering, Department of Mathematics, and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with auxiliary faculty in the [[University of Utah Medical School|Medical School]] and [[University of Utah College of Architecture and Planning|School of Architecture]].

==History==
The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute started in 1992 as a research group in the [[University of Utah School of Computing]] by [[Christopher R. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and Rob MacLeod. In 1994 this group became the Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, and in 2000 the name was changed to the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. In 2007, the SCI Institute was awarded funding from [[USTAR]] to recruit more faculty in medical imaging technology. The SCI Institute was recognized as an [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]] [[CUDA]] Center of Excellence in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humber|first1=Andrew|title=NVIDIA Recognizes University Of Utah As A Cuda Center Of Excellence|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1217508281856.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en-us|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[USTAR]] funding allowed faculty recruitment for genomic [[signal processing]] and information visualization. in 2014, [[Intel]] partnered with the SCI Institute to form the Intel Parallel Computing Center for Scientific Rendering to research and develop large scale and in situ visualization techniques for Intel hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel® Parallel Computing Center at SCI Institute, University of Utah {{!}} Intel® Software|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-computing-center-at-sci-institute-university-of-utah|website=Intel Developer Zone|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The overarching research objective of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is to conduct [[applied science|application-driven research]] in the creation of new [[scientific computing]] techniques, tools, and systems. Given the proximity and availability of research conducted at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]], a main application focus is [[medicine]]. SCI Institute researchers also apply computational techniques to scientific and engineering sub-specialties, such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[biomechanics]], [[electrophysiology]], bioelectric fields, [[scientific visualization]], [[parallel computing]], [[inverse problems]], and [[neuroimaging]].

[[Image:Kronobageriet Stockholm Sibylle Riddar 20060524.jpg|thumb|Stockholm Music Museum]]
'''The Stockholm Music Museum''' was founded in 1899 (then named ”Musikhistoriska museet”), inspired by an exhibition of theatre and music which was part of the great [[Stockholm]] art and industry exhibition of 1897. Via donations and appeals for gifts around 200 [[musical instrument]]s and an amount of archive material concerning the history of music and theatre were gathered. The new museum was opened to the general public in 1901. In 1932 the museum, in the form of a trust, was associated with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] and received a state grant. The state became increasingly responsible for the museum, which in 1981 became part of a new public body–The Swedish National Collections of Music. At the same time the museum was renamed The Stockholm Music Museum (Musikmuseet), since its activities had broadened and changed in character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikmuseet.se/ommuseet/index.php?l=en&amp;mmcss=&amp;oid=2&amp;niv=2&amp;ommu_open=1 Musikmuseet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The present collection encompasses approximately 5,500 instruments with an emphasis on [[Western art music]], and [[Nordic folk music|Scandinavian folk music]] instruments. 

Since 1979 the Stockholm Music Museum is located in the splendid former Crown Bakery, in the same quarter as the Court Stables, beside the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], in central Stockholm. The Crown Bakery dates from the 17th century, and is Stockholm’s oldest industrial building.

[[Image:Konsertsal, Musik- och teatermuseet, Stockholm.JPG|thumb|upright|Concert Hall]]
This building has a long and eventful history and has through the centuries performed a number of functions: bakery, weapon depot, spirits store. Yet almost all the time—from the 1640s to 1958—it has been a bakery for the armed forces in Stockholm. It even boasted mobile ovens which could be used during field exercises. In 1945 the building was ravaged by a fire which destroyed its upper floors in the northern part–where the Concert Hall is now located.

A large portion of the museum's instrument collection is viewable on the museum's webpage, and will from 2010 onwards, be available through the EU's europeana culture webportal: www.europeana.eu

==History==
The Chicago School of Professional Psychology was established by practicing psychologists with the goal of providing high-quality professional psychology training in a not-for-profit setting. Initial plans for the school were made in 1977 and realized in January 1979 by the nonprofit Midwestern Psychology Development Foundation. The Chicago School of Professional Psychology began its first classes at temporary quarters located at 30 West Chicago Avenue before moving to the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]] on Michigan Avenue in 1980. In 1986 The Chicago School moved to its next location, the historic [[Dearborn Station]] in Chicago’s South Loop. In 2004, the school found a new downtown home at 325 N. Wells Street. From its early days the school began to earn a reputation for being a leader in diversity and multicultural training.{{citation needed | date = January 2016}} Classes such as Cultural Issues in Assessment and Intercultural Psychotherapy Laboratory began to appear in the school’s bulletin in the 1980s.{{citation needed | date = August 2018}} In 1988, the school opened its first institute for diversity-related training, research, and events: the Center for Inter-Cultural Clinical Psychology. One of its original initiatives was a Cultural Impact Conference, which remains an annual fixture on campus. The center eventually evolved in 2005 to become the Center for Multicultural and Diversity Studies. The Chicago School’s innovative approach to diversity received recognition in 1998 with an Institutional Diversity Award bestowed by the [[National Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology]] (NCSPP). NCSPP would again honor the school in 2005 with its Advocacy Award “in recognition of its outstanding commitment to advancing the attitude, skills, and knowledge of professional advocacy and public policy.”{{citation needed | date = January 2016}}

The school expanded to the west coast with three campuses in Southern California. The first out-of-state location was opened in downtown Los Angeles in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref name="newcampus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2008/03/31/news/news_briefs/at02.txt | title = Psychology Campus Coming Downtown | work= Los Angeles Downtown News | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school announced a formal affiliation with the [[California Graduate Institute]] and its campuses in Westwood and Irvine in the fall of 2008.&lt;ref name="TCS-CGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechicagoschool.edu/content.cfm/detailed_news?NewsID=502940|title=The Chicago School Unites with CGI, Expands Number of Southern Cal Campuses|publisher=The Chicago School of Professional Psychology|accessdate=2008-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213090437/http://thechicagoschool.edu/content.cfm/detailed_news?NewsID=502940|archivedate=2009-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having developed from the psychoanalytically oriented clinical training at CGI, the Westwood campus maintained the psychoanalytic training model of its predecessor until it closed in the summer of 2014. CGI has now formally been incorporated into the Applied Clinical Psychology doctoral (PsyD) program where graduates obtain a specialization in psychoanalytic psychotherapy under the guidance of faculty from local psychoanalytic institutes and training clinics.&lt;ref name="TCSPP-ACP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/los-angeles/programs/psyd-applied-clinical-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
'''East Coast'''

* '''Washington, D.C., Campus''': The Chicago School's east coast campus in Washington, D.C., opened in summer 2010 three blocks from the White House at McPherson Square.

'''South'''
* '''New Orleans, Campus''' The Chicago School at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans is located on the campus of Xavier University, a historically black university in Louisiana.

'''Midwest'''

* '''Chicago Campus''': [[File:Chicago-school-building.JPG|thumb|Downtown Chicago location]] The Chicago School’s downtown campus is located at 325 North Wells St. Chicago, IL 60654 - in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. The building itself opened in 1914 as a Chase and Sanborn Coffee warehouse and is one of the few remaining relics on the Chicago River of the city’s industrial era. The school expanded in early 2007 with new space opening across the street in the Merchandise Mart.

'''West Coast'''

* '''Irvine Campus''':In addition to Los Angeles campus, The Chicago School's affiliation with CGI&lt;ref name="TCS-CGI"/&gt; also incorporates a campus in Irvine, California. The California Graduate Institute of The Chicago School, at Irvine, is located next to UC Irvine.
* '''Los Angeles Campus''': Located at 617 W. 7th St., the L.A. Campus site is located four blocks north of the [[Staples Center]], near Pasadena, Santa Ana, and Santa Monica freeways, and one block from the 7th Street Metro Center. 
** '''Los Angeles Campus Lawsuit''':  The lawsuit, which was filed by students enrolled in the inaugural 2008 clinical psychology doctoral cohort at the Los Angeles campus, alleged that students were misled and deceived by the school into attending a doctoral program that was not accredited by the American Psychological Association. Students claim that they were offered admission to the Los Angeles campus after applying to the APA accredited Chicago campus doctoral program, while the school knowingly "downplayed" the fact that the Los Angeles campus had no clear path towards accreditation at the time that admission was offered. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-chicago-school-of-psychology-accreditation-20140723-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students subsequently filed a class-action lawsuit in 2014. In September 2016, the court found that students were not properly apprised as to the accreditation differences between the Chicago and the Los Angeles campus programs. The Chicago School settled the lawsuit for 11.2 million dollars. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bigclassaction.com/settlement/students-win-11-2m-settlement-in-chicago-school-of.php&lt;/ref&gt;The Los Angeles campus Clinical Psychology PsyD program obtained APA accreditation in 2018.

'''The Initiative for Science, Society and Policy''' ('''ISSP''') is a [[research center]] sponsored by the [[University of Southern Denmark]] and [[Roskilde University]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/c_issp.aspx|title=The Initiative for Science, Society and Policy - Syddansk Universitet|website=www.sdu.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISSP aims to help make science and technology integral components of [[societal]] [[planning]] and [[public discourse]] and to be a leading platform for highlighting, expanding and rethinking the meaning of scientific social responsibility in universities across Denmark and abroad.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

The vision for ISSP is to enable society to benefit more fully from the scientific expertise at its universities while ISSP supports researchers to reflect more on their scientific responsibilities and participate in civic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/mission-vision/|title=ISSP mission &amp; vission|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center was founded by [[Steen Rasmussen]] in 2009 at the University of Southern Denmark. In 2013 it became a cross-university center when Roskilde University joined the ISSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/history/|title=History - Initiative for Science, Society and Policy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research groups==
ISSP research groups serve as open and independent platforms for addressing critical contemporary issues that require productive interactions among science, society and policy.{{fact|date=October 2016}} The center currently (2016) has four specific research areas and therefor four research groups: Behavioral Science and Public Policy (BSPP), Living and Intelligent Technology (LIT), Social Software (SoS) and Social Aspects in New Technologies (SAiNT).{{fact|date=October 2016}}

===Behavioural Science and Public Policy (BSPP)===
The Behavioural Science and Public Policy group is led by Pelle Guldborg Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pelleonline.org/index.html|title=Home|website=pelleonline.org|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural Scientist from [[Roskilde University]], Denmark, who is also the Director of ISSP. The group focuses its attention on applied behavioural science and the responsible use of behavioral science in the making of public policies, with emphasis on securing scientific- and evidence-based policies.

Among many achievements from BSPP the Danish Nudging Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danishnudgingnetwork.dk|title=Danish Nudging Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The European Nudging Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tenudge.eu|title=The European Nudging Network - The European Nudging Network|website=The European Nudging Network|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://albertoalemanno.eu/articles/nudgehype/|title=Nudge: hype or genuine revolution in policymaking? - Blog Alberto Alemanno|date=2014-09-06|website=Blog Alberto Alemanno|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esof2014.org/programme-1/other-esof2014-activities/the-european-nudge-network|title=The European Nudge Network — ESOF|website=esof2014.org|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the most prominent.

===Living and Intelligent Technology (LIT)===
The Living and Intelligent Technology (LIT) group is led by [[Steen Rasmussen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flint.sdu.dk/index.php?page=steen-rasmussen|title=FLinT - Steen Rasmussen|website=flint.sdu.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of physics at the [[University of Southern Denmark]], who is also the founder of ISSP. The group aims to take stock of the state of the art in living and intelligent technology and recommend priorities for the socially responsible scientific pursuit of living and intelligent technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/living-technologies/|title=Living and Intelligent Technology, ISSP|last=|first=|date=|website=issp.center|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIT is the main creator and enforcer of the BINC mission.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

===Social Software (SoS)===
The Social Software group is led by Vincent F. Hendricks, professor of formal philosophy at the University of Copenhagen. The aim of the group is to give input to the broader public and decision makers about how the informational society and the technologies that it celebrates are prone to irrational information-phenomena (Infostorms) that may systematically bias and misdirect democratic information and decision processes, and how these problems may be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/social-software/|title=Social Software|last=|first=|date=|website=issp.center|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISSPs Social Software group is intertwined with/cooperating with the Center for Information and Bubble Studies (CIBS)[http://bubblestudies.ku.dk] at the University of Copenhagen, and the Humanomics Research Center [http://www.mapping-humanities.dk] at Aalborg University.

===Social Aspects in New Technology (SAiNT)===

==Missions==

===BINC (Bio-, Info,- Nano- &amp; Cognitive Technology)===
The discussion of a fourth industrial revolution is becoming increasingly more prominent in the public discourse.{{fact|date=October 2016}} ISSP argues that the vast technological development of the ecology of the so-called BINC technologies (bio-, info-, nano-, and cognitive technologies) push us towards a global gear-change. ISSP has four theses of what this gear-change means, that has been published in the Danish book “Hvad burde politik handle om?” in 2015, and published separately on the Danish, online news media Videnskab.dk – one of ISSPs partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/teknologiudviklingen-traekker-os-mod-et-globalt-gearskifte|title=Teknologiudviklingen trækker os mod et globalt gearskifte|website=videnskab.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/collaborator/partner/90|title=View Partner {{!}} Videnskab.dk|website=videnskab.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four theses are:

# The digital economy is fundamentally different from the industrial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/den-digitale-okonomi-er-fundamentalt-anderledes-end-den-industrielle|title=Den digitale økonomi er fundamentalt anderledes end den industrielle|last=|first=|date=|website=Videnskab.dk|publisher=Steen Rasmussen &amp; Lene Andersen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The middleclass and the democracy is under pressure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/et-teknologidrevet-globalt-gearskift-middelklassen-og-demokratiet-er-under-pres|title=Et teknologidrevet globalt gearskift: Middelklassen og demokratiet er under pres|website=videnskab.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# No national state can take care of its citizens by itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/ingen-nationalstat-kan-tage-hand-om-sine-borgere-alene|title=Ingen nationalstat kan tage hånd om sine borgere alene|website=videnskab.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A technological gear-change demands new, global narratives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/et-teknologisk-globalt-gearskifte-kraever-nye-globale-fortaellinger|title=Et teknologisk globalt gearskifte kræver nye, globale fortællinger|website=videnskab.dk|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BINC mission evolves around the sharing and spreading of knowledge and understanding of BINC technologies, the BINC human, the BINC economy, the BINC society and BINC narratives. The BINC mission aims to progress through the establishment of networks and research consortia.

ISSP has a thorough Manifesto that explains the BINC mission – known as the BINC Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/bincmanifesto/|title=The BINC Manifesto|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math)===
The aim of the STEM mission is to increase the intake of Natural Science and Technology students in higher education. The mission is motivated by the increasing scarcity of people with Natural Science Masters and engineers in Denmark – if an intervention isn’t instantiated. The engineer union IDA predicts a shortage of over 13,500 masters by 2025 in Denmark. To solve this problem, it is necessary to map the different choices the future student makes on the road to his or her final education choice. There is a need to determine how the course from kindergarten to the Natural Science university faculty looks like, to be able to identify the situations in which an intervention will have the greatest effect. In the STEM mission, we will identify the especially relevant points in the choice process which will be the focus of following efforts towards getting more people to choose a STEM education track – we do this through psychological insights in human behaviour and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/stem/|title=STEM - Initiative for Science, Society and Policy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEN (The European Nudging Network)===
The aim of the TEN mission (The European Nudging Network) is to gather the most essential stakeholders in Europe to establish an open-access database of nudges in the world. TEN is going to secure the outreach of the scientific knowledge about nudging, and give policymakers and other stakeholders good grounds to be able to use nudging successfully in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.issp.center/ten/|title=TEN - Initiative for Science, Society and Policy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written and published free financial literacy tools available on his blog and website.

== Activism ==

Steuer is known as a spokesperson and leader in the financial literacy movement. In 2016, Steuer’s son (age 11) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Faced with a chronic illness that requires constant maintenance, Steuer realized his own son could be denied insurance coverage under the health care plan proposed by President Donald Trump. This led him to author the petition Fair Health Insurance For All, described as a petition to the U.S. Senate to seek a “solution” to health insurance costs. And that “any solution should simplify and seek to reduce costs while maintaining and increasing benefits.”

Steuer also authored The Insurance Bill of Rights, which is designed to empower consumers, and provides a Best Practices Roadmap for members of the insurance industry.

== Early life and education ==

Steuer was born on March 8, 1964, in [[San Francisco]], California.  He was raised in San Francisco and later moved to Marin County where attended Redwood High School.  He attended [[California State University Chico]] where he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business (Finance) and was an intern for a free legal information service on campus, C.L.I.C. (Community Legal Information Center).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aschico.com/CLIC] Community Legal Information Center&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) Designation in the late 1980s and the Certified Personal and Family Finance Educator (CPFFE) from the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences in 2012. Steuer is one of 40 licensed Life and Disability Insurance agents from the California Department of Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0200-industry/0050-renew-license/0200-requirements/life-disability.cfm]''California Department of Insurance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Total least squares.svg|right|thumb|200px| The bivariate (Deming regression) case of total least squares. The red lines show the error in both ''x'' and ''y''. This is different from the traditional least squares method which measures error parallel to the ''y'' axis. The case shown, with deviations measured perpendicularly, arises when ''x'' and ''y'' have equal variances.]]

In [[applied statistics]], '''total least squares''' is a type of [[errors-in-variables regression]], a [[least squares]] data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of [[Deming regression]] and also of [[orthogonal regression]], and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.

The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the [[Frobenius norm]], [[low-rank approximation]] of the data matrix.&lt;ref&gt;I.

== Linear model ==

===Background===

In the [[least squares]] method of data modeling, the [[objective function]], ''S'',
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r^TWr},&lt;/math&gt;
is minimized, where ''r'' is the vector of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] and ''W'' is a weighting matrix. In [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r=y-X\boldsymbol\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are ''m'' observations in '''y''' and ''n'' parameters in '''β''' with ''m''&gt;''n''. '''X''' is a ''m''×''n'' matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, '''x'''. The weight matrix '''W''' is, ideally, the inverse of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; of the observations '''y'''. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An alternative form is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T W \boldsymbol\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter shift from some starting estimate of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between '''y''' and the value calculated using the starting value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\beta=X^T Wy}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Allowing observation errors in all variables===

Now, suppose that both '''x''' and '''y''' are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r_x^TM_x^{-1}r_x+r_y^TM_y^{-1}r_y},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_y&lt;/math&gt; are the residuals in '''x''' and '''y''' respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f(r_x,r_y,\boldsymbol\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;, the constraints are expressed by ''m'' [[condition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Deming, Statistical Adjustment of Data, Wiley, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F=\Delta y -\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x} r_x-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y} r_y -X\Delta\boldsymbol\beta=0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the ''m'' constraints. It is solved by the use of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. After some algebraic manipulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gans |first=Peter |title=Data Fitting in the Chemical Sciences |year=1992 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9780471934127 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471934127.html |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result is obtained.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} \Delta y}, &lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} y},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''M''' is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M=K_xM_xK_x^T+K_yM_yK_y^T;\ K_x=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x},\ K_y=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices '''M''' and '''W''' are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_i,\beta)=\alpha + \beta x_i&lt;/math&gt;
in this case
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\beta^2 \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;
showing how the variance at the ''i''th point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the line.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2_i \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;

An expression of this type is used in fitting [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Parameter errors and correlation|pH titration data]] where a small error on ''x'' translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.

=== Algebraic point of view ===
First of all it is necessary to note that the TLS problem does not have a solution in general, which was already shown in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Golub and C. F. Van Loan, An analysis of the total least squares problem. Numer. Anal., 17, 1980, pp. 883–893.&lt;/ref&gt; The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.

The computation of the TLS using [[singular value decomposition]] is described in standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}} pp 596.&lt;/ref&gt; We can solve the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;XB \approx Y&lt;/math&gt;
for ''B'' where ''X'' is ''m''-by-''n'' and ''Y'' is ''m''-by-''k''. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;The notation ''XB''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is used here to reflect the notation used in the earlier part of the article.  In the computational literature the problem has been more commonly presented as ''AX''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''B'', i.e. with the letter ''X'' used for the ''n''-by-''k'' matrix of unknown regression coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, we seek to find ''B'' that minimizes error matrices ''E'' and ''F'' for ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{argmin}_{E,F} \| [E\; F] \|_F, \qquad (X+E) B = Y+F&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[augmented matrix]] with ''E'' and ''F'' side by side and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frobenius norm]], the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.

This can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\times k&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.
The goal is then to find &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; that reduces the rank of &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt; by ''k''. Define &lt;math&gt;[U] [\Sigma] [V]^*&lt;/math&gt; to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;[X\; Y] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^* =  [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} V_{XX}^* &amp; V_{YX}^* \\ V_{XY}^* &amp; V_{YY}^*\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of ''X'' and ''Y''.

Using the [[Eckart–Young theorem]], the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged, while the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-smallest singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E)\; (Y+F)] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0_{k\times k}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*&lt;/math&gt;
so by linearity,
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -[U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}0_{n\times n} &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*. &lt;/math&gt;
We can then remove blocks from the ''U'' and Σ matrices, simplifying to
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -U_Y\Sigma_Y \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*= -[X\; Y] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*.&lt;/math&gt;
This provides ''E'' and ''F'' so that 
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;-V_{YY}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving&lt;ref&gt;Bjõrck, Ake (1996) ''Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems'', Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. {{ISBN|978-0898713602}} {{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} -V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1} \\ -V_{YY} V_{YY}^{-1}\end{bmatrix} = [(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} =  0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;B=-V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A naive [[GNU Octave]] implementation of this is:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function B = tls(X,Y)

[m n]   = size(X);            % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
Z       = [X Y];              % Z is X augmented with Y.
[U S V] = svd(Z,0);           % find the SVD of Z.
VXY     = V(1:n,1+n:end);     % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
VYY     = V(1+n:end,1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
B       = -VXY/VYY;

end
&lt;/source&gt;

The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called ''classical TLS algorithm''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]] and J. Vandewalle (1991) ''The Total Least Squares Problems: Computational Aspects and Analysis''. SIAM Publications, Philadelphia PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computation ===

The standard implementation of classical TLS algorithm is available through [http://www.netlib.org/vanhuffel/index.html Netlib], see also.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], Documented Fortran 77 programs of the extended classical total least squares algorithm, the partial singular value decomposition algorithm and the partial total least squares algorithm, Internal Report ESAT-KUL 88/1, ESAT Lab., Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The extended classical total least squares algorithm, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 25, pp. 111–119, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the literature), as introduced by [[Sabine Van Huffel|Van Huffel]] and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is, however, ''not the TLS solution'' in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. Plešinger, The Total Least Squares Problem and Reduction of Data in AX ≈ B.

Strakoš, and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The total least squares problem in AX ≈ B. A new classification with the relationship to the classical works. SIMAX vol. 32 issue 3 (2011), pp. 748–770.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-linear model ==
For [[non-linear least squares|non-linear systems]] similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J^TM^{-1}J\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=J^T M^{-1} \Delta y}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Geometrical interpretation ==
{{main|Curve fitting#Algebraic fit versus geometric fit for curves}}
{{further|Orthogonal regression}}
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the "vertical" distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the [[distance from a point to a line|shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve]], that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called ''two dimensional Euclidean regression'' (Stein, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stein |first=Yaakov J. |title=Two Dimensional Euclidean Regression |url =http://www.dspcsp.com/pubs/euclreg.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''orthogonal regression''.

== Scale invariant methods ==
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the line, as in the diagram – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, which is  meaningless. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different line). To avoid these problems it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the [[Mahalanobis distance]] from the points to the line, providing a [[maximum-likelihood]] solution;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} the unknown precisions could be found via [[analysis of variance]].

In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance&amp;mdash;i.e. it is not [[scale invariance|scale invariant]]. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate [[Paul Samuelson]] proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line, (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1942 |title=A Note on Alternative Regressions |journal=Econometrica |publisher=The Econometric Society |doi=10.2307/1907024 |jstor=1907024 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as '''standardised major axis''' (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ricker |first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">The '''unit of analysis''' is the major [[entity]] that is being [[wikt:Analysis|analyzed]] in a [[Experiment|study]]. It is the 'what' or 'who' that is being studied. In [[social science]] [[research]], typical units of analysis include individuals (most common), [[group (sociology)|groups]], [[social organization]]s and [[social artifact]]s.

The literature of [[international relations]] provides a good example of units of analysis. In "Man, the State and War", [[Kenneth N. Waltz]] creates a tripartite analysis with three different units of analysis: the man (individual), the state (a group), and the international system (the system in which groups interact).

This is not to be confused with the [[unit of observation]], which is the unit described by one's data (neighborhoods using the [[U.S. Census]], individuals using surveys, etc.). For example, a study may have a unit of observation at the individual level but may have the unit of analysis at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21586">A '''wildland–urban interface''' (or WUI) is a zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of the zone may also be included.  These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by [[wildland]]s are at risk of [[wildfire]]s.

==Definitions==
[[File:Wildland Urban Interface Catalonia.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the wildland-urban interface in Catalonia featuring intermix and interface zones.]]
The [[US Forest Service]] defines the wildland-urban interface as the place where "homes and wildlands meet or intermingle", or more specifically, where "humans and their development meet or intermix with wildland fuel".&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Susan M.|last2=Comas|first2=Sara J.|last3=Menakis|first3=James P.|last4=Steward|first4=Susan I.|last5=Cleveland|first5=Helene|last6=Bramwell|first6=Lincoln|last7=Radeloff|first7=Volker|title=Wildfire, Wildlands, and People: Understanding and Preparing for Wildfire in the Wildland-Urban Interface|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/fote/reports/GTR-299.pdf|website=USDA Forest Service|publisher=USDA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more quantitative definition is provided by the [[Federal Register]], which defines WUI areas as those containing at least one housing unit per 40 acres. Federal Register definitions can be combined with quantitative criteria to classify the WUI into two categories:

* Intermix WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres in which vegetation occupies at least 50% of terrestrial area, and
* Interface WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres, contain less than 50% vegetation, and lie within 2.4 km of a heavily vegetated area.
** A "heavily vegetated area" is defined as an area containing over 75% wildlife vegetation and occupies at least 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of terrestrial area.

The main difference between these types of WUI are that homes in intermix WUI are interspersed with vegetation, whereas homes in interface WUI are adjacent to heavy vegetation.&lt;ref name="Radeloff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeloff|first1=V. C.|last2=Hammer|first2=R. B.|last3=Stewart|first3=S. I.|last4=Fried|first4=J. S.|last5=Holcomb|first5=S. S.|last6=McKeefry|first6=J.

==WUI growth and causes==

From 1990 to 2000, WUI area in the United States increased by 18 percent, covering 6 million additional homes. As of 2013, it was reported that the number of wildfires in the United States exceeding 50,000 acres had been steadily increasing since 1983, with the bulk of the change occurring from 2003 to 2013. The intensity of these fires was found to be increasing as well, contributing to an observed increase in costs related to reducing fire risks, fighting wildfires, and protecting property.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WUI growth has also been noted in other places throughout the world, including Argentina, France, South Africa, Australia, and Mediterranean regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SYPHARD|first=ALEXANDRA D.|last2=RADELOFF|first2=VOLKER C.|last3=HAWBAKER|first3=TODD J.|last4=STEWART|first4=SUSAN I.|date=January 16, 2009|title=Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=758–769|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|issn=0888-8892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radeloff|first=Volker C.|last2=Helmers|first2=David P.|last3=Kramer|first3=H.

===Population shifts===
Factors behind WUI growth include population growth, housing growth in wildland areas, population shifts, and the expansion of cities into wildlands. In the United States, WUI growth is partially attributed to population shifts towards the West and South. Additionally, as of 2013, the migration of retiring [[baby-boomers]] to smaller communities closer to scenic natural resources (“amenity migration”) is expected to contribute to WUI growth as well.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, the WUI was the fastest-growing land use type in the United States, and 97% of new WUI areas were the result of new housing rather than increases in wildlife vegetation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Ecological factors===

Keane, et al. attribute the increase in WUI area to ecological factors such as climate change, insect pests, and diseases, which have resulted in more arid and flammable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Keane Eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Agee|first2=James K.|last3=Fulé|first3=Peter|last4=Keeley|first4=Jon E.|last5=Key|first5=Carl|last6=Kitchen|first6=Stanley G.|last7=Miller|first7=Richard|last8=Schulte|first8=Lisa A.|title=Ecological effects of large fires on US landscapes: benefit or catastrophe?|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|date=2008|volume=17|pages=696-712|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/eoarc/sites/default/files/publication/617.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can result in significant shifts in wildlife composition due to changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Parsons|first3=Russell A.|last4=Gray|first4=Kathy|date=2008|title=Climate change effects on historical range and variability of two large landscapes in western Montana, USA|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_keane_r001.pdf|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=254|pages=375-389|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population shifts can result in unintended ecological consequences resulting in higher landscape flammability. For example, flammable materials present in housing serve as a direct means of wildfire spread, while landscaping can cause non-native species to spread.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To a small degree, vegetation growth into or near settled areas can lead to WUI growth. Between 1990 and 2010, vegetation growth accounted for 3% of all WUI growth in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on environment ===
Environmental issues related to WUI growth extend beyond the increased risk of wildfire damage to human settlements. For example, housing growth in WUI regions can displace and fragment native vegetation. Additionally, the introduction of non-native species by humans through landscaping can change the wildlife composition of interface regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other factors can also have impacts on the environment, including pets which can kill large quantities of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loss|first=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2013-01-29|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest fragmentation is another impact of WUI growth, which can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, increased forest fragmentation can lead to an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=John S.|last2=Skelly|first2=David K.|last3=Holford|first3=Theodore R.|last4=Fish|first4=Durland|date=2005-09-27|title=Forest fragmentation predicts local scale heterogeneity of Lyme disease risk|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=146|issue=3|pages=469–475|doi=10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for this effect is the production of high-density isolated populations of transmission vectors such as ticks and mice. Isolated forest patches in fragmented environments tend to be surrounded by unfavorable habitats, which hinders the dispersal of infected species and increases their local density. Additionally, disease vectors in isolated patches can undergo genetic differentiation, increasing their survivability as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Julie A.|last2=Marrotte|first2=Robby R.|last3=Desrosiers|first3=Nathalie|last4=Fiset|first4=Jessica|last5=Gaitan|first5=Jorge|last6=Gonzalez|first6=Andrew|last7=Koffi|first7=Jules K.|last8=Lapointe|first8=Francois-Joseph|last9=Leighton|first9=Patrick A.|date=2014-05-07|title=Climate change and habitat fragmentation drive the occurrence ofBorrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, at the northeastern limit of its distribution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/eva.12165|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=750–764|doi=10.1111/eva.12165|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4227856|pmid=25469157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in wildfire risk pose a threat to conservation in WUI growth regions. Between 1985-94 and 2005-14, the area burned by wildfires in the United States nearly doubled from 18,000 to 33,000 square kilometers, and this increase can partly be attributed to WUI growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In North America, Chile, and Australia, unnaturally high fire frequencies have resulted in incidences of exotic annual grasses replacing native shrublands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Wildfire Risk Assessment==

As of 2013, 32 percent of homes, apartments, and other human dwellings in the United States are contained within the WUI, and this figure is expected to grow over time. Wildfires can pose a risk to any area containing vegetation, as embers transported by wind can ignite fires a mile or more away from a flame front.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt; The increase in wildfire prevalence in the United States between 1985-94 and 2005-14 resulted in a tripling of federal wildfire suppression expenditures from $0.4 billion per year to $1.4 billion per year, indicating that wildfires pose a potent economic risk to communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Identification of high-risk areas===
Geospatial quantification of wildfire risk can highlight key areas for policy and emergency response planning. Several factors are used to assess the threat wildfires pose to human settlements. These factors can mainly be divided into ecological factors (e.g. climate, seasonal weather patterns, and vegetation) and human factors (e.g. arrangement and density of housing). Quantitative risk assessments can be produced by combining data such as the probability of large wildfires, estimated wildfire intensity, population density, and the proximity of human settlements to roads. One approach, used by Haas et al., combines geographical data on population density and probability of exposure to a large wildfire to produce maps that highlight spatial variability in wildfire risk. The highest-risk areas identified by this method are those where moderate population levels overlap with or are adjacent to wildlands with high chances of wildfire exposure.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Jessica R.|last2=Calkin|first2=David E.|last3=Thompson|first3=Matthew P.|date=2013|title=A national approach for integrating wildfire simulation modeling into Wildland Urban Interface risk assessments within the United States|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2013_haas_j001.pdf|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=119|pages=44-53|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.06.011|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect of population density on wildfire risk ====
Population density correlates with wildfire risk for two main reasons. First, people can cause fires; from 2001 to 2011, 85% of wildfires recorded by National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) were caused by people. Second, housing can intensify wildfires because they can potentially contain highly flammable material such wood shakes, and can be a source for mobile embers which can cause wildfires to spread.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt;

The relationship between population density and wildfire risk is non-linear. At low population densities, human ignitions are low, and ignitions increase with population density. However, in a range of environments sampled from North America, the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and South Africa, a threshold of population density was observed at which fire occurrence decreased. Possible reasons for this decrease include decreases in open space for ember transmission, fuel fragmentation due to urban development, and higher availability of fire-suppression resources. For this reason, areas with moderate population densities tend to exhibit higher wildfire risk than areas with low or high population densities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Wildfire simulation modeling===
Some factors typically used in wildfire simulations include historical spatial wildfire data, geographic features, geographical distributions of vegetation, and climate.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate" /&gt; One algorithm commonly used to simulate wildfire spread are Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithms.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to MTT algorithms, fire boundaries were primarily modeled through the application of [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens' principle]] by treating boundaries as wave fronts on a two-dimensional surface. MTT algorithms are capable of calculating fire perimeters in a nearly-equivalent way finding the minimum time it takes for a fire to travel between two points, and are advantageous due to their speed and scalability. However, MTT methods come at the cost of assuming nearly-constant environmental conditions such as wind direction and fuel moisture dynamics, and thus tend to be more apt for short-timescale simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finney|first=Mark A|date=August 2002|title=Fire growth using minimum travel time methods|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/x02-068|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1420–1424|doi=10.1139/x02-068|issn=0045-5067|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk Management==
The vulnerability of a community to wildfires is partly determined by its decisions regarding land use, building standards, and landscaping choices. Community-focused risk management efforts often focused on reducing the flammability of dwellings and wildland vegetation in and around high-risk areas.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of responsibilities ===
[[File:Fire Adapted Communities infographic.jpg|thumb|287x287px|By distributing wildfire management responsibilities, communities can mitigate risks.]]
Calkin, et al. present a conceptual framework for risk mitigation in the WUI. In this model, two major objectives that lead to decreased home loss are (a) reducing the probability of home exposure to wildfires and (b) reducing the susceptibility of houses to wildfire loss. The former can be split into three actionable objectives: reducing wildfire occurrence, reducing wildfire size and intensity, and reducing human development in fire-prone areas. The latter can be converted into a single actionable objective, i.e. increasing home resistance to ignition. In the framework, responsibility for actions is attributed to three major groups: land management agencies, local governments, and homeowners. Land management agencies can help reduce wildfire occurrence through ignition prevention, and can help reduce wildfire size and intensity through fuel and vegetation management, building community preparedness, and responding to wildfires with suppression efforts. Local governments can help reduce human development in fire-proof areas through proper land use management and zoning. Individual homeowners can also reduce the risk of home loss by taking action to manage the flammability of their homes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calkin|first=David E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Jack D.|last3=Finney|first3=Mark A.|last4=Thompson|first4=Matthew P.|date=2014-01-14|title=How risk management can prevent future wildfire disasters in the wildland-urban interface|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1315088111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=2|pages=746–751|doi=10.1073/pnas.1315088111|pmc=3896199|pmid=24344292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Community response ====
{{See also|Fire-adapted communities}}
One approach to mitigating fire risk is adapting communities to adapt to fire risks rather than escalate prevention efforts. Fire-adapted communities are defined by the United States Forest Service as "a knowledgeable and engaged community in which the awareness and actions of residents regarding infrastructure, buildings, landscaping, and the surrounding ecosystem lessens the need for extensive protection actions and enables the community to safely accept fire as a part of the surrounding landscape." Fostering the development of a fire-adapted community can help save resources for local and federal governments by reducing the amount of resources needed for fire mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Fire Adapted Communities|last=|first=|date=July 10, 2014|website=USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001135211/https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways homeowners can reduce risk ===
The susceptibility of a home to ignition is determined by its home ignition zone (HIZ), or the home and its surrounding area up to 100-200 feet. Individual homeowners can use the following guidelines to determine what areas of their home can be improved to mitigate fire risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|title=Home Ignition Zone Self Assessment for Homeowners|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Firewise Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430183553/https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|archive-date=April 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ways to make a house fire-resistant:
** Ensure that the house's roof is made of fire-resistant materials and all exterior walls are fire resistant.
** Enclose eaves and vents with wire mesh.
** Ensure that decks and porches are made of fire-resistant materials.
* Guidelines for landscaping:
** Keep vegetation away from windows, as windows can break during a fire and let in embers.
** Ensure plants within 3-5 feet of the home are low-growing, well-maintained and [[deciduous]].
** Keep bare dirt, mowed grass, or non-combustible mulch in a "no-grow" zone within 3-5 feet of the home.
** Limit the presence of evergreens (which are highly flammable) within 30 feet of the home.
** Keep vegetation thin within 30 to 100 feet of the home.
* Guidelines for outdoor maintenance:
** Trim back tree limbs at least 10 feet from roof.
** Ensure power lines are away from tree branches and nearby dead or dying trees.
** Clean off fallen leaves, pine needles, and other debris from roof, gutters, window wells, and underneath decks.
** Prune tree branches 6 feet up from ground (especially [[Evergreen|evergreens]]).
** Keep lawn mowed, green, and free of leaf litter and needles.
** Ensure yard is free of dead trees and shrubs.
* Ways to keep flammables at a safe distance:
** Ensure outbuildings within 30 feet of homes or other buildings are clear of flammables.
** Store firewood and other flammable materials at least 30 feet from buildings.
** Clear the area 10 feet surrounding propane tanks or fuel oil tanks.

=== Challenges to risk management ===
Wildfires are an ecological process that naturally contribute to the development of ecosystems, and many wildlands are historically predisposed to periodic fire. Because of this, complete eradication of fires in WUI regions is typically not feasible. Additionally, wildfires are capable of spreading through far distances, presenting logistical challenges to wildfire management efforts. At a governmental level, communities that have developed within or near fire-prone areas typically vary widely in terms of wildfire risk and preparedness, which can confound coordination efforts. Lastly, a mismatch between the reality of wildfire risk and sociopolitical expectations of wildland fire management services may lead to challenges to strategic risk management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Analyzing several nationally representative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], one researcher found few differences in girls' and boys' attitudes towards science in the early secondary school years.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"/&gt; Students' aspirations to pursue careers in mathematics and science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas and the level of effort they put forth in these courses.

A 1996 study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pajares | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Self-efficacy beliefs and mathematical problem-solving of gifted students | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 325–44 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1996.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that men outperform women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception.&lt;ref name="CeciWilliams2009" /&gt; Feminist scholars postulate that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Catherine, and Christianne Corbett.

A 1996 study of college freshmen by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] shows that men and women differ greatly in their intended fields of study. Of first-time college freshmen in 1996, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women planned to major in [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], while similar percentages of men and women planned to major in [[biology]] or [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]]. The differences in the intended majors between male and female first-time freshmen directly relate to the differences in the fields in which men and women earn their degree. At the post-secondary level, women are less likely than men to earn a degree in mathematics, physical sciences, or computer sciences and engineering. The exception to this gender imbalance is in the field of [[Life-science|life science]].&lt;ref name="Freshman"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1996, University of California, Los Angeles, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of underrepresentation of women in STEM careers ===
In [[Scotland]], a large number of women graduate in STEM subjects but fail to move onto a STEM career compared to men. The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] estimates that doubling women's high-skill contributions to Scotland's economy would benefit it by £170&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tapping All our Talents|date=April 2012|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/tapping-all-our-talents|location=United Kingdom|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=9780902198661|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's and women's earnings ===
{{See also|Gender pay gap}}
Female college graduates earned less on average than male college graduates, even though they shared the earnings growth of all college graduates in the 1980s. Some of the differences in salary are related to the differences in occupations entered by women and men. Among recent science and engineering bachelor's degree recipients, women were less likely than men to be employed in science and engineering occupations. There remains a wage gap between men and women in comparable scientific positions. Among more experienced scientists and engineers, the gender gap in salaries is greater than for recent graduates.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 1996, Washington, D.C.: 1996, appendix table 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries are highest in mathematics, computer science, and engineering, which are fields in which women are not highly represented. In [[Australia]], a study conducted by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] has shown that the current gender wage gap between men and women in STEM fields in Australia stands at 30.1 percent as of 2013, which is an increase of 3 percent since 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/professional-women/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2014/03/WOMEN_IN_STEM_v2.pdf|title=Women in STEM in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Professionals Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a study done by Moss, &lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;when faculty members of top research institutions in America were asked to recruit student applicants for a laboratory manager position, both men and women faculty members rated the male applicants as more hireable and competent for the position, as opposed to the female applicants who shared an identical resume with the male applicants. In the Moss study, faculty members were willing to give the male applicants a higher starting salary and career mentoring opportunities.&lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;

===Education and perception===
The percentage of PhDs in STEM fields in the U.S. earned by women is about 42%,&lt;ref name="NSF T7.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-3.xlsx |title=TABLE 7-3.

These differences start as early as the third grade according to Thomas Dee, with boys advancing in math and science and girls advancing in reading.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S. "Teachers and the Gender Gaps in Student Achievement." The Journal of Human Resources, vol. 42, no. 3, 2007, pp. 528–554. {{JSTOR|40057317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of women worldwide ==
[[UNESCO]], among other agencies including the [[European Commission]] and The Association of Academies and Societies of Sciences in Asia (AASSA), have been outspoken about the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields globally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf|title=A Complex Formula: Girls and Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Asia|date=2015|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok Office|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=She figures 2012 – Research policy and organisation – EU Bookshop|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KINA25617:EN:HTML|doi=10.2777/38520|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=28016|title=Women in Science and Technology in Asia|date=1 September 2015|website=The InterAcademy Partnership|publisher=AASSA, Gyeonggi-Do|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts to compile and interpret comparative statistics, it is necessary to exercise caution. [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has commented on the obstacles regarding the making of meaningful statistical comparisons between countries:&lt;ref name="fastlane"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Life in the fast lane: Arab women in science and technology," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 36, no. 2 (2016), p. 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on international comparisons of women in STEM fields.  Aggregate figures do not tell us much, especially since terminology describing educational levels, content of majors, job categories, and other markers varies from country to country. 
}}
Even when different countries use the same definitions of terms, the social significance of the categories may differ considerably. Koblitz remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Mathematics and gender: Some cross-cultural observations," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
It is not possible to use the same indicators to determine the situation in every country.  The significant statistic might be the percentage of women teaching at the university level.  But it might also be the proportion of women at research institutes and academies of sciences (and at what level), or the percentage of women who publish (or who publish in foreign as opposed to domestic journals), or the proportion of women who go abroad for conferences, post-graduate study, and so on, or the percentage of women awarded grants by national and international funding agencies.  Indices can have different meanings in different countries, and the prestige of various positions and honors can vary considerably.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Proportion of female graduates A Complex Formula.svg|thumb|Proportion of female graduates in science programmes in tertiary education in Asia.]]
A fact sheet published by UNESCO in March 2015&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; presented worldwide statistics of women in the STEM fields, with a focus on [[Asia]] and the Pacific region. It reports that, worldwide, 30 percent of researchers are women. In these areas, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia and West Asia had the most uneven balance, with 20 percent of researchers being women in each of those sub-regions. Meanwhile, [[Central Asia]] had the most equal balance in the region, with women comprising 46 percent of its researchers. The Central Asian countries [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were the only countries in Asia with women as the majority of their researchers, though in both cases it was by a very small margin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235155E.pdf|title=Women in Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2004, 13.9% of students enrolled in science programs in [[Cambodia]] were female and 21% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation&amp;nbsp;fields were female as of 2002. These statistics are significantly lower than those of other Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]]. According to a UNESCO report on women in STEM in Asian countries, Cambodia's education system has a long history of male dominance stemming from its male-only [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teaching practices. Starting in 1924, girls were allowed to enroll in school. Bias against women, not only in education but in other aspects of life as well, exists in the form of traditional views of men as more powerful and dignified than women, especially in the home and in the workplace, according to UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula'' states that [[Indonesia]]'s government has been working towards gender equality, especially through the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], but stereotypes about women's roles in the workplace persists. Due to traditional views and societal [[Norm (social)|norms]], women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as [[pharmacy]] and biology than in mathematics and [[physics]]. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women make up 78% of [[chemical engineering]] students but only 5% of [[mechanical engineering]] students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, only 10,874 or 31% were female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
According to UNESCO, 48.19% of students enrolled in science programs in Malaysia were female as of 2011. This number has grown significantly in the past three decades, during which the country's employment of women has increased by 95%. In Malaysia, over 50% of employees in the computer industry, which is generally a male-dominated field within STEM, are women. Of students enrolled in pharmacy, more than 70% are female, while in engineering only 36% of students are female. Women held 49% of research positions in science, technology, and innovation as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mongolia ====
According to UNESCO's data from 2012 and 2011 respectively, 40.2% of students enrolled in science programs and 49% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation in Mongolia are female.&amp;nbsp;Traditionally, [[nomad]]ic Mongol culture was fairly egalitarian, with both women and men raising children, tending livestock, and fighting in battle, which mirrors the relative equality of women and men in Mongolia's modern-day workforce. More females than males pursue higher education and 65% of college graduates in Mongolia are women. However, women earn about 19–30% less than their male counterparts and are perceived by society to be less suited to engineering than men. Thirty percent or less of employees in computer science, construction architecture, and engineering are female while three in four biology students are female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Nepal ====
As of 2011, 26.17% of [[Nepal]]'s science students were women and 19% of their engineering students were also women. In research, women held 7.8% of positions in 2010. These low percentages correspond with Nepal's patriarchal societal values. In Nepal, women that enter STEM fields most often enter forestry or medicine, specifically [[nursing]], which is perceived as a predominantly female occupation in most countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
In 2012, 30.63% of students enrolled in science programs in South Korea were female, a number that has been increasing since the digital revolution. Numbers of male and female students enrolled at most levels of education are comparable as well, though the gender difference is larger in higher education. Confucian beliefs in the lower societal value of women as well as other cultural factors could influence South Korea's STEM gender gap. In South Korea, as in other countries, the percentage of women in medicine (61.6%) is much higher than the percentage of women in engineering (15.4%) and other more math-based stem fields. In research occupations in science, technology, and innovation, women made up 17% of the workforce as of 2011. In South Korea, most women working in STEM fields are classified as "non-regular" or temporary employees, indicating poor job stability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study conducted by the University of Glasgow which examined math anxiety and test performance of boys and girls from various countries, researchers found that South Korea had a high sex difference in mathematics scores, with female students scoring significantly lower than and experiencing more math anxiety on math tests than male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoet|first=Gijsbert|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Moore|first3=Alex M.|last4=Geary|first4=David C.|date=2016-04-21|title=Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153857|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4839696|pmid=27100631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf states ====
[[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] reported&lt;ref name="fastlane"/&gt; on a series of interviews conducted in 2015 in Abu Dhabi with women engineers and computer scientists who had come to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states to find opportunities that were not available to them in their home country.  The women spoke of a remarkably high level of job satisfaction and relatively little discrimination.  Koblitz comments that

{{Quote|
...most people in most countries outside of the Middle East have no idea that the region, in particular the UAE, is a magnet for young, dynamic Arab women making successful careers for themselves in a variety of high-tech and other scientific fields; "land of opportunity," "a tech-person's paradise," and yes, even "mecca" were among the terms used to describe the UAE by the women I met.

In the [[European Union]] only 16.7% on average of ICT (Information and communication technology) specialists are women. Only in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] do women hold more that 25 percent of these roles. The gender distribution is more balanced, particularly in [[History of the European Union|new member states]] when taking into account ICT technicians (middle and low-ranking positions).&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;

In 2012 the percentage of women PhD graduates was 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, and just the 28% of PhD graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction. In the computing subfield only 21% of PhD graduates were women. In 2013 in the EU as an average men scientists and engineers made up 4.1% of total labour force, while women made up only 2.8%. In more than half of the countries women make up less than 45% of scientists and engineers. The situation has improved, as between 2008 and 2011 the number of women amongst employed scientists and engineers grew by an average of 11.1% per year, while the number of men grew only by 3.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 28 August 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are much more likely than women to have a STEM career regardless of educational attainment. Women in STEM fields earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age. On average, men in STEM jobs earn $36.34 per hour while women in STEM jobs earn $31.11 per hour.&lt;ref name="Women in STEM"/&gt;

Women dominate the total number of persons with bachelor's degrees, as well as those in STEM fields defined by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. However, they are underrepresented in specific fields including Computer Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Asian women are over-represented in STEM fields in the U.S.(though not as much as males of the same ethnicity) compared to African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American women.&lt;ref name="NCES2014"/&gt; Within academia, these minority women represent less than 1% of tenure-track positions in the top 100 U.S. universities despite constituting approximately 13% of total US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towns|first=Marcy|date=Spring 2010|title=Where Are the Women of Color?

==== African American Women ====
Prejudice and assumed stereotypes keep women of color, especially black women from studying in STEM fields. Psychologically, stereotypes on black women's intellect, cognitive abilities, and work ethic contribute to their lack of confidence in STEM. Spelman College is looking to change how the world looks at African American women, and welcomes black women helping to support them in becoming involved and technically proficient in STEM. Spelman provides the environment which cultivates creativity, intellectual thinking, and curiosity to broaden their thinking for complex solutions. 2,100 students of Spelman come from forty-four states, one territory and eleven countries, with one of the highest ranks of all institutions with black graduating with bachelors of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kimberly M.|date=Spring 2014|title=Realigning the crooked room: Spelman claims a space for African American women in STEM|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A379445373/ITOF?u=auraria_main&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=1a7ce7cd|journal=Realigning the Crooked Room: Spelman Claims a Space for African American Women in STEM|volume=16|pages=|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
According to the National Household Survey, women represented 39% of STEM graduates in Canada, as opposed to 66% in non-STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|last=Hango|first=Darcy|date=2015|website=statcan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of British Columbia]] discovered that only 20–25% of computer science students from all Canadian college and universities are women.

Statistically, women are less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability. Young men with lower marks in mathematics are more likely to pursue STEM fields than their women-identified peers with higher marks in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darcy Hango|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|date=18 Dec 2013|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underrepresentation in STEM-related awards and competitions ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, fewer have been awarded to women than to men. Between 1901 and 2017 the female:total ratio of [[Nobel Prize]]s were 2:207 for physics, 4:178 for chemistry, 12:214 for physiology/medicine, and 1:79 for economic sciences.
The ratios for other fields were 14:114 in literature and 16:104 for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/ |title=Nobel Prize Facts |publisher= NobelPrize.org |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani.

A review of UK patent applications, in 2016, found that the proportion of new inventions registered by women was rising, but that most female inventors were active in stereotypically female fields such as "designing bras and make-up". 94% of inventions in the field of computing, 96% in automotive applications and mining, and 99% in explosives and munitions, were by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New generation of inventors wanted: women need to apply|last=Keate|first=Georgie|date=27 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|pages=22–23|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Russia]] had the highest percentage of patents filed by women, at about 16%.

== Explanations for low representation of women ==
There are a variety of proposed reasons for the relatively low numbers of women in STEM fields. These can be broadly classified into societal, psychological, and innate explanations. However, explanations are not necessarily restricted to just one of these categories.

=== Societal ===
====Discrimination====
Schiebinger claims discrimination, both overt and covert, faced by women in STEM fields leads to fewer women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women.&lt;ref name=Swim1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swim|first1=J.|last2=Borgida|first2=E.|last3=Maruyama|first3=G.|last4=Myers|first4=D.G.|title=Joan McKay versus John McKay: Do gender stereotypes bias evaluations?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=105|issue=3|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, email requests were sent to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities. It was impossible to determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, since each participant only viewed a request from one potential graduate student. However, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men.&lt;ref name=Milkman2012&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Milkman| first1=K.L|last2=Akinola| first2=M.|last3=Chugh|first3=D.| title=Temporal Distance and Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012| volume=23|issue=7|pages=710–717|doi=10.1177/0956797611434539|pmid=22614463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss-Racusin|first1=C.A.|last2=Dovidio| first2=J.F.|last3=Brescoll| first3=V.L.|last4=Graham| first4=M.| last5=Handelsman|first5=J.| title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2012 |volume=109|issue=41|pages=16474–16479| doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmid=22988126| pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were the same for each participant, but each application was randomly assigned either a male or a female name. The researchers found that faculty members rated the male candidates as both more competent and more hirable than the females candidate, despite applications being otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012/&gt; If individuals are given information about a prospective student's gender, they may infer that he or she possesses traits consistent with stereotypes for that gender.&lt;ref name=Deaux1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deaux|first1=K.|last2=Lewis|first2=L.L.|title=Structure of gender stereotypes: Interrelationships among components and gender label|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=46|issue=5|pages=991–1004|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 found that men are favored in some domains, such as tenure rates in biology, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair. The authors interpreted this to suggest that the underrepresentation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref name="Ceci-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceci |first1=S.

==== Stereotypes ====
Stereotypes about what someone in a STEM field should look and act like may cause established members of these fields to overlook individuals who are highly competent.&lt;ref name=Wells1985&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary L.|title=The Conjunction Error and the Representativeness Heuristic|journal=Social Cognition| year=1985|volume=3|issue=3| pages=266–279|doi=10.1521/soco.1985.3.3.266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical scientist or individual in another STEM profession is usually thought to be male.&lt;ref name=Good2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Jessica J.|last2=Woodzicka|first2=Julie A.|last3= Wingfield|first3= Lylan C.|title=The Effects of Gender Stereotypic and Counter-Stereotypic Textbook Images on Science Performance|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=150|issue=2|pages=132–147|doi=10.1080/00224540903366552|pmid=20397590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in STEM fields may not fit individuals' conception of what a scientist, engineer, or mathematician "should" look like and may thus be overlooked or penalized. The Role Congruity Theory of Prejudice states that perceived incongruity between gender and a particular role or occupation can result in negative evaluations.&lt;ref name=Eagly2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Karau|first2=S.J.|title=Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders|journal=Psychological Review|year=2002| volume=109|issue=3| pages=573–598| doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.3.573| pmid=12088246|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia-Retamero2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Retamero|first1=R.|last2=Lopez-Zafra|first2=E.|title=Prejudice against Women in Male-congenial Environments: Perceptions of Gender Role Congruity in Leadership|journal=Sex Roles|year=2006|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=51–61|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritter2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=B.A.|last2=Yoder|first2=J.D.|title=Gender Differences in Leader Emergence Persist Even for Dominant Women: An Updated Confirmation of Role Congruity Theory|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–193|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, negative stereotypes about women's quantitative abilities may lead people to devalue their work or discourage these women from continuing in STEM fields.&lt;ref name=Miyake2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3=Finkelstein|first3=N.D.|last4 = Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science| year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008| pages=1234–1237| doi=10.1126/science.1195996 | pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women who work in "nontraditional" occupations may encounter discrimination, but the forms and consequences of this discrimination are different. Individuals of a particular gender are often perceived to be better suited to particular careers or areas of study than those of the other gender.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gaucher|first1=D.| last2=Friesen|first2=J.|last3=Kay| first3=A.C.|title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=101| issue=1|pages=109–128| doi=10.1037/a0022530|pmid=21381851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyness|first1=K.S.|last2=Heilman|first2=M.E.|title=When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper-level female and male managers|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| year=2006|volume=91| issue=4| pages=777–785| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.777|pmid=16834505|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that job advertisements for male-dominated careers tended to use more agentic words (or words denoting agency, such as "leader" and "goal-oriented") associated with male stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011/&gt; Social Role Theory, proposed in 1991, states that men are expected to display agentic qualities and women to display communal qualities.&lt;ref name=Eagly1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Wood|first2=W.|title=Explaining Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Perspective|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=306–315| doi=10.1177/0146167291173011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can influence hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Madera2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Madera|first1=J.M.|last2=Hebl|first2=M.R.|last3=Martin|first3=R.C.| title=Gender and letters of recommendation for academia: Agentic and communal differences|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=2009|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1591–1599|doi=10.1037/a0016539|pmid=19916666|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9717}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that women tended to be described in more communal terms and men in more agentic terms in letters of recommendation. These researchers also found that communal characteristics were negatively related to hiring decisions in academia.&lt;ref name=Madera2009/&gt;

Although women entering traditionally male professions face negative stereotypes suggesting that they are not "real" women, these stereotypes do not seem to deter women to the same degree that similar stereotypes may deter men from pursuing nontraditional professions. There is historical evidence that women flock to male-identified occupations once opportunities are available.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Samuel. 1985. ''The Process of Occupational Sex-Typing''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, examples of occupations changing from predominantly female to predominantly male are very rare in human history. The few existing cases—such as medicine—suggest that redefinition of the occupations as appropriately masculine is necessary before men will consider joining them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, and Deirdre English. 1978. For Her Own Good: 100 Years of Expert Advice to Women. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men in female-dominated occupations may contend with negative stereotypes about their masculinity, they may also experience certain benefits. In 1992 it was suggested that women in male-dominated occupations tended to hit a [[glass ceiling]]; while men in female-dominated occupations may hit a "glass escalator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Christine | year = 1992 | title = The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the 'Female' Professions | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–267 | jstor=3096961 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0034h}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the glass ceiling can make it difficult for women and minorities to reach the top of an occupation, the "glass escalator" allows men to excel in a profession that is female dominated.

====Black Sheep effect====
{{Main|Black sheep effect}}

The Black Sheep effect occurs when individuals are likely to evaluate members of their in-group more favorably than members of their out-group when those members are highly qualified.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=S.|last2=Biernat|first2=M.|title=Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection?|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology| year=2003|volume=39| issue=6|pages=602–609| doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=N.L.|last2=Hymes|first2=R.W.|last3=Anderson|first3=A.B.|last4=Weathers|first4=J.E.|title=Defendant-juror similarity and mock juror judgments|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1995|volume=19|issue=6|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/bf01499374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=J.|last2=Abrams|first2=D.|last3=Serodio|first3=R.G.|title=Being better by being right: Subjective group dynamics and derogation of in-group deviants when generic norms are undermined|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|issue=3|pages=436–447|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T.S.|last2=Hosch|first2=H.M.|title=An examination of jury verdicts for evidence of a similarity-leniency effect, an out-group punitiveness effect or a black sheep effect|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=2004|volume=28|issue=5|pages=587–598|doi=10.1023/b:lahu.0000046436.36228.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an individual's in-group members have average or below average qualities, he or she is likely to evaluate them much lower than out-group members with equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; This suggests that established women in STEM fields will be more likely than established men to help early career women who display sufficient qualifications. However, established women will be less likely than men to help early career women who display insufficient qualifications.

====Queen Bee effect====
The Queen Bee effect is similar to the Black Sheep effect but applies only to women. It explains why higher-status women, particularly in male-dominated professions, may actually be far less likely to help other women than their male colleagues might be.&lt;ref name=Cooper1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=V.W.|title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome|journal=Small Group Research|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=483–499|doi=10.1177/1046496497284001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellemers|first1=N.|last2=Van den Heuvel|first2=H.|last3=de Gilder|first3=D.|last4=Maass|first4=A.|last5=Bonvini|first5=A.|title=The underrepresentation of women in science: Differential commitment or the queen bee syndrome?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=315–338|doi=10.1348/0144666042037999|pmid=15479533|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1953519/Ellemers%20British%20Journal%20of%20Social%20Psychology%2043%202004%20u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that while doctoral students in a number of different disciplines did not exhibit any gender differences in work commitment or work satisfaction, faculty members at the same university believed that female students were less committed to their work than male students.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; What was particularly surprising was that these beliefs by faculty members were most strongly endorsed by female faculty members, rather than male faculty members.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; One potential explanation for this finding is that individual mobility for a member of a negatively stereotyped group is often accompanied by a social and psychological distancing of oneself from the group. This implies that successful women in traditionally male-dominated careers do not see their success as evidence that negative stereotypes about women's quantitative and analytical abilities are wrong, but rather as proof that they personally are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; Thus, such women may actually play a role in perpetuating, rather than abolishing, these negative stereotypes.

====Mentorship====
In STEM fields, the support and encouragement of a mentor can make a lot of difference in women's decisions of whether or not to continue pursuing a career in their discipline&lt;ref name=Sonnert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonnert|first1=G.|last2=Fox|first2=M.F.|last3=Adkins|first3=K.|title=Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Effects of Faculty, Fields, and Institutions Over Time|journal=Social Science Quarterly|year=2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1333–1356|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00505.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stout2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stout|first1=J.G.|last2=Dasgupta| first2=N.|last3=Hunsinger| first3=M.|last4=McManus| first4=M.A.|title=STEMing the tide: Using ingroup experts to inoculate women's self-concept in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1037/a0021385|pmid=21142376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be particularly true for younger individuals who may face many obstacles early on in their careers.&lt;ref name="Griffith2010"/&gt; Since these younger individuals often look to those who are more established in their discipline for help and guidance, the responsiveness and helpfulness of potential mentors is incredibly important.

====Lack of support====
Women in STEM may leave due to not being invited to professional meetings, the use of sexually discriminating standards against women, inflexible working conditions, the perceived need to hide pregnancies, and the struggle to balance family and work. Women in STEM fields that have children either need child care or to take a long leave of absence. When a [[nuclear family]] can not afford child care, typically it is the mother that gives up her career to stay at home with the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10 |title=These Are The 7 Things Keeping Women Out of Science Careers |last=Welsh |first=Jennifier |date=16 Oct 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to women being paid statistically less in their careers. The man makes more money so the man goes to work and the woman gives up her career. Maternity leave is another issue women in STEM fields face. In the [[Maternity leave in the United States|U.S. maternity leave]] is required by The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for mothers of newborn or newly adopted children. This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world. Unlike the United States, most countries have the right to paid time off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} If a new mother does not have external financial support or savings, they may not be able to take their full maternity leave. Few companies allow men to take paternity leave and it may be shorter than women's maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Fathers.htm |title=Paid Family Leave – Fathers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=State of California, Employment Development Department |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer paternity leaves for men could allow women to go back to work while their partners stay home with the children.

==== Harassment ====
In 1993 ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that three-quarters of women students and residents were harassed at least once during their medical training.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

==== Lack of role models ====
In engineering and science education, women made up almost 50 percent of non-tenure track lecturer and instructor jobs, but only 10 percent of tenured or tenure-track professors in 1996. In addition, the number of female department chairs in medical schools did not change from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pell|first1=A N|title=Fixing the leaky pipeline: women scientists in academia|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=74|issue=11| year=1996|pages=2843–8|issn=0021-8812| doi=10.2527/1996.74112843x|pmid=8923199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who do make it to tenured or tenure-track positions may face the difficulties associated with holding a token status. They may lack support from colleagues and may face antagonism from peers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Lips2008" /&gt; However, in 2014 a team of psychologists and economists conducted extensive analyses of national data and concluded that the state of women in STEM has changed greatly in the past two decades and any conclusions about their status based on data prior to 2000 are likely to be outdated. In general, they concluded that women had very sizable gains in academic science, including remuneration, promotion, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ceci2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Ginther|first2=Donna K.|last3=Kahn|first3=Shulamit|last4=Williams|first4=Wendy M.|title=Women in Academic Science, A Changing Landscape |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=75–141 |issn=1529-1006 |doi=10.1177/1529100614541236|pmid=26172066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been posited that more female role models would encourage more women to enter fields dominated by men, research has indicated this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Cheryan|first1 = Sapna|last2 = Siy|first2 = John Oliver|last3 = Vichayapai|first3 = Marissa|last4 = Drury|first4 = Benjamin J.|last5 = Kim|first5 = Saenam|title = Do Female and Male Role Models Who Embody STEM Stereotypes Hinder Women's Anticipated Success in STEM?|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 2|issue = 6|pages = 656–664|doi = 10.1177/1948550611405218|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's lack of interest in STEM fields may instead in part stem from stereotypes about employees and workplaces in STEM fields, to which stereotypes women are disproportionately responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/15/geeky_decor_puts_off_ladies/ |title=Ladies put off tech careers by sci-fi posters, Coke cans |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/27/girls_into_tech_cracked_at_last_sorta/ |title=Trick-cyclist's claim: I have FOUND how to get GIRLS INTO TECH |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clustering and leaky pipeline ====
In the early 1980s Rossiter put forth the concept of "territorial segregation" or [[occupational segregation]], which is the idea that women "cluster" in certain fields of study.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} For example, "women are more likely to teach and do research in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences and engineering",&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} and the majority of college women tend to choose majors such as psychology, education, English, performing arts, and nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ruchika Tulshyan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html |title=Top 10 College Majors For Women – 10: Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, Humanities |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123090031/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also used "hierarchical segregation" as an explanation for the low number of women in STEM fields.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} She describes "hierarchical segregation" as a decrease in the number of women as one "moves up the ladder of power and prestige."&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|33}} This is related to the [[STEM pipeline|leaky STEM pipeline]] concept. The metaphor of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe how women drop out of STEM fields at all stages of their careers. In the U.S., out of 2,000 high school aged persons, 1944 were enrolled in high school fall 2014.&lt;ref name="NCES d15_201.20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_201.20.asp |title=Table 201.20.

=== Psychological ===
==== Lack of interest ====
A meta-analysis concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by [[Holland Codes|RIASEC type]] (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.&lt;ref name="Su2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Rong|last2=Rounds|first2=James|last3= Armstrong|first3= Patrick|title=Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=6|pages=859–884|doi=10.1037/a0017364|pmid=19883140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-year interview study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that perceptions that non-STEM academic majors offered better education options and better matched their interests was the most common (46%) reason provided by female students for switching majors from STEM areas to non-STEM areas. The second most frequently cited reason given for switching to non-STEM areas was a reported loss of interest in the women's chosen STEM majors. Additionally, 38% of female students who remained in STEM majors expressed concerns that there were other academic areas that might be a better fit for their interests.&lt;ref name="Seymour1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Seymour | first=Elaine | title=Talking about leaving : why undergraduates leave the sciences | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO, USA | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8133-6642-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preston's (2004) survey of 1,688 individuals who had left sciences also showed that 30 percent of the women endorsed "other fields more interesting" as their reason for leaving.&lt;ref name="Preston2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Preston | first=Anne | title=Leaving science : occupational exit from scientific careers | publisher=Russell Sage Foundation | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-87154-694-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced math skills do not often result in a woman being interested in a STEM career. A [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that even young women of high mathematical ability are much less likely to enter a STEM field than young men of similar or even lesser ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Lack of confidence ====
Research has found that women steer away from STEM fields because they believe they are not qualified for them; the study suggested that this could be fixed by encouraging girls to participate in more mathematics classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/new_study_into_lack_of_women_in_tech_its_not_the_mens_fault/?mt=1437990843635 |title=New study into lack of women in Tech: It's NOT the men's fault |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors behind girls' lack of confidence might be unqualified or ineffective teachers.

Out of STEM-intending students, 35% of women stated that their reason for leaving calculus was due to lack of understanding the material, while only 14% of men stated the same.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; The study reports that this difference in reason for leaving calculus is thought to develop from women's low level of confidence in their ability, and not actual skill. This study continues to establish that women and men have different levels of confidence in their ability and that confidence is related to how individual's performance in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; It was seen in another study that when men and women of equal math ability were asked to rate their own ability, women will rate their own ability at a much lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chipman|first=Susan|date=September 1992|title=Mathematics Anxiety and Science Careers Among Able College Women|url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5|pages=292–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs with the purpose to reduce anxiety in math or increase confidence have a positive impact on women continuing their pursuit of a career in the STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Stephanie|date=October 2013|title=For Girls in STEM, Belonging, Not Brain Structure, Makes the Difference|url=|journal=Techniques: Connecting Education &amp; Careers|volume=88 |issue=7|pages=34–36|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the issue of confidence keep women from even entering STEM fields, but even women in upper-level courses with higher skill are more strongly affected by the stereotype that they (by nature) do not possess innate ability to succeed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Julia|date=November–December 2012|title=Calculus GPA and Math Identification as Moderators of Stereotype Threat in Highly Persistent Women|url=|journal=Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=34 |issue=6|pages=534–543|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a negative effect on confidence for women despite making it through courses designed to filter students out of the field.

====Stereotype threat====
Stereotype threat arises from the fear that one's actions will confirm a negative stereotype about one's in-group. This fear creates additional stress, consuming valuable cognitive resources and lowering task performance in the threatened domain.&lt;ref name=Schmader2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=T.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|title=Converging evidence that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=3|pages=440–452|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Aronson|first2=J.|title=Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=797–811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2002&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Spencer|first2=S.J.|last3=Aronson|first3=J.|title=Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|year=2002|volume=34|pages=379–440|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(02)80009-0|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are susceptible to stereotype threat whenever they are assessed in a domain for which there is a perceived negative stereotype about a group to which they belong.

Negative stereotypes about girls’ capabilities in mathematics and science drastically lower their performance in mathematics and science courses as well as their interest in pursuing a STEM career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bork/women-in-science_b_1327752.html |title=STEM Fields: Where Are the Women? |last=Bork |first=Christine |date= 2012-03-08|website= |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that gender differences in performance disappear if students are told that there are no gender differences on a particular mathematics test.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999/&gt; This indicates that the learning environment can greatly impact success in a course.

Stereotype threat has been criticized on a theoretical basis.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998 {{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}}, Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that 
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

A study&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was done to determine how stereotype threat and math identification can affect women who were majoring in a STEM related field. There were three different situations, designed to test the impact of stereotype on performance in math. One group of women were informed that men had previously out-performed women on the same calculus test they were about to take. The next group was told men and women had performed at the same level. The last group was told nothing about how men had performed and there was no mention of gender before taking their test. Out of these situations, women performed at their best scores when there was no mention of gender. The worst scores were from the situation where women were told that men had performed better than women. For women to pursue the male-dominated field of STEM, previous research shows that they must have more confidence in math/science ability.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

Some studies propose the explanation that STEM fields (and especially fields like physics, math and philosophy) are considered by both teachers and students to require more innate talent than skills that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-from-stem-42967 |title=Beliefs about innate talent may dissuade students from STEM |last=Miller |first=David |date=9 Jun 2015 |website= |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a tendency to view women as having less of the required innate abilities, researchers propose this can result in assessing women as less qualified for STEM positions. In a study done by Ellis, Fosdick and Rasmussen, it was concluded that without strong skills in calculus, women cannot perform as well as their male counterparts in any field of STEM, which leads to the fewer women pursuing a career in these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Jessica|last2=Fosdick|first2=Bailey K.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Chris|title=Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave STEM Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men: Lack of Mathematical Confidence a Potential Culprit|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|year=2016|pages=1–14|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447|pmid=27410262|pmc=4943602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high percentage of women that do pursue a career in STEM do not continue on this pathway after taking Calculus I, which was found to be a class that weeds out students from the STEM pathway.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

There have been several controversial statements about innate ability and success in STEM. A few notable examples include [[Lawrence Summers]], former president of [[Harvard University]] who suggested cognitive ability at high end positions could cause a population difference. Summers later stepped down as president.&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}. January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Google engineer, James Damore, wrote a memo entitled [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] suggesting that differences in trait distributions between men and women was a reason for gender imbalance in STEM. The memo stated that [[affirmative action]] to reduce the gap could discriminate against highly qualified male candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google |title=Here Are the Citations for the Anti-Diversity Manifesto Circulating at Google |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise | last2=Koebler |first2=Jason | last3=Emerson |first3=Sarah  |date=7 Aug 2017 |website= |publisher=Vice |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damore was fired for sending out this memo.

== Strategies for increasing representation of women ==
[[File:15208-event-CMS Girls Engineering Camp-6655 (18682448435).jpg|thumb|The CMS Girls Engineering Camp at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]] in June 2015]]

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the low representation of women in STEM careers. [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the first woman to hold the position of Director of Policy Planning for the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/slaughter | title=Anne-Marie Slaughter  |website=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently suggested some strategies to the corporate and political environment to support women to fulfill to the best of their abilities the many roles and responsibilities that they undertake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters/article/1225099--finding-a-work-life-balance Finding a work-life-balance], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and research environment for women may benefit by applying some of the suggestions she has made to help women excel, while maintaining a work-life balance.

===Social-psychological interventions===
A number of researchers have tested interventions to alleviate stereotype threat for women in situations where their math and science skills are being evaluated. The hope is that by combating stereotype threat, these interventions will boost women's performance, encouraging a greater number of them to persist in STEM careers.

One simple intervention is simply educating individuals about the existence of stereotype threat. Researchers found that women who were taught about stereotype threat and how it could negatively impact women's performance in math performed as well as men on a math test, even when stereotype threat was induced. These women also performed better than women who were not taught about stereotype threat before they took the math test.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Michael|last2=Schmader|first2=Toni|last3= Martens|first3= Andy|title=Knowing Is Half the Battle: Teaching Stereotype Threat as a Means of Improving Women's Math Performance|journal=Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=175–179|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x|pmid=15733195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role models====
One of the proposed methods for alleviating stereotype threat is through introducing role models. One study found that women who took a math test that was administered by a female experimenter did not suffer a drop in performance when compared to women whose test was administered by a male experimenter.&lt;ref name=Marx2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=D.M.|last2=Roman|first2=J.S.|title=Female role models: Protecting women's math performance|journal=Personality and Social Bulletin|year=2002|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1183–1193|doi=10.1177/01461672022812004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these researchers found that it was not the physical presence of the female experimenter but rather learning about her apparent competence in math that buffered participants against stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Marx2002 /&gt; 
The findings of another study suggest that role models do not necessarily have to be individuals with authority or high status, but can also be drawn from peer groups. This study found that girls in same-gender groups performed better on a task that measured math skills than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguet|first1=P.|last2=Regner|first2=I.|title=Stereotype threat among schoolgirls in quasi-ordinary classroom circumstances|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2007|volume=99|issue=3|pages=545–560|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fact that girls in the same-gender groups had greater access to positive role models, in the form of their female classmates who excelled in math, than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007 /&gt; 
Similarly, another experiment showed that making groups achievements salient helped buffer women against stereotype threat. Female participants who read about successful women, even though these successes were not directly related to performance in math, performed better on a subsequent math test than participants who read about successful corporations rather than successful women.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=R.B.|last2=Paulson|first2=R.M.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|title=Alleviating women's mathematics stereotype threat through salience of group achievements|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(02)00513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study investigating the role of textbook images on science performance found that women demonstrated better comprehension of a passage from a chemistry lesson when the text was accompanied by a counter-stereotypic image (i.e., of a female scientist) than when the text was accompanied by a stereotypic image (i.e., of a male scientist).&lt;ref name=Good2010 /&gt;
Other scholars distinguish between the challenges of both recruitment and retention in increasing women's participation in STEM fields. These researchers suggest that although both female and male role models can be effective in recruiting women to STEM fields, female role models are more effective at promoting the retention of women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Drury2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Siy|first2=John Oliver|last3= Cheryan|first3= Sapna|title=When Do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=265–269|doi=10.1080/1047840x.2011.620935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers can also act as role models for young girls. Reports have shown that the presence of female teachers positively influences girls' perceptions of STEM and increases their interest in STEM careers.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bottía|first2=Martha Cecilia|last3=Davalos|first3=Eleonora|last4=Mickelson|first4=Roslyn Arlin|last5=Moller|first5=Stephanie|last6=Valentino|first6=Lauren|date=2016-02-01|title=Demographic Characteristics of High School Math and Science Teachers and Girls' Success in STEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/1/87/1845557|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=87–110|doi=10.1093/socpro/spv027|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-affirmation====
Researchers have investigated the usefulness of self-affirmation in alleviating stereotype threat. One study found that women who affirmed a personal value prior to experiencing stereotype threat performed as well on a math test as men and as women who did not experience stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Martens2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martens|first1=A.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|last3= Greenberg|first3= J.|last4=Schimel|first4=J.|title=Combating stereotype threat: The effect of self-affirmation on women's intellectual performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=236–243|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.010|hdl=10092/507}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study found that a short writing exercise in which college students, who were enrolled in an introductory physics course, wrote about their most important values substantially decreased the gender performance gap and boosted women's grades.&lt;ref name=Miyake2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3= Finkelstein|first3= N.D.|last4=Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008|pages=1234–1237|doi=10.1126/science.1195996|pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the effectiveness of such values-affirmation exercises is their ability to help individuals view themselves as complex individuals, rather than through the lens of a harmful stereotype. Supporting this hypothesis, another study found that women who were encouraged to draw self-concept maps with many nodes did not experience a performance decrease on a math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gresky|first1=D.M.|last2=Eyck|first2=L.L.T.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|last4=McIntyre|first4=R.B.|title=Effects of salient multiple identities on women's performance under mathematics stereotype threat|journal=Sex Roles|year=2005|volume=53|issue=9–10|pages=703–716|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who did not draw self-concept maps or only drew maps with a few nodes did perform significantly worse than men on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt; The effect of these maps with many nodes was to remind women of their "multiple roles and identities," that were unrelated to, and would thus not be harmed by, their performance on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt;

=== Organized efforts ===
Organizations such as [[Girls Who Code]], StemBox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2218287/stembox-girls-in-stem/|title=Introducing StemBox, Birchbox's Super Smart Little Sister|access-date=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blossom, Engineer Girl, [http://womanity.org/programs/afghanistan/ Girls Can Code] in Afghanistan, [http://robotixedu.com/indian-girls-code/ @IndianGirlsCode], and Kode with Klossy (spearheaded by supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]]) aim to encourage women and girls to explore male-dominated STEM fields. Many of these organizations offer summer programs and scholarships to girls interested in STEM fields. The U.S. government has funded similar endeavors; the Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs created TechGirls and TechWomen, exchange programs which teach Middle Eastern and North African girls and women skills valuable in STEM fields and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/03/205866.htm|title=Advancing the Status of Women and Girls Around the World|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [https://unesco.usmission.gov/teachher/ TeachHer Initiative], spearheaded by UNESCO, Costa Rican First Lady, [[Mercedes Peñas Domingo]], and [[Dr. Jill Biden]] which aims to close the gender gap in STEAM curricula and careers. The Initiative also emphasizes the importance of after school activities and clubs for girls.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

The '''École nationale des chartes''' is a French ''[[grande école]]'' and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University]] specialised in historical sciences. It was founded in 1821 and was located first at the National Archives, then at the Palais de la Sorbonne (5th arrondissement). In October 2014, it moved to 65 rue de Richelieu (University of Paris II), opposite to the Richelieu-Louvois Site of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]]. The school is administered by the [[Ministère de l'enseignement supérieur et de la recherche|Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research]]. It holds the status of ''grand établissement''. Its students, who are recruited by competitive examination and hold the status of trainee civil servant, receive the qualification of archivist-paleographer after completing a thesis. They generally go on to follow a career as heritage curators in the archive and visual fields, as library curators or as lecturers and researchers in the human and social sciences. In 2005, the school also introduced [[Master degree|Master’s degrees]], for which students were recruited based on an application file, and, in 2011, [[doctorates]].

==History==

The École des chartes was created by order of [[Louis XVIII]] on 22 February 1821,&lt;ref&gt;Royal Decree of 22 February 1821 establishing a School of Charts, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; although its roots are in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the Napoleonic period. The Revolution, during which property was confiscated, congregations were suppressed and competencies were transferred from the Church to the State, produced radical cultural changes. In 1793 the feudist Antoine Maugard approached the public instruction committee of the Convention with a proposal for a project of historical and diplomatic education. The project was never carried out, and Maugard was largely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Project revived in 1891 by Gustave Servois, general guard of the National Archives:  "Projet d'un enseignement historique et diplomatique à la Bibliothèque nationale sous la Convention", ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1891, volume 52, p. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was finally created by the philologist and anthropologist [[Joseph Marie de Gérando]], baron of the Empire and general secretary to Champagny, the Minister of the Interior. In 1807 he submitted a proposal to [[Napoleon]] for the creation of a school to train young scholars of history.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the Baron of Gérando to Mr. Marial Delpit, 6 April 1839, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon examined the proposal and declared that he wished to develop a much larger specialist history school.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Vallet de Viriville, "Notes et documents pouvant servir à l'histoire de l'école royale des chartes. Recherches sur le projet présenté à l'Empereur en 1807, par le baron de Gérando", in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1848, volume 9, p. 153-176.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gérando was posted to Italy on an administrative mission, and the project was interrupted. At the end of 1820, Gérando convinced [[Joseph Jérôme, Comte Siméon|Count Siméon]], a philosopher and professor of law who had been state councilor under the Empire and who was at that time Minister of the Interior, of the usefulness of an institution modeled on the ''[[grandes écoles]]'', dedicated to the study of “a branch of French literature”,&lt;ref&gt;"Rapport adressé au roi Louis XVIII le 22 February 1821 par M. le comte Siméon, ministre de l'Intérieur", in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the charters. The 1820s were a favorable period for the creation of the École des chartes. This was firstly because the atmosphere of nostalgia for the Middle Ages created a desire to train specialists who would, by carrying out a direct study of archives and manuscripts confiscated during the Revolution, be able to renew French historiography. Secondly, the need was also felt to maintain this branch of study, which stemmed from Maurist tradition, since the field was endangered by a lack of knowledgeable collaborators in the “science of charters and manuscripts”. And thirdly, during the reign of Louis XVIII, a period which saw the return of the Ultras and during which the constitutional monarchy was called into question, the political context influenced the creation of an institution whose name inevitably made explicit reference to the defense of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Lara Jennifer Moore, Restoring order. "The École des Chartes and the Organization of Archives and Libraries in France, 1820-1870", Duluth (Minn.), Litwin Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the order of 1821, twelve students were nominated by the Minister of the Interior, based on propositions by the ''Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres''[[&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 2, in the library of Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes, 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;]], and they were paid&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 1, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit&lt;/ref&gt; during the two years of their studies. They principally studied [[paleography]] and [[philology]], with a purely practical aim: to be able to read and understand the documents that they would be responsible for curating.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 3, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors and students of the school were placed under the authority of the curator of medieval manuscripts of the Royal Library, rue de Richelieu, and of the general guard of the Archives of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 5, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first experience was not very successful, mainly because no job openings were reserved for the students. The first course was implemented in two stages by the ministerial decree of 11 May (for the Royal Library course) and by the decree of 21 December 1821 (for the Archives of the Kingdom course), and was the only one run. The ''Académie'' did put forward a new list of candidates,&lt;ref&gt;L’École, son histoire, son œuvre. Livre du centenaire, Paris, Auguste Picard, 1921, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the course length was set at two years&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 16 July 1823, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Order of 16 July 1823, but lessons had to be suspended on 19 December 1823 due to a lack of students. However, following a long period of inactivity, the Ministry of the Interior decided to re-open the school. Rives, the director of staff of the ministry, together with [[Dacier]], drew up a report on the reorganization of the School and a draft order,&lt;ref&gt;Martial Delpit, Notice historique sur l'École royale des Chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1839-1840, volume 1. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to [[Charles X]] by [[La Bourdonnaye]], which resulted in the order of 11 November 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 11 November 1829 containing the reorganization of the École des chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The school was now open to anyone who had acquired the Baccalaureate, but six to eight students were selected by competitive examination at the end of the first year. They received a salary and followed two further years of training. On completion of their studies, they received the qualification of archivist-paleographer and were reserved half of the available jobs in libraries and archives. The first valedictorian was [[Alexandre Teulet]].

The "[[Guizot]] period" benefited the École des chartes, which soon became an important institution in the field of historical – particularly medieval – studies. On 24 March 1839 the Société de l’École des chartes&lt;ref&gt;Chronique et Mélanges, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1889, volume 50. p. 278-289&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Louis Douët d’Arcq, among others, and it published the Bibliothèque de l’École des Chartes, one of the oldest French scientific reviews, to disseminate the work carried out in the school. The Order of 31 December 1846&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 31 décembre 1846, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1847, volume 8, p. 170-173&lt;/ref&gt; implemented a fundamental reorganization of the school and its study program, which then remained unchanged for more than a century. The students, who were holders of the Baccalaureate, were recruited by examination (which shortly afterwards became a competitive examination), and followed a three-year course of studies. Interdisciplinarity, an essential characteristic of the school, was then written into the reform, which required students to study six subjects, some of which were not taught anywhere else. The second innovation, a thesis, was introduced, with the first public defense being held in 1849. A surveillance council was set up, consisting of the guard of the Archives, the director of the Royal Library, the director of the School and five members of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres]]. The school was finally provided with a new statute. It moved to the Kingdom Archives in the [[hôtel de Soubise]], in the oval hall and adjacent rooms of the hôtel de Clisson.

[[File:Eleves Ecole des chartes 1857.jpg|thumb|left|The students of 1857]]

By now, the École des chartes had become a point of reference in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frédéricq, ''L'enseignement supérieur de l'histoire à Paris, notes et impressions de voyage'' in ''Revue internationale de l'enseignement'', 2e semestre 1883,p. 746-752 [archive] : "The École des chartes to me appeared to be an institution without equal. Together with the École pratique des hautes Études, it offers the most solid, most complete, most truly scientific historical education in Paris. Other countries envy France its already venerable École des chartes. Germany, so well equipped with history and auxiliary science universities, as yet has no counterpart to my knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Its historical research methodology had been greatly modernized, as had its teaching methods, thanks to the copies of ancient documents to which it had access. The students were taught paleography, sigillography, numismatics, philology, filing for archives and libraries, historical geography, currencies, systems of weights and measures, the history of political institutions in France, archeology, civil law, canonic law and feudal law. The teaching had both a scientific and a professional aim.

Thus, by gradually integrating into the network of royal then national and departmental archive services, the graduates of the school contributed to the densification of the network and to the improvement of archivist principles. A pathway for the graduates was thus established in the archives, first implemented by the Order of 31 December 1846, then reinforced by a legislative framework providing them with a means to enforce this law. The decree of 4 February 1850 reserved the posts of departmental archivist to those holding the qualification of archivist-paleographer,&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent Mollet, 'La conquête des archives départementales', dans ''École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', [[Yves-Marie Bercé]], [[Olivier Guyotjeannin]], [[Marc Smith (palaeographer)|Marc Smith]] (dir.), Thionville, Gérard Klopp, 1997, p. 253-262.&lt;/ref&gt; while all the job posts at the National Archives (except the position of senior civil servant) were reserved for them by the decree of 14 May 1887. The same could not be said of libraries. The order of 1839&lt;ref&gt;Order of 29 February 1939, articles 15 et 26 relating to the École des chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  was never applied, and although the order of 1839 reserved places at the Royal Library for École des chartes graduates, fewer than 7% of them worked in a library in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Henri-Jean Martin, « Les chartistes et les bibliothèques », Bulletin des bibliothèques de France, 1972, no 12,p. 529-537 [archive] : In 1867, of 222 alumni of the École des chartes, only 15 found employment as librarians, 13 of them in Paris and two elsewhere in France.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the end of the Second Empire, partly thanks to the work of [[Léopold Delisle]], the general administrator of the national library, that the qualifications of the school’s graduates were recognized by libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See Louis Desgraves, Quelques éminents bibliothécaires : galerie, in ''École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit., p. 263-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Little by little, decrees and orders facilitated their access to jobs in libraries.

The school moved in 1866 into more suitable premises in the hôtel de Breteuil, rue des Francs-Bourgeois, without this move having much effect on the teaching. Seven professorships were instituted by the decree of 30 January 1869: paelography; Latin languages; bibliography; filing for libraries and archives; diplomacy; political, administrative and judiciary institutions in France; civil and canonic law of the Middle Ages and archeology of the Middle Ages. Apart from minor modifications, these remained unchanged until 1955. The school moved once again in 1897, to 19 rue de la Sorbonne, into the premises originally intended for the Paris Faculté de théologie catholique. This move brought the school geographically closer to the other research and teaching institutions based at the Sorbonne, such as the Faculté de lettres and the École pratique des hautes études. The school had a classroom, with windows along both sides and special deep desks for paleography practice, as well as a library, in which books were available for immediate access.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hottin, Le 19, rue de la Sorbonne, l’École ses bâtiments, sa décoration, dans ''L’École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit., p. 142-148. Text available on HAL-SHS (notice halshs-00087473 [archive])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the premises have been refurbished, the school is still located here today. During the 1920s, a number of moves to other premises were proposed,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hottin, ''L’École des chartes : institutionnalité et architecture''. Text available on HAL-SHS (notice halshs-00089095 [archive])&lt;/ref&gt; with suggestions including the [[hôtel de Rohan]] in 1924, the garden of the Institution for Deaf-Mutes (suggested by Michel Roux-Spitz), a plot on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, a house on rue de Vaugirard, the former Polytechnic School, and the refectory of the Bernardins. The school will move in 2015 to the Richelieu area, into new premises at 65 rue de Richelieu and 12 rue des Petits-Champs. The school was also a founding member of the Campus Condorcet,&lt;ref&gt;Decree no. 2012-286 of 28 February 2012 establishing Campus Condorcet, a public institution of scientific cooperation [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, some of its research activities were conducted at the Aubervilliers campus.

The image of the École des chartes, in political and social terms, was firmly anchored, even though it has sometimes been classified as a right-wing institution.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dumoulin, « Histoire et historiens de droite », in Jean-François Sirinelli (dir.), ''Histoire des droites en France'', volume 2, « Cultures », Éditions Gallimard, collection « Tel », 2006,p. 361-362&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the "right-wing chartiste" originated in the figure of the "amateur", the son of a well-off family, passing through the school to kill time elegantly, or to "wait", in the words of Robert Martin du Gard,&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Joly, 'Les chartistes et la politique', dans ''L’École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit.,p. 169-178&lt;/ref&gt; who graduated from the school in 1905. In fact, throughout the 19th century there was a discontinuity between the high-prestige training offered by the École des chartes and the lower-prestige, modestly remunerated jobs open to graduates. However, this reputation was at least partly unfounded, as demonstrated by several cases. At the time of the [[Dreyfus Affair]],&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Joly, 'L'École des chartes et l'Affaire Dreyfus', in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1989, volume 147.p. 611-671 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the milieu of the École des chartes mirrored the divisions in French society: “Nowhere were civic quarrels more completely invested in the job of historian”.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Rebérioux, 'Histoire, historiens et dreyfusisme', in ''Revue historique'', t. 255, 1976, p. 407-432, à la p. 425. Cited by Bertrand Joly, L'École des chartes et l'Affaire Dreyfus, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  The few chartistes who were called upon as experts during the Zola process – [[Arthur Giry]], [[Auguste Molinier]], [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]], [[Paul Viollet]] and [[Gaston Paris]] – and who were involved in the founding of the League of Human Rights were attacked by other archivist-paleographers, including Robert de Lasteyrie, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]] and Émile Couard, as well as by their students at the École des chartes. The variety of engagements at the time of the Dreyfus Affair did not necessarily reflect the political sensitivities of those involved, and their motives were political as well as professional, jeopardizing the very training and methods of the school.&lt;ref&gt;See Laurent Ferri. 'Émile Zola et « ces messieurs de l’École des chartes »' in the Dreyfus Affair : unpublished, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 2006, volume 164, livraison 2. p. 595-603 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was conservative to some extent, the school admitted a female student, Geneviève Acloque, in 1906, long before the other ''grandes écoles'' had started admitting women. The École des chartes may have been perceived as a bastion of the French Action during the interwar period, although several relatively prominent alumni, such as Georges Bataille or Roger Martin du Gard, seem to have been more left-leaning. During the Second World War, there were therefore more École des chartes students and teachers on the side of the Resistance than on the side of Vichy. Bertrand Joly concludes that the school was largely neutral, in that each “wing” seems to have been equally represented, a neutrality that was also justified by the fact that the school was not big enough for its members to have a significant effect on national politics.

The entrance examination and internal examinations of the École des chartes were reformed at the beginning of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Decrees of 19 June 1931, 16 March 1931 and 5 October 1932&lt;/ref&gt; At this time,&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 22 February 1932 ; decrees of 29 April 1933 and 29 November 1933&lt;/ref&gt; the school began offering the qualification of diplôme technique de bibliothécaire (DTB) 34, which was required to obtain a job as a librarian in first-category municipal libraries or [[university libraries]]. The school opened its classes on the history of books and bibliography to external students preparing for the qualification. This practice continued until 1950, when the ''diplôme supérieur de bibliothécaire'' (DSB) replaced the DTB as the qualification for librarians.

The mid-20th century was a difficult period for the school as it struggled to modernize. Its student numbers dropped sharply (there were only 11 archivist-paleographers in the class of 1959&lt;ref&gt;Chroniques, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1959, volume 117, p. 386 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt;). Its training was considered to be outdated and lacking in the latest approaches to history, notably the historiographic revival of the [[Annales School]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Renoult, 'Les formations à la recherche de leurs réformes', in ''Histoire des bibliothèques françaises'', 2e éd., volume IV, p. 847-858, particularly p. 848.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1990s, when the entrance examination and teaching were reformed and a new policy was introduced, that the school really saw a revival. It entered a period of development under the direction of Yves-Marie Bercé (1992-2001) and Anita Guerreau-Jalabert (2001-2006). The current development of the school is based on solid training in new technologies and their application to the conservation of cultural heritage, and closer, more structured links with French universities and similar institutions in other European countries. The teaching has also been restructured to be better suited to the current demands of scientific research and evolution in conservation jobs. This approach will be introduced gradually as of the academic year 2014-15.

Since the current director, Jean-Michel Leniaud, took up his post in 2011, the school has once more reformed its entrance examination to focus student recruitment on the specifics of the training, while also expanding the training to a broader field of human and social sciences, adapting it to the European context and recruitment conditions within conservation organizations. The range of subjects taught, which was expanded in the 1990s to include history of art, now also includes archeology, history of contemporary law, and history of property law. The course has been extended from three years to three years and nine months, aligning training in fundamental scientific techniques with empowerment in conservation jobs. In no other social and human sciences institution is the study of history, philology and law integrated to this extent into the conservation of archives, books monuments and works of art, be they inventories, historic monuments or museums.

As well as improving the recruitment process and upgrading the training of future archivist-paleographers, the school has introduced specialized Master’s programs focusing on digital technologies adapted to the humanities. It has recently introduced a continuing training service that takes into account the ''validation des acquis de l’expérience (VAE)'' (a certification accrediting work experience).
The school’s collaboration with the Établissement Public de Coopération Scientific (Campus Condorcet Paris-Aubervilliers), the ComUE heSam University and the Sorbonne Universities demonstrates the new directions that it has taken in recent years. To this end, it has modernized its administration, implemented ambitious communications programs and established a new campus opposite the National Library on rue de Richelieu. It is thus preparing to fulfill as effectively as possible the public service role assigned to it by the government.

==Missions==
The École nationale des chartes is regulated by the statute of 27 January 1984, modified by statute no. 2013-660 of 22 July 2013 which relates to higher education and research. Article 3 of decree no. 87-832 of 8 October 1897 modified by decree no. 2005-1751 of 30 December 2005 defines the missions of the school as follows:
"The mission of the École nationale des chartes is to provide training for the scientific staff of archives and libraries. It trains those who contribute to scientific knowledge and the protection of national heritage. It engages in the training and research of students in the human and social sciences, particularly in disciplines relating to critical study, exploitation, conservation and communication of historic sources.”

==Organization==
The governing bodies are composed of the director of the School, the administrative council and the scientific council. 
The director is selected from among the directors of studies of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], the École nationale des chartes and the École française d’Extrême-Orient, or from among professors of the universities and members of affiliated institutions. The director is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic for a term of five years, renewable once under the conditions of article.
The director is assisted by a director of studies and a general director of services. 
The administrative council,&lt;ref&gt;The councils of the École des Chartes [archive]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 21 members, includes four unelected members, ten members appointed by the minister responsible for higher education, two of whom are members of the Institute, and seven elected members, three of whom are teachers, two of whom are IATOS (non-teaching staff) and two of whom are students. 
The scientific council37, headed by the director of the School, includes all the teachers who are directors of studies, as well as other unelected members. It also includes fifteen appointed members, five of whom are members of the Institute, as well as an elected teacher and a student representative. 
The Paris [[:fr:Unité régionale de formation à l'information scientifique et technique|URFIST]] (an inter-academic research and training body) and the Committee of Historical and Scientific Work are affiliated with the l'École des chartes.

==Training==

=== Archivist-paleographers ===

==== Entrance examinations ====
French students are recruited by competitive examination prepared in literary-oriented ''[[classes préparatoires]]'' in and outside Paris. Since 1991, it has been divided into two sections:
* The Section A, “Classics”. This includes, among other subjects, [[medieval history]], [[modern history]] and [[Latin]]. Studies at the School require fluency in Latin. 
* Section B, "Modern". This is part of the École normale supérieure’s ''banque d’epreuves littéraires'' (BEL), a set of entrance examinations valid for several schools, and includes [[modern history]], [[contemporary history]] and modern languages among its subjects.

Students prepare for the entrance examination in dedicated ''[[classes préparatoires]]'', the first year of which is known as “hypochartes” and the second year “chartes”. Depending on the school, students preparing for examination A and those preparing for examination B may be grouped into a single cohort with different options, or they may be divided into two different cohorts. Those preparing for Section B can be grouped into ''[[:fr:Classes préparatoires littéraires|khâgnes]]'' with additional options. 
Candidates who can provide proof of at least a [[bachelor’s degree]] in theory may take an examination to be allowed to proceed directly into the second year. This examination is aimed at candidates who are already conducting research at an advanced level. 
There is now a limit on the number of candidates taking the entrance examination. It was reduced from 30 to 20 in three years, which was lower than the number of jobs available to graduates of the school ( in archives, libraries, museums, etc.).

==== Status of the students ====
[[File:Fer a cheval ENC n05.jpg|left|thumb|The "Horseshoe Room" on the first floor of the library]]
Students recruited by competitive examination can assume the status of trainee civil servants, being paid (currently approximately €1250/month net) in exchange for committing to a ten-year engagement. Those who pass the examination may choose whether or not to accept this status. Foreign students who are recruited by examination or on the basis of qualifications (according to the international selection procedure) are not remunerated while they follow the course, although they can apply for a scholarship.

The course duration is three years and nine months 38. At the end of their studies, the students submit a [[thesis]], which qualifies them as [[:fr:Archiviste paléographe|archivist-paleographers]].

Those who have fulfilled their third-year obligations can apply for two ''[[:fr:École d'application|écoles d’application]]'' : the [[:fr:École nationale supérieure des sciences de l'information et des bibliothèques|École nationale supérieure des sciences de l’information et des bibliothèques]] (Enssib,reserved competitive examination&lt;ref&gt;A number of positions as State Curators are reserved for Chartists, but no positions as territorial curators are reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)|Institut national du patrimoine]] (INP). Following their studies in these schools, they may join the professions of either curators of libraries or curators of heritage. Each year, a number of students sit the INP’s examination in the visual branches (Museums, Historic Monuments and Inventories) or the ''agrégation'' examination (History, Classic or Modern Letters and Grammar), thus following either a research-oriented or a teaching-oriented career path.

==== Training and teaching ====
The course takes place over eight semesters, of which six are dedicated to teaching. As well as a common core of subjects, students choose options according to their scientific and professional objectives. These options can be taken externally through a university. Internships play an important role, with a five-month compulsory internship in an institution in the field of conservation (e.g. archives, libraries, museums, or heritage or archeological services) in France, and three months in a similar institution abroad. 
The principal subjects studied are:&lt;ref&gt;Complete list of modules by semester on the website of the École [archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Latin and French [[paleography]] (plus other languages in seminars)
* archiving, diplomacy and history of the institutions that have produced these archives (medieval, modern and contemporary)
* history of civil and canon law
* history of contemporary law
* Roman [[philology]]
* [[medieval Latin]]
* history of art (medieval, modern and contemporary)
* archeology
* editing of texts
* [[bibliography]]
* [[history of books]]
* manuscripts and medieval literary texts
* statistics and cartography for the study of history
* modern languages and IT
ECTS credits are allocated to the subjects, making it possible for students from universities or other ''grandes écoles'' to follow some of them and for the subjects to be included in the external students’ Master’s qualifications. This is made possible by the new [[:fr:Réforme Licence-Master-Doctorat|LMD reform]], which harmonizes French academic qualifications with other European ones. Classes are also open to independent auditors.

=== Master’s ===
[[File:Grande salle ENC n3.jpg|thumb|The "Great Room" (a classroom) with a mural depicting the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]
In 2006 the École des chartes introduced a Master’s program in Digital Technologies Applied to History, and has since then trained approximately 20 students per year.&lt;ref&gt;The Master’s course on the website of the École [archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, all students take the same basic modules plus three options (archiving, history of books and media, and history of art). The first year of the Master’s is a continuance of the École des chartes undergraduate training. In the second year, students follow more specialized training in the field of IT applied to webcasting. There are two possible paths, one more research-oriented and the other, which is more vocational, oriented towards the dissemination of knowledge in a heritage service.

In 2011, the École des chartes introduced a further two Master’s courses. The first, in Medieval Studies, is offered in partnership with the École normale supérieure, the University of Paris III and the University of Paris IV. Its aim is to “provide training in literary research for medieval texts, with an interdisciplinary approach in the context of specialization in the Middle Ages”.  The second, run in partnership with the [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]] and the [[:fr:Institut national de l'audiovisuel|Institut national de l’audiovisuel]], is in Audiovisual Design: Plurimedial Representations of History, Society and Science. It aims to “train designers and makers of audiovisual documentaries (for cinema, television, radio and internet) as well as creators and heads of multimedia sites operating in the written press and publishing”.

=== Doctorate ===
The École nationale des chartes awards doctorates in the subjects that it teaches. Any student holding a master's degree, whether or not it was awarded by the École des chartes, can apply to enroll in a doctoral program at the school. The doctorate is prepared through two collaborating doctoral schools: the École pratique des hautes études (for doctorates in medieval history, history of art, archeology, Roman philology and Latin) and the Paris Sorbonne University (for doctorates in modern and contemporary history).

=== The Institut national du patrimoine’s ''classe préparatoire intégrée'' ===

Detailed article : [[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)|Institut national du patrimoine (France)]].

The École des chartes provides part of the preparation for the competitive examination for heritage curators (archive specialization) for students of the INP’s ''classe préparatoire intégrée''. These students are selected on the basis of social and academic criteria.

== Research ==
[[File:Buste Quicherat Petit ENC n01.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of [[Jules Quicherat]] by Jean Petit]]
Most of the professors at the École nationale des chartes are affiliated to the Centre Jean-Mabillon, the École’s research unit, whose director is currently [[:fr:Olivier Poncet|Olivier Poncet]].
The aim of the center’s research program to cover all the processes that explain and publicize the written production from the Middle Ages to the present, through various stages : 
* the conditions of production (axis 1: the cultures of writing from the Middle Ages to the 21st century)
* the mechanisms of heritage transmission (axis 2: genesis and tradition of written heritage: author, institutions, laws, study, etc.)
* the conditions of returning of this historic documentation to the scientific community (axis 3: epistemology and the norms of editing texts and images in the digital age)

A significant part of the school’s research activity is the theses of the students, whose fields of studies have diversified over the years and now relate to all periods of history, notably contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;See the thesis abstracts [archive] of recent years, demonstrating the diversity of the research carried out&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
[[File:EScan Digibook scanner ENC.jpg|thumb|A scanner in the library, available for students’ use]]
Partnerships with other institutions form one of the central policies of the current administration, which collaborates closely with the [[École pratique des hautes études]], the [[:fr:Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes|Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes]] and the Centre d’études superieures de civilisation médiévale of the [[University of Poitiers]] to create the École d’Érudition en réseau. The École des chartes is also part of the Institut d’histoire du livre together with the City of Lyon (its municipal library and Museum of printing works), the École normale supérieure of Lyon and the [[:fr:École nationale supérieure des sciences de l'information et des bibliothèques|Enssib]].

The École des chartes also collaborates with other higher education establishments in Paris to form the [[:fr:HeSam Université|ComUE heSam University]], the [[:fr:Sorbonne Universités|ComUE Sorbonne Universities]] and the [[:fr:Campus Condorcet|Campus Condorcet Paris-Aubervilliers]].
 
The school also has partnerships with institutions outside France, such as the Russian State Archives, a number of Moscow libraries, the [[University of Alicante]], and Italian research centers 45. The school takes in a number of foreign students, who are often Swiss, Belgian or from francophone African countries, and is currently seeking to attract new students for shorter stays, through partnerships with universities. The school’s students are also regularly invited to do internships in archives or libraries in other countries.

== The library ==
The library was created by the order of 31 December 1846. At the time it occupied one of the two rooms reserved for the school in the [[hôtel de Soubise]]. The library moved with the school in 1897, and since then has occupied the second floor (reading room and history room), third floor (Horseshoe Room) and fourth floor (offices and store rooms in the attic).

In 1920, the management of the library was taken over by the secretary of the school, who at the time was [[René Poupardin]]. Today it is managed by a library curator.

It was designed as a research library. Its collections are particularly well supplied in the subjects taught at the school: medieval history, philology, history of books, bibliography, etc. The collections (around 150,000 volumes) are all available for immediate access. The catalogue is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.enc.sorbonne.fr/ Catalog of the library of the school]&lt;/ref&gt; Many electronic resources are also available.
 
Due to lack of space at the Sorbonne, the library will move in 2016 to 12 rue des Petits-Champs, into much larger premises.

== Dissemination of knowledge ==

The École nationale des chartes disseminates scientific works in its fields of specialization, in printed and electronic format.  
It has published four collections of works in printed format :
* ''Mémoires et Documents'', a collection dating from 1896, consisting of monographs, most notably the theses of École des chartes alumni
* ''Études et Rencontres'', a collection begun in 1998, principally consisting of the minutes of scientific meetings
* ''Matériaux pour l’Histoire'', a collection inaugurated in 1996, consisting of richly illustrated quarto volumes
* ''Études et documents'' for a Gallia Pontificia, a collection jointly edited by the École nationale des chartes and the German Historical Institute of Paris since 2009 with the aim of presenting the work carried out  as part of the ''Gallia Pontificia'', a scientific enterprise that aims to identify, publish and study the papal acts concerning France dating from before 1198

The École des chartes also publishes two periodic publications relating to the training it offers :
* ''Abstracts of theses'' submitted by students to obtain their qualification of archivist-paleographer, published annually by the École des chartes since 1849. Since 2000, they have also been available online 
* ''Hypotheses''. Works of the University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne doctoral school of history and the École nationale des chartes, co-edited by the École nationale des chartes and Sorbonne publications since 2010
These works are disseminated by CID-FMSH, through the Comptoir des presses de l’université.
Since 2002, the École des chartes has also published scientific works in electronic format in its online collection of publications, the Éditions en ligne de l’École des chartes (ELEC). This gives scientific works digital functions and brings together repertoires and databases as well as texts, in a format that is more suited than printed versions to detailed examination.
This collection is completed by :
* corpora of text made available online for research purposes, unedited by the École des charts
* teaching materials, available on the THELEME website
* a space for presentation of the IT tools and methods developed by the École des chartes
These materials are under open license.

The school develops its scientific and teaching work through several initiatives, including the Thélème website 48, which offers materials supporting the subjects taught at the school, such as educational packs, advice, lessons, and interactive facsimiles.

== École des chartes publications ==
The École des chartes also publishes numerous works, in both paper and electronic format. The ''Mémoires et documents de l’École des chartes'' are monographs, many of them drawn from École des chartes theses or doctoral research. The first of these was published in 1896 and they are distributed by [[Honoré Champion]] and [[Droz]]. Two more collections, the ''Études et rencontres'' (minutes of conventions and brief monographs) and ''Matériaux pour l’histoire'' (illustrated large-format albums), have been created more recently. ELEC is also responsible for the school’s online publications, which include databases, editions of texts, minutes of symposia, bibliographies, and studies.

==The Société de l'École des chartes ==
The Société de l’École des chartes is a registered as a public-interest association which students and alumni can join. Its current president is Marie-Paule Arnauld, who was elected on 29 May 2010, replacing [[:fr:Bernard Barbiche|Bernard Barbiche]]. Twice a year, the Société publishes the ''Bibliothèque de l’École des chartes'' with the support of the École. This scientific review, founded in 1839, is one of the oldest in France.
