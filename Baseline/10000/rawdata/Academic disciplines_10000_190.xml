'''Ascribed characteristics''', as used in the [[social sciences]], refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|last=Ferrante|first=Joan|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|publisher=Cenage|year=|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by "nature" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by "nurture" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), See: [[Nature versus nurture|Nature versus Nurture]].

== Use Within Demography ==

Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different than another by the creation of a country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel|title=Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows Demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of [[Race (human categorization)|Race]], [[Gender]] and [[Ethnicity]]. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are [[Social construction of gender|Social Constructs]], '''ASCRIBED''' to groups or individuals for Stratification &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs|title=Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender roles : a sociological perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda|isbn=9780205899685|edition=Sixth|location=Boston|oclc=892213147|date = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With these [[Theory|theories]] in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products weather perceived or not. Discussed below are Race, Gender, [[Social status|Social Status]] / [[Caste]] and Hiring / Promotion.

=== Race ===
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of [[racism]] can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse and Discrimination: Rhetorics Of Racism and Antisemitism|last=Resigl|first=Martin|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Race does not entirely have a 

=== Gender ===
[https://www.uu.nl/staff/fvantubergen/0 Frank van Tubergen] studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics effect their [[Social capital|Social Capital]] in the article ''Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Tubergen|first=Frank|last2=Al-Modaf|first2=Obaid Ali|last3=Almosaed|first3=Nora F.|last4=Al-Ghamdi|first4=Mohammed Ben Said|title=Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics|journal=Social Networks|volume=45|pages=45–54|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2015.10.007|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in [[Saudi Arabia]] citing specifically that it was "due to fewer non-family connections". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find [[homosexuality]] morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Q|last2=Wilson|first2=G.D|year=2003|title=Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio: evidence for organising effects of sex hormones or developmental instability?|url=|journal=International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=28|pages=288–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sexual orientation]].). Both Groups do however use the term all the same, simply '''ascribing''' different definitions to those individuals.

=== Social Status / Caste ===
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is [[India]], and its [[Caste system in India|Caste System]]. In its essence, it was a system that ascribed sweepers the lowest status, making this one group literally untouchable. Although India officially states that discrimination against lower castes is illegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf][http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf CRIME AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO SCs / STs]'''Government of India, National Crime Records Bureau''' (2011), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Hiring / Promotion ===

[[Ronald P. Dore]] was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese Economy. His view will be expressed here. In his largest work, ''British Factory, Japanese Factory''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British factory, Japanese factory : the origins of national diversity in industrial relations|last=Dore|first=Ronald|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024953|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=20130326}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion, in the Japanese firm Hitachi, over a particular time were based chiefly on "achievement" or chiefly on "ascribed characteristics". The context of the discussion implied that achievement-based decisions are good, while those based on ascribed characteristics are bad. His discussion admits explicitly and, implicitly, that there are several complications to moral judgement that include:

* Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strenze|first=Tarmo|date=2007-09-01|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606001127|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "the power to command...may be much more likely to be bred in upper class families" to the extent that "the power to command" is viewed as a measure of merit. Promotion decisions favoring high merit would not be entirely distinguishable from making promotion decisions favoring high class thus, it can be difficult, to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons.
* It is possible to, "irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics", or even do so intentionally. For example, by converting to a new religion or getting married. 
* It is reasonable to view even some ascribed characteristics as factors that should affect employee compensation. In Hitachi, for example, pay is positively correlated both with performance and with age. The latter is an ascribed characteristic, but Dore suggests that it is a perfectly reasonable consideration, especially since expenses such as childcare, tend to increase over the duration of employment at Hitachi.

Dore also points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards, he viewed an applicant's success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. Thus, he noted that hiring decisions at Hitachi, during the time of his study, were "regulated by very strict qualification standards" and not very significantly influenced by ascribed characteristics. When he turned to evaluate opportunities for advancement within the firm, however, Dore noted that "educational qualifications...limit the range of posts which one can achieve". Meaning even if one's level of achievement increases, one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. Therefore, in investigating opportunities for promotions, educational achievement " the two become another form of ascribed characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hearn|first=James C.|title=Attendance at higher-cost colleges: Ascribed, socioeconomic, and academic influences on student enrollment patterns|journal=Economics of Education Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–76|doi=10.1016/0272-7757(88)90072-6|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications.

An '''assault course''' (also called '''trim trail''') is a special sort of [[trail]] that combines [[running]] and [[Physical exercise|exercising]]. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} It is heavily used in [[military training]]. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

==Military training==
Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.

==Trim trail==
The term "trim trail" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loughgallcountrypark.co.uk/?page=cycling&amp;sub=17 |title=Welcome to Loughall Country Park |publisher=Loughall Country Park |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/6645 |title=Trim trail exercise stations |publisher=Bristol City Council |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the trim trail at [[Hollingworth Lake]], in [[Greater Manchester]], which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the [[Big Lottery Fund|Big Lottery]] Community Spaces fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |title=Woodland Wonder opens for all |publisher=Groundwork Oldham and Rochdale |date=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114711/http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astral rays, composed of [[microtubules]], radiate from the centrosphere and look like a cloud. It is one of the variants of microtubules like [[kinetochore]] and interpolar microtubules.

During mitosis, there are four stages of cell division: [[Prophase]], [[Metaphase]], [[Anaphase]], and [[Telophase]]. During prophase, two aster-covered centrosomes migrate to opposite sides of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] in preparation of mitotic spindle formation. During metaphase, the kinetochore microtubules connect to the [[centromere]]. Afterwards, during anaphase, the kinetochore microtubules pull the chromatids apart into its individual [[chromosomes]] and pull them towards the centrosomes, located at opposite ends of the cell. This allows the cell to divide properly with each daughter cell containing full replicas of chromosomes. In some cells, the positions of the asters determine the site of cell divisions.

The '''Autonomous University of Chihuahua''' (in {{lang-es|'''Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, UACH'''}}) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[public university]] based in the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], but with several campuses across the state. In December 8, 1954 the State Legislature, with Governor [[Oscar Soto Maynez]], issued the decree 171, which founded the Autonomous University of Chihuahua (UACh).
UACh was granted its autonomy in 1968, with the freedom to define its own curriculum and manage its own budget without interference from the government.

==History==
The '''Literary and Scientific Institute of Chihuahua''' was founded on March 19, 1835. In order to promote cultural development in the emerging city of Chihuahua, it offered to the community studies of Latin and Spanish grammar. In the beginning there were 21 students, and between the years 1835 and 1900 around 996 people received education in its classrooms.

The demand for education in the state grew, so that many students had to leave the entity to Mexico City for their studies.  Many of them stayed in that city, and for that reason the State lost many important personalities.

The building occupied by the Literary and Scientific Institute is now employed as the Rectory of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua (UACh).

===Creation of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua===

Because of the demand of the school population for open spaces sufficient for education, the State Legislature, with Governor of Oscar Soto Maynez, issued the decree 171,   which founded the Autonomous University of Chihuahua (UACh) on December 8, 1954.

In its early years the school served a population of barely a thousand in each school year's enrollment. At that time Mexico's total population stood at only 26 million people, with three quarters of a million in Chihuahua. Back then, Mexico's total enrollment in higher education was 29,000 students.

UACH began with schools of Medicine, Engineering, Law, Physical Education and Pharmacy.

In September 1956 the ranching school was founded, which is the Faculty of Animal Science today.

The School of Accounting and Administration, for which the precedent was the School of Business Brokers, was created on December 3, 1958, as the School of Commerce and Administration. Today this is the School of Accounting and Administration.

The Central Library was founded with 2 000 353 volumes in 1960. That same year, a quartet was created which became the UACH symphony orchestra of today.

The School of Philosophy, Literature and Journalism was founded in July, 1963.  This is now the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature.

The university founded the School of Agronomy on July 22, 1967. This was later moved to [[Delicias, Chihuahua|Delicias]], as it was the largest agricultural city. Today, this has become the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry.  Chihuahua has more forests than any other state of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prevencion de Incendios Forestales en Chihuahua. |url=http://www.eduteka.org/proyectos.php/1/2356 |publisher=Eduteka |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 it acquired its autonomy and became the Autonomous University of Chihuahua.

The School of Public Administration and Political Science, located in [[Ciudad Juarez]], was born in 1968. Today this is the Faculty of Political and Social Science.

A fruit farm engineering school began, creating the school of fruit engineering in 1974. This became independent from the School of Chemistry and rose to the rank of a Faculty in 1985.

The Department of Fine Arts, later the Institute, and today the Faculty of Arts, was born with the university. The School of Nursing and Obstetrics was raised to a degree college and soon became a separate faculty in 1976.

The construction of the university gym began May 12, 1978, and opened on October 2, 1980.  The architectural work was accomplished entirely by UACH engineering graduates.

The School of Dentistry was created in the  city of Chihuahua in 1991, and  the School of International Economics was located in the city of Hidalgo del Parral the same year.

The current campus has an area of 25 hectares, which originally formed part of an area of 107 hectares donated by Elias Brothers to the State Government, in order to build a sports and recreation park in memory of their mother, Mrs. Emilia M. de Elías. These lands are now occupied by the University, the Sports City, Chihuahua Institute of Technology, the School Carmen Romano de Lopez Portillo, the School of Special Education and the former Pemex storage facility.&lt;ref name="uach_history"&gt;http://www.uach.mx/institucional_y_juridica/2008/03/07/historia/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9982">'''Bayesian experimental design''' provides a general probability-theoretical framework from which other theories on [[Design of experiments|experimental design]] can be derived. It is based on [[Bayesian inference]] to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.

The theory of Bayesian experimental design is to a certain extent based on the theory for making [[optimal decision|optimal decisions under uncertainty]]. The aim when designing an experiment is to  maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. The utility is most commonly defined in terms of a measure of the accuracy of the information provided by the experiment (e.g. the [[Shannon information]] or the negative [[variance]]), but may also involve factors such as the financial cost of performing the experiment. What will be the optimal experiment design depends on the particular utility criterion chosen.

==Relations to more specialized optimal design theory==

===Linear theory===
If the model is linear, the prior [[probability density function]] (PDF) is homogeneous and observational errors are [[Multivariate normal distribution|normally distributed]], the theory simplifies to the classical [[optimal design|optimal experimental design theory]].

===Approximate normality===
In numerous publications on Bayesian experimental design, it is (often implicitly) assumed that all posterior PDFs will be approximately normal. This allows for the expected utility to be calculated using linear theory, averaging over the space of model parameters, an approach reviewed in {{Harvtxt|Chaloner|Verdinelli|1995}}. Caution must however be taken when applying this method, since approximate normality of all possible posteriors is difficult to verify, even in cases of normal observational errors and uniform prior PDF.

===Posterior distribution===
Recently, increased computational resources allow inference of the [[posterior distribution]] of model parameters, which can directly be used for experiment design. {{Harvtxt|Vanlier|Tiemann|Hilbers|van Riel|2012}} proposed an approach that uses the [[posterior predictive distribution]] to assess the effect of new measurements on prediction uncertainty, while {{Harvtxt|Liepe|Filippi|Komorowski|Stumpf|2013}} suggest maximizing the mutual information between parameters, predictions and potential new experiments.

Given a vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of parameters to determine, a [[Prior probability|prior PDF]] &lt;math&gt;p(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; over those parameters and a PDF &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\theta,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; for making observation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, given parameter values &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and an experiment design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, the posterior PDF can be calculated using [[Bayes' theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y, \xi) = \frac{p(y \mid \theta, \xi) p(\theta)}{p(y \mid \xi)}  \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is the marginal probability density in observation space
:&lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\xi) = \int p(\theta)p(y\mid\theta,\xi)\,d\theta \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The expected utility of an experiment with design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; can then be defined
:&lt;math&gt;U(\xi)=\int p(y\mid\xi)U(y,\xi)\,dy,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U(y,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is some real-valued functional of the [[Posterior probability|posterior PDF]] &lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y, \xi)&lt;/math&gt; after making observation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; using an experiment design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gain in Shannon information as utility===

Utility may be defined as the prior-posterior gain in [[Differential entropy|Shannon information]]
:&lt;math&gt; U(y, \xi) = \int \log(p(\theta \mid y, \xi))\,p(\theta | y, \xi) \, d\theta - \int \log(p(\theta))\,p(\theta)\,d\theta \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Another possibility is to define the utility as
:&lt;math&gt;U(y, \xi) = D_{KL}(p(\theta\mid y,\xi) \| p(\theta)) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] of the prior from the posterior distribution.
{{Harvtxt|Lindley|1956}} noted that the expected utility will then be coordinate-independent and can be written in two forms
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
 U(\xi) &amp; = \int \int \log(p(\theta \mid y,\xi))\,p(\theta, y \mid \xi) \, d\theta\,dy - \int\log(p(\theta))\,p(\theta) \, d\theta \\
      &amp; = \int \int \log(p(y \mid \theta,\xi))\,p(\theta, y \mid \xi)\,dy\,d\theta - \int\log(p(y \mid \xi))\,p(y\mid \xi) \, dy,
\end{alignat}
\, &lt;/math&gt;

of which the latter can be evaluated without the need for evaluating individual posterior PDFs
&lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; for all possible observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the first term on the second equation line will not depend on the design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, as long as the observational uncertainty doesn't. On the other hand, the integral of &lt;math&gt;p(\theta) \log p(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in the first form is constant for all &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, so if the goal is to choose the design with the highest utility, the term need not be computed at all. Several authors have considered numerical techniques for evaluating and optimizing this criterion, e.g. {{Harvtxt|van den Berg|Curtis|Trampert|2003}} and {{Harvtxt|Ryan|2003}}.  Note that
:&lt;math&gt;U(\xi) = I(\theta;y)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
the expected '''information gain''' being exactly the '''[[mutual information]]'''  between the parameter ''θ'' and the observation ''y''.  {{Harvtxt|Kelly|1956}} also derived just such a utility function for a gambler seeking to [[Kelly criterion|profit maximally]] from [[Gambling and information theory|side information in a horse race]]; Kelly's situation is identical to the foregoing, with the side information, or "private wire" taking the place of the experiment.

The most common technology and alternate fuel available in the market for bi-fuel gasoline cars is [[Liquefied petroleum gas|Autogas (LPG)]], followed by [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html | title=Natural Gas Vehicles | author=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center | publisher=US Department of Energy | date= | accessdate=2008-09-01 |language= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901201306/http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used mainly in Europe. The Netherlands and the Baltic states have a large number of cars running with LPG. [[Italy]] currently has the largest number of CNG vehicles, followed by Sweden.  They are also used in [[South America]], where these vehicles are mainly used as [[taxicab]]s in main cities of [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the [[gas cylinder]] in the trunk and the LPG or CNG injection system and electronics.

==Diesel conversions==
Diesel engine is compression ignition engine and does not have spark plug. To operate a diesel engine with an alternate combustible fuel source such as [[Natural gas]], '''Dual-Fuel''' system used. Natural gas as the main fuel while [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuel is used for the ignition of the gas/air mixture inside the cylinder (a portion of diesel is injected at the end of the compression stroke, thereby maintaining the original diesel operation principle)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/8473/|title=Conversion method of a diesel engine to a CNG-diesel dual fuel engine and its financial savings|last=Mukhsin|first=Ismail, Muammar|last2=Hakim|first2=Zulkifli, Abd Fathul|date=April 2016|website=eprints.uthm.edu.my|access-date=2018-08-20|last3=Fawzi|first3=Mohd Ali, Mas|last4=Azmir|first4=Osman, Shahrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual fuel operation means the engine uses two fuels (gas and diesel)  at the same time, as opposed to Bi Fuel which would mean the engine could have the option of using either fuel separately.

There usually two type of conversions - low speed (below 1000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and high speed (between 1200 and 1800 RPM).

[[Image:Low speed conversion.jpg|thumb|Low Speed Conversion]]

===Low and middle speed conversion===
Gas is injected into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed as close to the suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines – within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.

* This conversion is adjusted for low speed engines up to 1000 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 70-90% natural gas for diesel or HFO.
* Gas is injected directly before intake valve by high speed electromagnetic injector, one or two injector per each cylinder.

=== High speed conversion===
[[Image:High speed conversion.jpg|thumb|High Speed Conversion]]

Gas is mixed with air by a common mixer installed before turbocharger(s). Gas flow is controlled by a throttle valve, which is electronically operated by the special control system according to the required engine output and speed. In order to avoid knocking of the engine, knocking detector/controller is installed, thus enabling engine operation at the most efficient gas/diesel ratio.

* Suitable for all High Speed engines, 1200-1800 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 50-80% natural gas for diesel.
* Gas and air are blended behind air filter before turbocharger by central mixer.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRwH9BF0h1w&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common conversion features==
{{prose|section|date=March 2017}}
* Substantial savings on operation costs
* Practically no engine modification required
* Non-derated output power
* Fuel flexibility: Possibility of bi-fuel or original pure diesel operations
* Safe operations.
* Lower emissions
* Longer engine life span, longer service and maintenance intervals

==Gas types used==
It is common to use [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG (Liquid Natural Gas)]] for bi-fuel operations. Both are also mostly used for [[Electrical generator|Generator sets]] conversions, because the engine does not lose the output power.

In recent years [[biogas]] is being used. The [[biogas]] composition and calorific value must be known in order to evaluate if the particular biogas type is suitable. Calorific value may be an issue as biogas is derived from different sources and there is low calorific value in many cases. You can imagine you have to inject sufficient volume of gas into the cylinder to substitute [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil (or, better to say, substitute energy delivered by diesel oil). If the calorific value (energy) of the biogas was very low, there is a need to inject really big volume of biogas into the cylinder, which might be technically impossible. Additionally, the composition of the biogas has to lean towards ignitable gases and be filtered as much as possible of non-combustible compounds such as carbon dioxide.

Associated gas is the last type of gas which is commonly used for bi-fuel conversions of generator sets. Associated gas is a natural gas found in association with oil, either dissolved in the oil or as a cap of free gas above the oil. It means it has almost the same quality as CNG or LNG.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/halliburton-leads-effort-_n_3342119.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diesel/gas ratio==
It depends on the technical state of the engine, especially of the injection system. The typical Diesel / Gas ratio is 40/60% for the high-speed engines. If the operating output of the engine is constant and between 70-80% of nominal output, than it is possible to reach up to 30/70% ratio.&lt;ref&gt;http://hhpinsight.com/epoperations/2013/02/cummins-for-pge-universal-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt; If the operating output is lower (for example 50% of the nominal output) or if there are variations, the rate is about 45/55% (more of diesel is used).For Low Speed conversions it is possible to reach the Diesel/gas ratio up to 10/90%. Generally, it is not possible to guarantee an exact diesel/gas ratio without a test being done after the conversion.

== Vehicles ==

The '''Black Order''' or '''The Black Order of Pan Europa''' are a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] group formerly based in New Zealand. Political scientists [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] and Leonard Weinberg characterised the Black Order as a "[[Nazism|National Socialist]]-oriented Satanist mail order ministry".{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} However, in 1995, the anti-fascist [[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] organization, following an investigation, described it as part of a functioning international Occult-Fascist Axis.&lt;ref&gt;''David Myatt and the Occult-Fascist Axis'', Searchlight,  July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Black Order was founded in New Zealand by [[Kerry Bolton]] as a successor to his Order of the Left Hand Path.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Bolton had connections to other neo-Nazi Satanist groups, being the international distributor for the English-based [[Order of Nine Angles]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=229}}

According to Goodrick-Clarke, "in 1994 Bolton set up the Black Order, which claimed a global network of national lodges in Britain, France, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Germany, the United States and Australia, dedicated to fostering National Socialism, fascism, satanism, paganism and other aspects of the European Darkside".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=227}} Its quarterly membership bulletin ''The Flaming Sword'' and its successor [[zine]] ''The Nexus'' contained interviews with, among others, [[James Mason (neo-Nazi)|James Mason]], [[George Burdi|George Eric Hawthorne]], Michael Moynihan, [[David Myatt]] and [[Miguel Serrano]], and its articles included studies of Thulianism, Himmler's [[Wewelsburg]], tributes to old SS leaders, "a reprint of the ONA Mass of Heresy [and] contributions from David Myatt on the galactic empire, aeonic strategy and the cosmological magic of National Socialism".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=227-228}}

In 1996, a U.S. branch of the Black Order was established.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} In summer that year, they began publication of a magazine, ''Abyss''.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}} The U.S. group subsequently fell out with that in New Zealand over the latter's acceptance of homosexual members.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}} The U.S. group considered a name change to the White Order as a result of this schism.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=219}}

The name "Black Order" was then adopted by ideologically similar groups around the world which had no formal connection to Bolton's group.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Kaplan and Weinberg described the Black Order as "a remarkably influential purveyor of National Socialist-oriented occultism throughout the world".{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=144}}

In 2016 former members of The Black Order re-established the group with lodges in Australia, England, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theblackorder.org/index2.html|title=.:THE BLACK ORDER of Pan Europa:.|website=www.theblackorder.org|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Health Archive===
'''''Global Health Archive''''' is a searchable database produced by CABI. It is created from 800,000 records, from six printed abstract journals,  which are collected published scientific research from 1910 to 1972, digitized to form the archive. Global Health Archive is also  indexed in other databases, which also serve as access points. These other databases are ''CAB Direct'', [[Web of Knowledge]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Ovid Technologies|OvidSP]], and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]].&lt;ref name=ghArchive/&gt;

When combined with the ''Global Health'' database indexing coverage can be from 1910 to present day. Hence, coverage is made up of past [[epidemics]], from rates and patterns of disease [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], duration of [[pandemics]], timing of epidemiological peaks, [[geographic distribution]] of diseases, and [[World Health Organization|government preparedness]] and [[quarantine]] provisions.  The following can also be taken  into account:  effects on different age and [[social groups]], severity in developing vs. developed countries, [[symptoms]], causes of [[Human|mortality]] - such as secondary problems like [[pneumonia]] - and mortality rates.&lt;ref name=ghArchive&gt;{{cite web

'''Thy-1''' or '''CD90''' ('''C'''luster of '''D'''ifferentiation '''90''') is a 25–37 k[[Atomic mass unit|Da]] heavily N-glycosylated, [[glycophosphatidylinositol]] (GPI) anchored conserved cell surface [[protein]] with a single V-like [[immunoglobulin domain]], originally discovered as a [[thymocyte]] antigen. Thy-1 can be used as a marker for a variety of [[stem cell]]s and for the [[axon|axonal processes]] of mature [[neuron]]s. Structural study of Thy-1 led to the foundation of the [[Immunoglobulin superfamily]], of which it is the smallest member, and led to some of the initial biochemical description and characterization of a vertebrate GPI anchor and also the first demonstration of tissue specific differential glycosylation.

== Discovery and nomenclature ==

The antigen Thy-1 was the first T cell marker  to be identified. Thy-1 was discovered  by Reif and Allen in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reif AE, Allen JM | title = The AKR thymic antigen and its distribution in leukemias and nervous tissue | journal = J. Exp. Med. | volume = 120 | pages = 413–433 | year = 1964 | doi = 10.1084/jem.120.3.413 | pmid = 14207060 | pmc = 2137766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a search for heterologous antisera against mouse [[leukemia]] cells, and was demonstrated by them to be present on murine thymocytes, on T lymphocytes, and on neuronal cells.  It was originally named theta (θ) antigen, then Thy-1 ('''THYmocyte differentiation antigen 1''') due to its prior identification in thymocytes (precursors of [[T cell]]s in the [[thymus]]). The human homolog was isolated in 1980 as a 25kDa protein (p25) of T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-3 binding with anti-monkey-thymocyte antisera.&lt;ref name="pmid6153212"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ades EW, Zwerner RK, Acton RT, Balch CM | title = Isolation and partial characterization of the human homologue of Thy-1 | journal = J. Exp. Med. | volume = 151 | issue = 2 | pages = 400–6 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6153212 | doi = 10.1084/jem.151.2.400 | pmc = 2185777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of Thy-1 in mice and humans led to the subsequent discovery of many other T cell markers, which is very significant to the field of [[immunology]] since T cells (along with B cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid6153212" /&gt;

== The conserved gene and its alleles ==
Thy-1 has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and even in some invertebrates, with [[homology (biology)|homologs]] described in many species like [[squid]], [[frog]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[human]]s.

The Thy-1 gene is located at human [[chromosome 11]]q22.3 (mouse chromosome 9qA5.1). In [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;term=thy1&amp;submit=Go AceView], it covers 6.82 kb, from 119294854 to 119288036 (NCBI 37, August 2010), on the reverse strand. This locus is very close to [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] &amp; CD56/[[Neural cell adhesion molecule|NCAM]] genes. Some believe that there may be a functional significance of both this gene and CD3 delta subunit (T3D) mapping to chromosome 11q in man and chromosome 9 in mouse, though there is no homology (in fact this speculation lead to its localization in chromosome 11q - the human chromosome region syntenic to mouse chromosome 9 which harbored T3D). In mice, there are two [[allele]]s: Thy1.1 (Thy 1a, CD90.1) and Thy1.2 (Thy 1b, CD90.2). They differ by only one [[amino acid]] at position 108; an arginine in Thy-1.1 and a glutamine in Thy-1.2. Thy 1.2 is expressed by most strains of mice, whereas Thy1.1 is expressed by some like AKR/J and PL [[Mouse#Taxonomy of the genus Mus|mouse strain]]s.

==The Protein==
The 25-kDa core protein (excluding the heavy glycosylation) of rodent Thy-1 is 111 or 112 amino acids in length, and is N-glycosylated at three sites (In contrast to only two glycosylation sites for human Thy-1). The 162aa (murine, 161 for human) Thy1 precursor has 19 amino acid (aa 1-19) [[signal peptide|signal sequence]] and 31 amino acid (aa 132-162) C-terminal transmembrane domain that is present in pro form but removed when transferring the 112 amino acid (aa 20-131) mature peptide to GPI anchor which would attach through the aa 131.

Some of the common monoclonal [[antibody|antibodies]] used to detect this protein are clones OX7, 5E10, K117 and L127.
There have been some reports of Thy1 monoclonal antibodies cross reacting with some cytoskeletal elements: anti Thy-1.2 with [[actin]] in marsupial, murine, and human cells and anti Thy-1.1 with [[vimentin]], and were suggested to be due to sequence homology by studies done more than 20 years back.&lt;ref name="pmid6136544"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dales S, Fujinami RS, Oldstone MB | title = Serologic relatedness between Thy-1.2 and actin revealed by monoclonal antibody | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 1332–8 |date=September 1983 | pmid = 6136544 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thy-1, like many other GPI anchored proteins can be shed by special types of [[Phospholipase C]] e.g. PI-PLC (phosphatidyl-Inositol Phospholipase C, or PLC β). it can also be involved in cell to cell transfer of GPI anchored proteins like [[CD55]] and [[CD59]].

==Glycosylation==
Thy-1 is one of the most heavily glycosylated membrane proteins with a carbohydrate content up to 30% of its molecular mass.&lt;ref name="pmid2888493"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pont S | title = Thy-1: a lymphoid cell subset marker capable of delivering an activation signal to mouse T lymphocytes | journal = Biochimie | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–20 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2888493 | doi = 10.1016/0300-9084(87)90022-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy1 in most species has 3 N-glycosylation sites (Asn 23, 74 and 98) but no O-glycosylation. The composition of Thy-1 carbohydrate moieties varies considerably between different tissues or even among cells of the same lineage at different stages of differentiation: e.g., galactosamine only in brain Thy-1, sialic acid in thymic Thy-1 in far excess than brain Thy-1, that too increasing in parallel with T cell maturation. In this regard it has yet another historic association: Thy1 happens to be the first glycoprotein in which cell type specificity of variant glycosylation on an invariant protein was demonstrated. Analysis of Differencial glycosylation  of Thy-1  from  brain  and  thymus showed that all the  complex  N-linked  structures  differed between  the  two  forms, superimposed  upon  a  site specific  common core. In case of Thy1 this core pattern was constituted by  Asn23  carrying mostly  oligomannose  structures,  Asn74 carrying the  most  extended  complex  structures,  and  Asn98  carrying  smaller  complex structure. The structure of the sugar residues in the GPI anchor and their associated esterified structures (e.g. additional fatty acids and alcohols) also can be cell type and species specific.

==Expression==
Thy1 expression varies between species. Amongst the cells reported to generally express Thy-1 are [[thymocytes]] (precursor of T cells in the [[thymus]]) &amp; [[CD34]](+) prothymocytes; [[neuron]]s, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], [[hematopoietic stem cells]], [[NK cell]]s, murine [[T-cell]]s, [[endothelium]] (mainly in [[high endothelial venule]]s or HEVs where diapedesis takes place), renal [[glomerulus|glomerular]] [[mesangial cell]]s, circulating metastatic [[melanoma]] cells, [[follicular dendritic cell]]s (FDC), a fraction of [[fibroblast]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s.

===Detailed expression of Thy-1===
* In mice, Thy-1 is also found on thymocytes, peripheral T cells, myoblasts, epidermal cells, and keratinocytes. It is one of the '''"pan T cell markers"'''(of mice) like [[CD2]], [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]] and [[CD28]].
* In humans, Thy-1 is also expressed by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, a subset of CD34+ bone marrow cells, and umbilical cord blood-, cardiac fibroblasts, and fetal liver-derived hemopoietic cells.
* Thy-1 is present on a fraction of brain cells and a fraction of [[fibroblast]]s of most vertebrate species studied.
* '''Nervous tissue''': Thy-1 expression in the nervous system is predominantly neuronal, but some glial cells also express Thy-1 especially at later stages of their differentiation. One study compared Thy-1 expression in four human neuronal cell lines, two neuroglial cell lines, and fresh tumor cells of neuronal origin and found three of the four neuronal cell lines, all of the neuroglial cell lines, and 80% of the tumors to be strongly positive for Thy-1.&lt;ref name="pmid6121610"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kemshead JT, Ritter MA, Cotmore SF, Greaves MF | title = Human Thy-1: expression on the cell surface of neuronal and glial cells | journal = Brain Res. | volume = 236 | issue = 2 | pages = 451–61 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6121610 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(82)90727-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain part specific ELISA reports are available which show highest concentrations of Thy1 protein in the [[striatum]] and [[hippocampus]], followed by the [[neocortex]], [[cerebellum]], [[spinal cord]], and the [[retina]] and [[optic nerve]]. Thy1 promoter has often been assumed to be "brain specific". "Neuron specific" mouse thy1 promoter has been used to drive "brain specific" forced expression of proteins e.g. mutated [[Amyloid precursor protein]](APP) as transgenic animal models of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid10037741"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moechars D, Dewachter I, Lorent K, Reversé D, Baekelandt V, Naidu A, Tesseur I, Spittaels K, Haute CV, Checler F, Godaux E, Cordell B, Van Leuven F | title = Early phenotypic changes in transgenic mice that overexpress different mutants of amyloid precursor protein in brain | journal = J.

Thy-1 levels in the neonatal rat brain, as well as the developing human brain, are low compared to adult brain. During the first few weeks of postnatal development, Thy-1 levels increase exponentially as the brain matures.
*'''Lymphoid tissue''' Thy-1 expression is highly variable between species. In humans, Thy-1 expression is restricted to only a small population of cortical thymocytes&lt;ref name="pmid7462633"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKenzie JL, Fabre JW | title = Human thy-1: unusual localization and possible functional significance in lymphoid tissues | journal = J.

The third intron of the mouse Thy-1 gene has a 36 base pair region that recruits nuclear transcription factors, such as Ets-1-like NF, expressed in thymocytes and splenocytes. The homologous region of the rat gene lacks the Ets-1-like NF binding site, but instead binds another NF expressed in rat thymocytes but not splenocytes.

===Induction of Thy-1 expression===
*Agents shown to induce Thy1 expression include: [[Thymopoietin]], [[thymosin]], [[prostaglandins]], [[nerve growth factor]], [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]], [[Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate|PMA]], Ca2+ ionophore, and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG).&lt;ref name="pmid15356100"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haeryfar SM, Hoskin DW | title = Thy-1: more than a mouse pan-T cell marker | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 173 | issue = 6 | pages = 3581–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15356100 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3581| url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/173/6/3581 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localization==
As a [[Glycophosphatidylinositol|GPI-anchored protein]], Thy-1 is present in the outer leaflet of [[lipid raft]]s in the cell membrane. In case of [[neuron]]s it is known to be expressed strongly in the mature axon. The [[axon hillock]] can act as a barrier for its lateral spread even though it has no transmembrane segment. Thy-1 has been suggested to interact with G inhibitory proteins, the Src family kinase (SFK) member c-fyn, and tubulin within lipid rafts. In rats and mice, Thy-1 protein is present on the soma (cell body) and dendrites of neurons but is not expressed on axons until axonal growth is complete, and is again temporarily suppressed during axonal injury. [[HIV-1]] Matrix co-localizes with Thy-1 in lipid rafts, the site of virus particle budding from cells, and Thy-1 is incorporated into virus particles as a result of this process.

==Function==
The function of Thy-1 has not yet been fully elucidated. It has  speculated roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, with implication in neurite outgrowth, nerve regeneration, [[apoptosis]], [[metastasis]], [[inflammation]], and [[fibrosis]].

===Role in cognition===
The Thy-1 knockout (KO) mice are viable and appear grossly normal. They display normal social interactions and normal learning in a maze, but fail to learn from social cues (e.g. learning from other mice which foods are safe to eat as compared to wild-type mice). This failure can be rescued by the transgenic expression of Thy-1 or pharmacologic treatment with a GABA (A) receptor antagonists. This suggests that Thy-1 KO mice have excessive GABAergic inhibition in the dentate gyrus and regional inhibition of long-term potentiation.

===Axon growth regulation===
Crosslinking anti-Thy-1 Ab can promote neurite outgrowth which is dependent on G{alpha}i and L- and N-type calcium channel activation. The ligand for promotion of neurite outgrowth on astrocytes is not yet identified, but the inhibitory ligand has been suggested to be integrins. Thy1 is one of the known ligands of beta 3 [[integrin]]s. Interaction of thy1 expressed on maturing [[axon]]s with beta 3 integrins expressed on mature astrocytes may be the cause of halting of axon growth.

===T-cell activation===
Crosslinking Thy-1 molecules in the membrane raft, in the context of strong costimulatory signaling through CD28 in mouse T cells can act to some extent as a substitute activating signal for T-cell receptor signaling. Conversely it can substitute CD28 costimulation for activation through the TCR.&lt;ref name="pmid15356100"/&gt;

===Apoptosis/Necrosis===
Cross linking antibody induced aggregation of Thy1 cause death of thymocytes and mesangial cells mainly by [[apoptosis]] despite Bcl2 upregulation. The death of mesangial cells seems to be apoptosis by TUNEL staining or annexin V staining, but electron microscopy suggest it is [[necrosis]].

====Antibody target for animal model of Glomerulonephritis====
Single tail vein intravenous injection of antibody (OX7 mouse [[monoclonal]] IgG) against Thy1.1 in rats is used as a standard animal model to produce experimental mesangioproliferative [[glomerulonephritis]]&lt;ref name="pmid2892961"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto T, Wilson CB | title = Quantitative and qualitative studies of antibody-induced mesangial cell damage in the rat | journal = Kidney Int. | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 514–25 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2892961 | doi = 10.1038/ki.1987.240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is popularly known in the field of [[nephrology]] as ''antiThy1 GN''.

===Tumor suppression===
It has also been proven to be a [[tumor suppressor]] for some tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid12781446"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abeysinghe HR, Cao Q, Xu J, Pollock S, Veyberman Y, Guckert NL, Keng P, Wang N | title = THY1 expression is associated with tumor suppression of human ovarian cancer | journal = Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. | volume = 143 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–32 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12781446 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-4608(02)00855-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably is aided by its action in upregulating [[thrombospondin]], SPARC ([[osteonectin]]), and [[fibronectin]]. However it has also been speculated to aid in extravasation in circulating melanoma cells. In case of prostate cancer it has been shown to be expressed in cancer associated stroma but not in normal stroma and has been suggested to be of potential help for cancer specific drug targeting [http://www3.niddk.nih.gov/fund/other/cellularniche/poster%20abstracts/True%20Abstract%20ormatted.pdf].

===Role in cell adhesion, extravasation, migration===
Acting through several integrins and probably a few yet unknown other receptors Thy-1 mediates adhesion of leukocytes and monocytes to endothelial cells and fibroblasts, melanoma cells to endothelium, and thymocytes to thymic epithelium.&lt;ref name="pmid16770003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rege TA, Hagood JS | title = Thy-1 as a regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in axon regeneration, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, cancer, and fibrosis | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1045–54 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16770003 | doi = 10.1096/fj.05-5460rev }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy1 expression comes on when endothelial cells are activated. It has been shown to interact with the leukocyte integrin Mac1 (CD11b/CD18) and may play a role in leukocyte homing and recruitment.&lt;ref name="pmid15004192"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wetzel A, Chavakis T, Preissner KT, Sticherling M, Haustein UF, Anderegg U, Saalbach A | title = Human Thy-1 (CD90) on activated endothelial cells is a counterreceptor for the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 172 | issue = 6 | pages = 3850–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15004192 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3850| url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/172/6/3850 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modulating fibrosis===
Role of Thy-1 in fibrosis and fibroblast differention may have some tissue variation. In lung fibrosis Thy-1 level is suppressed in stimulated fibroblasts. Thy1 knock out mice have increased fibrosis in the lung. Fibrosis induced by radiation mimicking chemotherapeutic agent [[Bleomycin]] is also increased in these mice.

==Other roles==
Thy-1 knock out mice also show impaired cutaneous immune responses and abnormal retinal development: thinning of the inner nuclear, inner plexiform, ganglion cell, and outer segment layers of the retina.

==Use in stem cell biology==
Thy-1 can be considered as a surrogate marker for various kind of [[stem cell]]s (e.g. [[hematopoietic stem cells]] or HSCs). It is one of the popular combinatorial surface markers for [[Fluorescent-activated cell sorting|FACS]] for stem cells in combination with other markers like [[CD34]]. In humans, Thy-1 is expressed on neurons and HSCs among others. It is considered a major marker of HSC pluripotency in concordance with CD34. In human HSCs, Thy1 cells are all CD34 positive.&lt;ref name="pmid20688981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boitano AE, Wang J, Romeo R, Bouchez LC, Parker AE, Sutton SE, Walker JR, Flaveny CA, Perdew GH, Denison MS, Schultz PG, Cooke MP | title = Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Antagonists Promote the Expansion of Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1345–8 |date=September 2010 | pmid = 20688981 | doi = 10.1126/science.1191536 | pmc = 3033342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7683034"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig W, Kay R, Cutler RL, Lansdorp PM | title = Expression of Thy-1 on human hematopoietic progenitor cells | journal = J.

'''Cazaux Air Base''' ({{lang-fr|Base aérienne 120 Cazaux}}) {{airport codes||LFBC}} is a [[French Air Force]] ({{lang-fr|'''Armée de l'Air'''}}) base.  The base is located in the village of Cazaux, part of the town of [[La Teste-de-Buch]], and is approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bordeaux]].

==Overview==
The air base was created at the behest of Commandant Marzac. The site did not take the name of BA 120 until 1962, becoming the largest air base in France one hundred years after it was founded. The base is used mainly for training and integration of French fighter pilots and gunnery training over the [[Bay of Biscay]].

The Franco-Belgian [[Alphajet]] aerial fighter school is based at Cazaux. It is responsible for training future fighter pilots of the two nations.

Since 1998, the base has hosted the No. 150 Squadron of the Republic of Singapore Air Force, equipped with [[ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk]]s, and since 15 November 2012, with [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master|Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]]s to train pilots before assigning Singaporeans to operational [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C/D Fighting Falcon]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15SG Strike Eagle]] units. {{As of|March 2010}}, 120 pilots had been trained at the base.

Approximately 2,600 military and civilian personnel work on the base.

==Units assigned==
* The operational transition Squadron 1/8 "Saintonge" on [[Alphajet]]. Based in Cazaux since 1964.
* The operational transition Squadron AJeTS 2/8 "Nice" on Alphajet. Based in Cazaux since 1964.
* The Helicopter Squadron 1/67 "Pyrenees" on Puma and [[EC725]] Caracal . Based in Cazaux since 1972.
* The Centre of Expertise in Embedded Arm (00 331 SEAC) which since 1 September 2009 replaces Experimentation Center and Shooting Instruction in Air (Ceita), which forms each year 200-250 French and foreign trainees
* Group Instruction Flight Safety (GISV) of the National Gendarmerie from 1 September 2010.
* A DGA test site in Flight (Formerly CEV Cazaux).
* Technicians Training Center Safety of Air Force (CFTSAA) 00/308
* No. 150 Squadron of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]].

==History==

The airfield was created in 1914 in order to train French and Allied military pilots (fighters and bombers) and still exists as Base Aérienne 120 "Commandant Marzac".

Most of the American volunteer pilots of the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] came to the Cazaux camp to achieve their training as war pilots.

When the U.S. entered the war, the AEF (American Expeditionary Force) had several units based here, including the [[36th Aero Squadron]], two Balloon companies (36th and 45th) and Artillery observers.

A former French then Russian camp located {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the airfield was "Camp Hunt", where infantry and artillery troops were trained before joining the Front.

Near this "Camp Hunt" a cemetery was established for American casualties; some of the pilots killed when serving at Cazaux were buried in this cemetery.

===American presence===
American Air Service pilots training was reinforced by the finishing course in aerial gunnery which permitted the American Air Service to give, under French supervision and direction, at French aerial gunnery school situated at Cazaux. This work, which commenced on December 1917, in a large measure neutralized the delay in getting an American aerial gunnery school into operation, and overcame the early difficulties caused by American lack of machine guns and ammunitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101013-007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that after graduation pilots were given a full course in shooting from the air, either at Cazaux or the American school at St.
Jean-de-Monts.

===Luftwaffe use===
After the French defeat Cazaux was used by Luftwaffe units from the summer of 1940 onwards. Several Training and Fighter units used the place, including the 1st group of the night fighter squadron NJG.2 or the 2nd and 3rd Fighter squadrons in Fighter Group JG26. Of the Destroyer Squad 1. Between spring 1943 and summer 1944, it was a target of allied air raids.

===French Air Force===
After German withdrawal French Air Force repaired the base, naming it Airfield R.51, and Cazaux was the home of the French bomber group GB 1/31 "Aunis" equipped with Ju-88 in the spring of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaviationmagazine.com/airshowsreview/2014_Meeting_Aerien%20_Cazaux_Air_Show.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962/1963 the Bomber group 2/91 "Guyenne", previously been deployed in the Algerian war, was stationed briefly. This Group was replaced in 1964 by No 293, Escadron de Chasse 2/8 “Nice" equipped with Mystère IV, which merged with the local shooting center and henceforth operated two flying groups. From 1982 on, units based in Cazaux were equipped with Alpha Jets as the Ecole de Transition Opérationnelle (E.T.O.) since 1995. Currently theere are two training squadrons in Cazaux, 1/8 and 2/8. In June 2004 Belgian 11 Squadron, equipped with Alpha jets, was relocated to Cazaux, forming the French-Belgian Alpha Jet School (AJetS).

Also based at Cazaux is 1/67th Pyrenees Squadron, a combat search and rescue helicopter unit equipped with [[EC-725]] Caracal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acc.af.mil/News/Features/Display/tabid/5765/Article/204115/exchanging-more-than-just-a-pilot.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottosenphotography.com/blog/2016/9/pyrenees&lt;/ref&gt; This is a joint unit, so its pilots come from different armed services, but is assigned namely to the French Air Force.

===Singapore Air Force presence===
Cazaux Air Base is home to 150 Squadron RSAF and its personnel. The RSAF has conducted flying training in France since 1998, and both Air Forces also interact regularly through various professional exchanges and courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/nr/2015/may/21may15_nr.html#.WDse_OnrvIU&lt;/ref&gt; 150 Squadron currently operates M-346 aircraft that replaced A-4SU in fighter pilots training. The Landes forest, the target centre of Captieux and the aerial zones of Golfe de Gascogne offer all the necessary space for RSAF pilots training requirements which RSAF cannot find in Singapore.

The '''Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis''' was proposed in 1905 by geologist [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin]] and astronomer [[Forest Ray Moulton]] to describe the formation of the [[solar system]]. It was proposed as a replacement for the [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplacian]] version of the [[nebular hypothesis]] that had prevailed since the 19th century.

The theory was based on the idea that a star passed close enough to the sun early in its life to cause tidal bulges to form on its surface, which along with the internal process that leads to [[solar prominence]]s, caused material to be ejected repeatedly from the sun. Due to the gravitational effects of the passing star, two spiral-like arms would have extended from the sun, and while most of the material would have fallen back, part of it would remain in orbit. This orbiting material would cool and condense into numerous small bodies that they termed [[planetesimal]]s and a few larger [[protoplanet]]s. Their theory proposed that as these objects collided over time, the planets and their moons were built up, with [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s being the leftover debris. The "spiral nebulae" photographed at [[Lick Observatory]] were thought to possibly be views of other suns undergoing this process. These nebulae are now known to be [[galaxy|galaxies]] rather than developing solar systems.

In 1917, [[James Hopwood Jeans]] argued that only a very close approach of a second star was necessary to eject material, instead of requiring solar prominences.  In 1939, [[Lyman Spitzer]] showed that a column of material drawn out from the sun would dissipate rather than condense. By this time the theory had mostly fallen out of favor, and in the 1940s, the work of [[Henry Norris Russell]] showed that if the solar material had been pulled away from the sun with the force necessary to account for the angular momentum of Jupiter, the material would have continued out of the solar system entirely.

Though the Chamberlin–Moulton hypothesis is no longer accepted, the idea of planetesimals remains in modern theory.

In [[religion]], '''divinity''' or '''godhead''' is the state of things that are believed to come from a [[supernatural power]] or [[deity]], such as a [[god]], supreme being, [[creator deity]], or [[spirit]]s, and are therefore regarded as [[sacred]] and [[holy]].&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;Wiktionary: "divine (comparative more divine, superlative most divine)
1) of or pertaining to a god
2) eternal, holy, or otherwise supernatural
3) of superhuman or surpassing excellence
4) beautiful, heavenly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/divine divine] - Dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divine divine] - Merriam Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such things are regarded as divine due to their [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] origins or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=wiktionary/&gt; Divine things are regarded as [[eternity|eternal]] and based in [[truth]],&lt;ref name=wiktionary/&gt; while material things are regarded as [[ephemeral]] and based in [[illusion]]. Such things that may qualify as divine are [[apparitional experience|apparitions]], [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s, [[prophecy|prophecies]], [[miracle]]s, and in some views also the [[soul]], or more general things like [[resurrection]], [[immortality]], [[divine grace|grace]], and [[salvation]]. Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different [[belief system]]s.

The root of the word "divine" is literally "godly" (from the Latin ''deus'', cf. ''[[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]]'', closely related to Greek ''[[zeus]]'', ''[[Daeva|div]]'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines the major distinctions in the [[conventional]] use of the terms.

For specific related [[academic]] terms, see [[Divinity (academic discipline)]], or [[Anglican divine|Divine (Anglican)]].

== Usages ==
Divinity as a quality has two distinct usages:
* [[#Divine force or power|Divine force or power]] - powers or forces that are universal, or transcend human capacities
* [[#Mortals|Divinity applied to mortals]] - qualities of individuals who are considered to have some special access or relationship to the divine.
Overlap occurs between these usages because [[deities]] or godly entities are often identical with or identified by the powers and forces that are credited to them&amp;nbsp;— in many cases a deity is merely a power or force personified&amp;nbsp;— and these powers and forces may then be extended or granted to [[Human|mortal]] individuals. For instance, [[Jehovah]] is closely associated with storms and thunder throughout much of the [[Old Testament]]. He is said to speak in thunder, and thunder is seen as a token of his anger. This power was then extended to [[Prophets in Judaism|prophets]] like [[Moses]] and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], who caused thunderous storms to rain down on their enemies. (See {{bibleverse||Exodus|9:23}} and [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 12:18.)

Divinity always carries connotations of [[good and evil|goodness]], [[beauty]], beneficence, [[justice]], and other positive, pro-social attributes. In [[monotheistic]] faiths there is an equivalent cohort of malefic [[supernatural]] beings and powers, such as [[demons]], [[devil]]s, [[afreet]], etc., which are not conventionally referred to as divine; ''demonic'' is often used instead. [[Pantheistic]] and [[polytheistic]] faiths make no such distinction; gods and other beings of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] power often have complex, ignoble, or even [[irrational]] motivations for their acts. Note that while the terms ''demon'' and ''demonic'' are used in [[monotheistic]] faiths as [[antonyms]] to ''divine'', they are in fact derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimón]]'' (δαίμων), which itself translates as ''divinity''.

There are three distinct usages of ''divinity'' and ''divine'' in religious [[discourse]]:

=== Entity ===
{{Main article|Deity}}
In monotheistic faiths, the word ''divinity'' is often used to refer to the [[singular God]] central to that faith. Often the word takes the [[definite article]] and is capitalized&amp;nbsp;— ''"the Divinity"''&amp;nbsp;— as though it were a [[proper name]] or definitive honorific. 
''Divine''&amp;nbsp;— capitalized&amp;nbsp;— may be used as an adjective to refer to the manifestations of such a Divinity or its powers: e.g. "basking in the Divine presence..."

The terms ''divinity'' and ''divine''&amp;nbsp;— uncapitalized, and lacking the definite article&amp;nbsp;— are sometimes used as to denote 'god(s)&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/greatstag.htm "The Great Stag: A Sumerian Divinity"] by Bobula Ida (''Yearbook of Ancient and Medieval History'' 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; or certain other beings and entities which fall short of absolute Godhood but lie outside the human realm. These include (by no means an exhaustive list):

=== Divine force or power ===
As previously noted, divinities are closely related to the transcendent force(s) or power(s) credited to them,&lt;ref&gt;note Augustine's argument that divinity is not a quality of God, but that "God is [...] Divinity itself" (Nature and Grace, part I, question 3, article 3) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/nature_grace.vi.iii.iii.html "Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature"]&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that in some cases the powers or forces may themselves be invoked independently. This leads to the second usage of the word ''divine'' (and a less common usage of ''divinity''): to refer to the operation of transcendent power in the world.

In its most direct form, the operation of transcendent power implies some form of [[Miracle|divine intervention]]. For pan- and polytheistic faiths this usually implies the direct action of one god or another on the course of human events. In Greek [[legend]], for instance, it was [[Poseidon]] (god of the sea) who raised the storms which blew [[Odysseus]]' craft off course on his return journey, and [[Japan]]ese tradition holds that a [[Kamikaze#Origin of the word Kamikaze|god-sent wind]] saved them from Mongol invasion. [[Prayer]]s or propitiations are often offered to specific gods of [[pantheism]]s to garner favorable interventions in particular enterprises: e.g. safe journeys, success in war, or a season of bountiful crops. Many faiths around the world&amp;nbsp;— from Japanese [[Shinto]] and Chinese traditional religion, to certain African practices and the faiths derived from those in the Caribbean, to Native American beliefs&amp;nbsp;— hold that [[ancestral]] or [[household deity|household deities]] offer daily protection and [[blessing]]s. In monotheistic religions, divine intervention may take very direct forms: [[miracles]], [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s, or [[Intercession of saints|intercessions]] by blessed figures.

Transcendent force or power may also operate through more subtle and indirect paths. Monotheistic faiths generally support some version of [[divine providence]], which acknowledges that the divinity of the faith has a profound but unknowable plan always unfolding in the world. Unforeseeable, overwhelming, or seemingly unjust events are often thrown on 'the will of the Divine', in deferences like the [[Muslim]] ''inshallah'' ('as God wills it') and Christian 'God works in mysterious ways'. Often such faiths hold out the possibility of [[divine retribution]] as well, where the divinity will unexpectedly bring [[evil]]-doers to justice through the conventional workings of the world; from the subtle redressing of minor personal [[wrongs]], to such large-scale havoc as the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] or the biblical [[Great Flood]]. Other faiths are even more subtle: the doctrine of ''[[karma]]'' shared by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is a [[divine law]] similar to [[divine retribution]] but without the connotation of punishment: our acts, good or bad, intentional or unintentional, reflect back on us as part of the natural working of the [[universe]]. Philosophical [[Taoism]] also proposes a transcendent operant principle&amp;nbsp;— transliterated in English as ''tao'' or ''dao'', meaning 'the way'&amp;nbsp;— which is neither an entity or a being per se, but reflects the natural ongoing process of the world. Modern [[western mysticism]] and [[new age]] philosophy often use the term 'the Divine' as a noun in this latter sense: a non-specific [[principle]] or being that gives rise to the world, and acts as the source or [[wellspring of life]]. In these latter cases the faiths do not promote deference, as happens in monotheisms; rather each suggests a path of action that will bring the practitioner into conformance with the divine law: ''ahimsa''&amp;nbsp;— 'no harm'&amp;nbsp;— for Buddhist and Hindu faiths; ''de'' or ''te''&amp;nbsp;— 'virtuous action'&amp;nbsp;— in Taoism; and any of numerous practices of peace and love in new age thinking.

=== Mortals ===
{{main article|apotheosis}}
In the third usage, extensions of divinity and divine power are credited to living, mortal individuals. Political leaders are known to have claimed actual divinity in certain early societies&amp;nbsp;— the ancient [[Egyptian Pharaohs]] being the premier case&amp;nbsp;— taking a role as objects of worship and being credited with superhuman status and powers. More commonly, and more pertinent to recent history, leaders merely claim some form of divine [[mandate (theology)|mandate]], suggesting that their rule is in accordance with the will of God. The doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]] was introduced as late as the 17th century, proposing that [[king]]s rule by divine decree; Japanese Emperors ruled by divine mandate until the inception of the [[Japanese constitution]] after [[World War II]].

Less politically, most faiths have any number of people that are believed to have been touched by divine forces: [[saint]]s, [[prophet]]s, [[hero]]es, [[oracle]]s, [[martyr]]s, and enlightened beings, among others. [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], in Catholicism, is said to have received instruction directly from [[God]] and it is believed that he grants [[plenary indulgence]] to all who confess their sins and visit his chapel on the appropriate day.  In Greek mythology, [[Achilles]]' mother bathed him in the [[river Styx]] to give him immortality, and [[Hercules]]&amp;nbsp;— as the son of [[Zeus]]&amp;nbsp;— inherited near-godly powers. In religious [[Taoism]], [[Lao Tsu]] is venerated as a saint with his own powers. Various individuals in the Buddhist faith, beginning with [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]], are considered to be enlightened, and in religious forms of Buddhism they are credited with divine powers. Christ is said to have performed divine miracles.

In general, mortals with divine qualities are carefully distinguished from the deity or deities in their religion's main [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].&lt;ref&gt;This is sometimes a [[controversial]] issue, however; see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/features/emperor/index.shtml], for example, for a discussion of the status of the [[Japan]]ese emperor.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Christian faith, which generally holds Christ to be identical to God, distinguishes between God the Father and Christ the begotten Son.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~emcd/index20.htm "The Divinity of Alpha's Jesus"] by Peterson &amp; McDonald (''Media Spotlight'' 25:4, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, certain esoteric and mystical schools of thought, present in many faiths&amp;nbsp;— [[Sufi]]s in Islam, [[Gnostic]]s in Christianity, Advaitan Hindus, [[Zen Buddhist]]s, as well as several non-specific perspectives developed in new age philosophy&amp;nbsp;— which hold that all humans are in [[essence]] divine, or unified with the Divine in a non-trivial way. Such divinity, in these faiths, would express itself naturally if it were not obscured by the social and physical worlds we live in; it needs to be brought to the fore through appropriate [[spiritual practice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx "Twelve Signs of Your Awakening Divinity"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223313/http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }} by Geoffrey Hoppe and Tobias&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==

In traditional [[Christian theology]], the concept and nature of divinity always has its source ultimately from God himself. It's the state or quality of being divine, and the term can denote Godly nature or character.  In Hebrew, the terms would usually be "[[El (deity)|el]]", "[[elohim]]", and in Greek usually "theos", or "theias". The divinity in the Bible is considered the Godhead itself, or God in general. Or it may have reference to a deity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/divinity divinity] - The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; Even angels in the [[Psalms]] are considered divine or ''elohim'', as spirit beings, in God's form. Redeemed Christians [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]] or believers, according to Biblical verses, are said to partake of the "divine nature" through the "exceeding great and precious promises" of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4).

In the [[Christian Greek Scriptures]] of the Bible, the Greek word θεῖον (''theion'') in the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay Version]], is translated as "divinity". Examples are below:
* Acts 17:29
:"Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man."
* Romans 1:20
:"For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable."
* Revelation 5:12
:"Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction."

The word translated as either "deity", "Godhead", or "divinity" in the Greek New Testament is also the Greek word θεότητος (''theotētos''), and the one Verse that contains it is this:
Colossians 2:9
:"Quia in ipso inhabitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis [divinity] corporaliter." (Vulgate)
:"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." (KJV)
:"Because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily." (NWT)
:"For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form." (NET)
:"For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ." (TEV)

The word "divine" in the New Testament is the Greek word θείας (''theias''), and is the adjective form of "divinity". Biblical examples from the [[King James Bible]] are below:
* 2 Peter 1:3
:"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
* 2 Peter 1:4
:"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."

=== Latter-day Saints ===
{{main article|God in Mormonism|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon cosmology}}

The most prominent conception of divine entities in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]], a divine council of three distinct beings: [[Elohim]] ([[God the Father|the Father]]), [[Jehovah]] ([[God the Son|the Son]], or [[Jesus]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christian denominational variations)#Latter Day Saints|Holy Spirit]]. [[Joseph Smith]] described a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] Godhead, with God the Father and Jesus Christ each having individual physical bodies, and the Holy Spirit as a distinct personage with a [[spirit body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/130/22#21 D&amp;C 130:22] "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Godhead |work= True to the Faith |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2004 |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/godhead}}. See also: {{citation |title= God the Father |work= True to the Faith |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2004 |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/god-the-father}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also introduced the existence of a [[Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)|Heavenly Mother]] in the [[King Follett Discourse]], but very little is acknowledged or known beyond her existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url= http://lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-2-our-heavenly-family?lang=eng|chapter=Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family|title=[[Gospel Principles]]|year= 2009|publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Spencer W. |last= Kimball |authorlink= Spencer W.

[[Mormons]] hold a belief in the divine potential of humanity; Smith taught a form of [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]] where mortal men and women can become like god through [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|salvation]] and [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]]. [[Lorenzo Snow]] succinctly summarized this using a [[couplet]], which is often repeated within the LDS Church: "As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lund |first= Gerald N. |authorlink= Gerald N.

[[File:2008-04-17 ECU.jpg|thumb|right|An ECU from a [[Geo Storm]]]]

An '''Electronic Control Unit''' ('''ECU''') is any [[embedded system]] in [[automotive electronics]] that controls one or more of the [[Automotive_electronics#Types|electrical systems]] or subsystems in a vehicle.

Types of ECU include Electronic Control Unit, [[Engine control unit|Engine Control Module]] (ECM), Powertrain Control Module (PCM), Transmission Control Module (TCM), Brake Control Module (BCM or EBCM), Central Control Module (CCM), Central Timing Module (CTM), General Electronic Module (GEM), [[Body Control Module]] (BCM), Suspension Control Module (SCM), control unit, or control module. Taken together, these systems are sometimes referred to as the car's computer (Technically there is no single computer but multiple ones.) Sometimes one assembly incorporates several of the individual control modules (PCM is often both engine and transmission).&lt;ref name="NIwhite"&gt;[http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3312/en/ National Instruments White Paper on Electronic Control Units] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221083019/http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3312/en/ |date=2013-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern [[motor vehicles]] have up to 80 ECUs. [[Embedded software]] in ECUs continues to increase in line count, complexity, and sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software: Facts, Figures, and Future | last1=Ebert| first1=Christof| last2=Jones| first2=Capers| publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press | date=2009-04-01 | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1550393.1550433 | accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managing the increasing complexity and number of ECUs in a vehicle has become a key challenge for [[original equipment manufacturer#Automotive parts|original equipment manufacturers]] (OEMs). 

==Types==
* [[Door control unit]] (DCU)
* [[Engine control unit]] (ECU) — not to be confused with ''electronic'' control unit, the generic term for all these devices
* [[Electric Power Steering Control Unit]] (PSCU) — Generally this will be integrated into the [[Power steering#Electric systems|EPS]] powerpack.
* [[Human-machine interface]] (HMI)
* [[Powertrain control module]] (PCM): Sometimes the functions of the [[Engine Control Unit]] and [[transmission control unit]] (TCU) are combined into a single unit called the Powertrain Control Module.
* Seat Control Unit
* [[Cruise control|Speed control unit]] (SCU)
* [[Telematic control unit]] (TCU)
* [[Transmission control unit]] (TCU)
* Brake Control Module (BCM; [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] or [[Electronic stability control|ESC]])

==Design and development==
The development of an ECU involves both hardware and software required to perform the functions expected from that particular module. Automotive ECU's are being developed following the V-model.&lt;ref name="NIwhite"/&gt; Recently the trend is to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to develop safe modules by following standards like [[ISO 26262]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ai-online.com/Adv/Previous/show_issue.php?id=4376 |title= Fast-tracking ECU development |first= Lenny |last= Case |journal= Automotive Industries |date= October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is rare that a module is developed fully from scratch. The design is generally iterative and improvements are made to both the hardware and software. The development of most ECU's are carried out by Tier 1 suppliers based on specifications provided by the OEM.

==Testing and validation==
As part of the development cycle, manufacturers perform detailed [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEAs]] and other failure analyses to catch failure modes that can lead to unsafe conditions or driver annoyance. Extensive testing and validation activities are carried out as part of the [[Production part approval process]] to gain confidence of the hardware and software. [[On-board diagnostics]] or OBD help provide specific data related to which system or component failed or caused a failure during run time and help perform repairs.

==Tuning==
Some people may wish to modify their ECU so as to be able to add more functionality to it. Most ECU's these days however come equipped with protection locks which prevent users from modifying the ECU. The protection locks are made in a way that, when circumvented, triggers [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] liability. This in effect makes modifying the ECU by circumventing the protection illegal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/let-us-hack-our-cars/| title= Circumventing ECU protection being illegal}}&lt;/ref&gt; except if done under an exception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2015-27212/page-65954| title=Federal Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the DMCA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7609">'''Fiction Theory''' is a discipline that applies [[possible world]] theory to literature. Fiction theory scholars and critics have articulated various theses rooted in [[Saul Kripke]]’s application of [[modal logic]] to [[semantics]]. Drawing on concepts found in possible world theory, theorists of fiction study the relationships between textual worlds and the world outside the text.  The overarching idea in fiction theory is that the relationships between the imaginary worlds of fiction and the actual world in which we live are complicated, and that one ought not dismiss fiction as simply stories that are not “true.” Theorists of fiction pose challenging questions about, and offer constructive ways of exploring, the often complex relations between the worlds of fiction and the “real” world in which we live. 

== Fundamentals of fiction theory ==
In order to understand fiction theory, one must pose questions about fundamental terms such as text, narrative, literature, fiction, etc.  Literature may be understood as a text that is self-consciously artistic, rather than as a text that is used as a medium through which to convey information, for example a newspaper article. [[Roman Jakobson]], a Russian formalist and linguist, was one of the first individuals to discuss art as a way of communication that is intentionally aesthetic, and applied linguistics to analyses of literary texts. In his well-known communication model, Jakobson breaks apart a communicative act between an addressor and addressee into a message, code, context, and contact, with each part having its own function.  According to Jakobson’s model, art is created when the message itself (which carries the poetic function) is stressed. 

The French scholar [[Roland Barthes]] designed a system of [[five major codes]] that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of plot and structure, thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative. 

Jakobson’s model and Barthes’s codes offer critics a way to begin to explore the nature of a literary text through application of [[semiotics]] to [[narrative]].

== The Actual versus the Fictive ==
While Jakobson and Barthes emphasize the intention of the speaker/writer, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] examines the broader question of how we create imaginary worlds and categorizes our “Ways of Worldmaking” (the title of his book on this topic) into composition/decomposition, weighting, ordering, deletion/supplementation, and reformations. The scholar [[Marie-Laure Ryan]] is also concerned less with intention and more with the various ways that fictional worlds are related to the actual world outside the text. Ryan conceptualizes these relations in a framework of accessibility and has developed a typology of accessibility relations that establishes the extent to which fictional worlds are similar to or different from the actual world in which we live. The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the “principle of minimal departure.” This idea was first articulated by [[John Searle]] and refers to the fundamental property of an imaginary world that is minimally different from the familiar world in which we live. Lubomir Dolezel has developed a similar typology based on [[modal operator]]s that determine the narrative world.

[[Frank Kermode]], in his seminal text ''[[The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction]]'', argues that ultimate meaning is derived from the end; successive events are predicated on previously established meaning.  He articulates a concept of fiction based on this view of humans’ constant yearning for an ultimate end that will imbue with meaning everything that preceded it. In this discussion, Kermode distinguishes between fiction and myth.  Fiction consists of stories all individuals create about their lives in order to keep on living in a world that makes few guarantees and is full of inexplicable phenomena. Kermode defines myth as a dangerous fiction used for exploitative purposes.  The philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] has articulated similar ideas, putting forth the biological argument that human beings use fictions to help survive in a hostile environment, and that these fictions are so useful that it becomes most difficult, if not impossible, for us to stop ourselves from creating fictions.  In Vaihinger’s language, fiction is something we treat “as if” it is true even when we know that it is not true, whereas myth is something we treat as true because we do not know it is false. 

Literary critic [[Thomas Pavel]] argues that the fictional world deserves to be examined on its own terms rather than merely through the lens of [[mimesis]].  His thesis serves as a critique of [[Structuralism]] by its insistence on the idea that narrativity, as a fundamental aspect of fiction, removes the possibility of pure imitation of the actual world.  Pavel’s theory thus departs from the main ideas of other fiction theorists because he separates literature from its referential relationship to the actual world. Following in the footsteps of the Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]], Pavel asserts that fictional worlds demand tremendous respect for their ability to serve as powerful tools of knowledge rather than for their likeness to the actual world.

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Biotechnology]]''' is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bud|first1=Robert|last2=Cantley|first2=Mark F.|title=The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=9780521476997|pages=1, 6, 7, 30, 133, 135, 138, 141–142, 155, 171–173, 165, 167, 174, 177, &amp; 191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGFQNf_PcPwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, biotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now most often associated with the development of [[drug]]s, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as [[malnutrition]] and [[famine]]. The history of [[biotechnology]] begins with [[Zymology|zymotechnology]], which commenced with a focus on [[brewing]] techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of [[industrial fermentation]] gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.

Yet the formation of a new field, [[genetic engineering]], would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the [[Asilomar Conference]], where [[Joshua Lederberg]] was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human [[insulin]], Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.

The field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society with the advent of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell research]], [[cloning]], and [[genetically modified food]]. While it seems only natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.

==Origins of biotechnology==
Biotechnology arose from the field of zymotechnology or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, [[brewing]] contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government.&lt;ref name="Thackray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackray|first1=Arnold|title=Private Science: Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812234282|pages=6–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUX5DUTldwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.

The heyday and expansion of zymotechnology came in World War I in response to industrial needs to support the war. [[Max Delbrück (chemist)|Max Delbrück]] grew yeast on an immense scale during the war to meet 60 percent of Germany's animal feed needs.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; Compounds of another fermentation product, [[lactic acid]], made up for a lack of hydraulic fluid, [[glycerol]]. On the Allied side the Russian chemist [[Chaim Weizmann]] used starch to eliminate Britain's shortage of [[acetone]], a key raw material for [[cordite]], by fermenting maize to acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sifniades|first1=Stylianos|last2=Levy|first2=Alan B.|title=Acetone|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_079|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial potential of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] was outgrowing its traditional home in brewing, and "zymotechnology" soon gave way to "biotechnology."

With food shortages spreading and resources fading, some dreamed of a new industrial solution. The Hungarian [[Károly Ereky]] coined the word "biotechnology" in Hungary during 1919 to describe a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also a fattening farm with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. In a book entitled ''Biotechnologie'', Ereky further developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term "biotechnologie" indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products.&lt;ref name="Fiechter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiechter|first1=A.|last2=Beppu|first2=T.|title=History of Modern Biotechnology I|date=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540677932|pages=153 &amp; 170|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ha6RNLb_UFQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This catchword spread quickly after the First World War, as "biotechnology" entered German dictionaries and was taken up abroad by business-hungry private consultancies as far away as the United States. In Chicago, for example, the coming of [[prohibition]] at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the "Bureau of Biotechnology," which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The belief that the needs of an industrial society could be met by fermenting agricultural waste was an important ingredient of the "chemurgic movement."&lt;ref name="Fiechter" /&gt;  Fermentation-based processes generated products of ever-growing utility. In the 1940s, [[penicillin]] was the most dramatic. While it was discovered in England, it was produced industrially in the U.S. using a deep fermentation process originally developed in Peoria, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J. J.|last2=Grenfell|first2=E.|last3=Legge|first3=B. J.|last4=Mcallister|first4=R. C.

Doctors used the phrase "miracle drug", and the historian of its wartime use, David Adams, has suggested that to the public penicillin represented the perfect health that went together with the car and the dream house of wartime American advertising.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt;  Beginning in the 1950s, fermentation technology also became advanced enough to produce [[steroids]] on industrially significant scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capek|first1=Milantadra|last2=Oldrich|first2=Hanc|last3=Alois|first3=Capek|title=Microbial Transformations of Steroids|date=1966|publisher=Academia Publishing House of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|location=Prague|isbn=9789401176057|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was the improved [[semisynthesis]] of [[cortisone]] which simplified the old 31 step synthesis to 11 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leigh|first1=H.

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|left| [[Penicillin]] was viewed as a miracle drug that brought enormous profits and public expectations.]]

==Single-cell protein and gasohol projects==
Even greater expectations of biotechnology were raised during the 1960s by a process that grew single-cell protein. When the so-called protein gap threatened world hunger, producing food locally by growing it from waste seemed to offer a solution. It was the possibilities of growing microorganisms on oil that captured the imagination of scientists, policy makers, and commerce.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Major companies such as [[British Petroleum]] (BP) staked their futures on it. In 1962, BP built a pilot plant at Cap de Lavera in Southern France to publicize its product, Toprina.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Initial research work at Lavera was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]],&lt;ref name=bamberg&gt;{{cite book|first=J.

As there was no well-accepted term to describe the new foods, in 1966 the term "[[single-cell protein]]" (SCP) was coined at [[MIT]] to provide an acceptable and exciting new title, avoiding the unpleasant connotations of microbial or bacterial.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The "food from oil" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, when  facilities for growing yeast fed by n-[[Alkane|paraffin]]s were built in a number of countries. The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were particularly enthusiastic, opening large "BVK" (''belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat'', i.e., "protein-vitamin concentrate") plants next to their oil refineries in [[Kstovo]] (1973) &lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C55137B93C2A8178AD95F478785F9 Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved], By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kstovo.ru/index-name-Content-op-view-id-41.html Первенец микробиологической промышленности] (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (''Kstovo, Russia's Young City'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirishi]] (1974).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the late 1970s, however, the cultural climate had completely changed, as the growth in SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, the [[price of oil]] rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had been two years earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

This was particularly vocal in Japan, where production came closest to fruition. For all their enthusiasm for innovation and traditional interest in microbiologically produced foods, the Japanese were the first to ban the production of single-cell proteins. The Japanese ultimately were unable to separate the idea of their new "natural" foods from the far from natural connotation of oil.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; These arguments were made against a background of suspicion of heavy industry in which anxiety over minute traces of [[petroleum]] was expressed. Thus, public resistance to an unnatural product led to the end of the SCP project as an attempt to solve world hunger.

Also, in 1989 in the USSR, the public environmental concerns made the government decide to close down (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had by that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, biotechnology offered another possible solution to a societal crisis. The escalation in the price of oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of [[gasohol]], gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

Biotechnology seemed to be the solution for major social problems, including world hunger and energy crises. In the 1960s, radical measures would be needed to meet world starvation, and biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. However, the solutions proved to be too expensive and socially unacceptable, and solving world hunger through SCP food was dismissed. In the 1970s, the food crisis was succeeded by the energy crisis, and here too, biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. But once again, costs proved prohibitive as oil prices slumped in the 1980s. Thus, in practice, the implications of biotechnology were not fully realized in these situations. But this would soon change with the rise of [[genetic engineering]].

==Genetic engineering==
The origins of biotechnology culminated with the birth of [[genetic engineering]]. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]], by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a [[recombinant DNA]] technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt; This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as "genetic engineering," it came to be defined as the basis of new biotechnology.

Genetic engineering proved to be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart at the center of the soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;  During the same month, [[Arthur Kornberg]] announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. "Life had been synthesized," said the head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as [[beta thalassemia]] and [[sickle-cell anemia]].

Responses to scientific achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, ''The Biological Time Bomb'', was written by the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; The book ended with a chapter called "The Future – If Any." While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of "[[Star Trek]]", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. "[[Cloning]]" became a popular word in the media. [[Woody Allen]] satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', and cloning [[Adolf Hitler]] from surviving cells was the theme of the 1976 novel by [[Ira Levin]], ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

In response to these public concerns, scientists, industry, and governments increasingly linked the power of [[recombinant DNA]] to the immensely practical functions that biotechnology promised. One of the key scientific figures that attempted to highlight the promising aspects of genetic engineering was [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Stanford professor and [[Nobel laureate]]. While in the 1960s "genetic engineering" described eugenics and work involving the manipulation of the [[human genome]], Lederberg stressed research that would involve microbes instead.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg emphasized the importance of focusing on curing living people. Lederberg's 1963 paper, "Biological Future of Man" suggested that, while molecular biology might one day make it possible to change the human genotype, "what we have overlooked is [[euphenics]], the engineering of human development."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg constructed the word "euphenics" to emphasize changing the [[phenotype]] after conception rather than the [[genotype]] which would affect future generations.

With the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggesting that the consequences of this work were so potentially destructive that there should be a pause until its implications had been thought through.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]]. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines were established.

[[Joshua Lederberg]] was the leading exception in emphasizing, as he had for years, the potential benefits. At [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], in an atmosphere favoring control and regulation, he circulated a paper countering the pessimism and fears of misuses with the benefits conferred by successful use. He described "an early chance for a technology of untold importance for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine: the ready production of an unlimited variety of human [[proteins]]. Analogous applications may be foreseen in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for cheaply manufacturing essential nutrients, and in the improvement of [[microbes]] for the production of [[antibiotics]] and of special industrial chemicals."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In June 1976, the 16-month moratorium on research expired with the Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) publication of the NIH guidelines of good practice. They defined the risks of certain kinds of experiments and the appropriate physical conditions for their pursuit, as well as a list of things too dangerous to perform at all. Moreover, [[modified organisms]] were not to be tested outside the confines of a laboratory or allowed into the environment.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|Synthetic [[insulin]] crystals synthesized using [[recombinant DNA]] technology]]

Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic vision of [[genetic engineering]] would soon lead to the development of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of [[recombinant DNA]] research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. [[Insulin]], one of the smaller,  best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating [[type 1 diabetes]] for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic [[human insulin]], one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic "human" insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the new biotechnology. Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="Krimsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krimsky|first1=Sheldon|title=Biotechnics &amp; society: the rise of industrial genetics|date=1991|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780275938598|pages=18, &amp; 21|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-XbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=027593859X&amp;dq=027593859X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces [[human growth hormone]], by the [[University of California]], thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The radical shift in the connotation of "genetic engineering" from an emphasis on the inherited characteristics of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Biotechnology and industry==
[[File:South San Francisco gateway sign.jpg|thumb|right|A Genentech-sponsored sign declaring South San Francisco to be "The Birthplace of Biotechnology."]]
With ancestral roots in [[industrial microbiology]] that date back centuries, the new biotechnology industry grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support.&lt;ref name="Krimsky" /&gt;  Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade organizations such as the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).

The main focus of attention after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: [[human growth hormone]] and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, [[interferon]]. [[Cancer]] was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grace|first1=Eric S.|title=Biotechnology Unzipped:: Promises and Realities|date=2006|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309096218|pages=78 &amp; 155|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtOv07UmQgAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, a new company, [[Biogen]], had produced [[interferon]] through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon and the possibility of curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. Moreover, to the 1970s plight of cancer was added [[AIDS]] in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="Colwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rita R|first1=Colwell|title=Fulfilling the promise of biotechnology|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2002|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=215–228|doi=10.1016/S0734-9750(02)00011-3|pmid=14550029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): synthetic [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[alpha-interferon]], and [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

The 2007–2008 [[global financial crisis]] led to several changes in the way the biotechnology industry was financed and organized. First, it led to a decline in overall financial investment in the sector, globally; and second, in some countries like the UK it led to a shift from business strategies focused on going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to seeking a [[trade sale]] instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birch|first=Kean|date=2016-08-10|title=Rethinking Value in the Bio-economy|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=460–490|doi=10.1177/0162243916661633|pmid=28458406|pmc=5390941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, financial investment in the biotechnology industry started to improve again and by 2014 the global market capitalization reached $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic engineering also reached the agricultural front as well. There was tremendous progress since the market introduction of the genetically engineered [[Flavr Savr tomato]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;  Ernst and Young reported that in 1998, 30% of the U.S. soybean crop was expected to be from genetically engineered seeds. In 1998, about 30% of the US cotton and corn crops were also expected to be products of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

Genetic engineering in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From the perspective of its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became a normal part of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.

==Global trends==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
According to Burrill and Company, an industry investment bank, over $350 billion has been invested in biotech since the emergence of the industry, and global revenues rose from $23 billion in 2000 to more than $50 billion in 2005. The greatest growth has been in [[Latin America]] but all regions of the world have shown strong growth trends.  By 2007 and into 2008, though, a downturn in the fortunes of biotech emerged, at least in the United Kingdom, as the result of declining investment in the face of failure of biotech pipelines to deliver and a consequent downturn in return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Sue |date=2008-08-01 |title=Is the U.K. Biotech Industry on the Skids? |journal=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2546&amp;chid=0 |issn=1935-472X|accessdate =2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improvisational theatre''', often called '''provisation ''' or '''improv''', is the form of [[theatre]], often [[comedy]], in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].

Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.

Improvisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]]. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=Béatrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers’ Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

==History==
The earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed. Alison Hodge. New York: Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Nobel-winner [[Dario Fo]] received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style]]
Modern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the [[progressive education]] movement initiated by [[John Dewey]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/tspwb1hist.html|title=TheatreSports History|work=interactiveimprov.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people credit American [[Dudley Riggs]] as the first [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',&lt;ref name="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

Spolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.&lt;ref name=Wonderful&gt;The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book "Something Wonderful Right Away" (Limelight Editions, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;Janet Coleman's "The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the current "rules" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her protégé, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.&lt;ref name=Wonderful /&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt;

Many of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].
[[File:Ligue d'improvisation montréalaise (LIM) 20110306.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Montreal Improvisation League]]
Simultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.

In 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.

In San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.

Modern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s "happenings" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s "Forum Theatre" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.

[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.

In 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre &amp; Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called [[netprov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichtung-digital.de/en/journal/aktuelle-nummer/?postID=577|title=Current Issue - Dichtung Digital|work=dichtung-digital.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form relies on [[social media]] to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.

==Improvisational comedy==
[[File:Improvisers in Chicago.jpeg|thumb|Three improvisers performing longform improv comedy at the Gorilla Tango Theatre in Chicago.]]
Modern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.

Shortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined [[Theater game|game]], structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; The shortform improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.

Longform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]]; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Detroit]], [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; and is building a growing following in [[Denver]], [[Montreal]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[New Orleans]], [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hawaii]]. Outside the [[United States]], longform improv has a growing presence in the [[United Kingdom]], especially in cities such as [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==
Other forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde&lt;ref&gt;Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans&lt;/ref&gt; in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.

[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as "sound and movement" and "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s "[[poor theater]]" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason="[1]"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.

Longform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.

==Applying improv principles in life==
Many people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what's going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say "yes." And if you're lucky, you'll find people who will say "yes" back.}}

[[Tina Fey]] in her book ''[[Bossypants]]'' lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109232959/http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-09 |title=Tina Fey's Rules For Improv… And Your Career |work=Women 2.0 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html "Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, "executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves."

==In film and television==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Many directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.

Some of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Rob Reiner]].

Improv comedy techniques have also been used in television and [[Stand-up comedian|stand-up comedy]] in hit shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Thick of It]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; also had some improvised elements in them.

==Psychology==
In the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569780120070722#preview |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.

In the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, and"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and process==
Improvisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.

In order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as ''gagging''—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, And..."]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''"Yes, And..."'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a "base (or shared) reality" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or "miraculously" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.

Because improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.

==Community==
Many theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.

In addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.

In Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.

==Notable Contributors To The Field==
Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer–author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of "Commun-edy Outreach" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.

[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true "people's Theatre", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of "That Movie In Your Head", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name "ImprovOlympic" and now as "IO"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's "Time Dash" game with Del Close's "Harold" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.

[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the "second generation" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the "Clap-In" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.

In the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.

Gunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativität des Improvisationstheaters''. Gunter Lösel. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anatomy]], a '''joint capsule''' or '''articular capsule''' is an envelope surrounding a [[synovial joint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=Articular+capsule eMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412020141/http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=Articular+capsule |date=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each joint capsule has two parts: an outer fibrous layer or membrane, and an inner synovial layer or membrane.

==Membranes==
Each capsule consists of two layers or membranes:
* an outer ('''fibrous membrane''', ''fibrous stratum'') composed of avascular white fibrous tissue
* an inner (''[[synovial membrane]]'', ''synovial stratum'') which is a secreting layer

On the inside of the capsule, articular cartilage covers the end surfaces of the bones that articulate within that joint.

The outer layer is highly innervated by the same nerves which perforate through the adjacent muscles associated with the joint.

==Fibrous membrane==
The fibrous membrane of the joint capsule is attached to the whole circumference of the articular end of each [[bone]] entering into the joint, and thus entirely surrounds the articulation.  It is made up of dense irregular connective tissue. It's a long spongy tissue.

==Clinical significance==
[[Frozen shoulder]] (adhesive capsulitis) is a disorder in which the [[shoulder]] capsule becomes inflamed.

[[Plica syndrome]] is a disorder in which the synovial plica becomes inflamed and causes abnormal biomechanics in the knee.

'''Langdon Winner''' (born August 7, 1944) is Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Department of [[Science and Technology Studies]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Troy, New York]].

Langdon Winner was born in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] on August 7, 1944. He received his B.A. in 1966, M.A. in 1967 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1973, all in [[political science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His primary focus was political theory.

He has been a professor at [[University of Leiden|Leiden]], [[MIT]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Since 1985 he has been at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]; he was a visiting professor at [[Harvey Mudd College]] (2000) and Colgate University (2001).  In 2010 he was a Fulbright Fellow visiting the Universidad Complutense in Madrid.

Winner lives in upstate New York. He is married to Gail P. Stuart and has three children. His interests include [[science]], [[technology]], American [[popular culture]], and theories of [[sustainability]].

Winner is known for his articles and books on science, technology, and society. He also spent several years as a reporter, rock music critic, and contributing editor for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/about/|title=About: Brief Biography|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and politics==
In 1980 Winner proposed that technologies embody social relations, i.e. power.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in ''Daedalus'', Vol. 109, No. 1, Winter 1980. Reprinted in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] and Judy Wajcman (London: Open University Press, 1985; second edition 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; To the question he poses "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", Winner identifies two ways in which artifacts can have politics.  The first, involving technical arrangements and social order, concerns how the invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts or the larger system becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community.  This way "transcends the simple categories of 'intended' and 'unintended' altogether", representing "instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and crushing setbacks by others" (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;25-6, 1999).  It implies that the process of technological development is critical in determining the politics of an artifact; hence the importance of incorporating all stakeholders in it. (Determining who the stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are other questions entirely.)

The second way in which artifacts can have politics refers to artifacts that correlate with particular kinds of political relationships, which Winner refers to as inherently political artifacts (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;22, 1999).  He distinguishes between two types of inherently political artifacts: those that require a particular sociological system and those that are strongly compatible with a particular sociological system (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;29, 1999).  A further distinction is made between conditions internal to the workings of a given technical system and those that are external to it (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;33, 1999).  This second way in which artifacts can have politics can be further articulated as consisting of four 'types' of artifacts: those requiring a particular internal sociological system, those compatible with a particular internal sociological system, those requiring a particular external sociological system, and those compatible with a particular external sociological system.

Certain features of Winner's thesis have been criticized by other scholars, including [[Bernward Joerges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2628379/Do_Politics_Have_Artefacts_1999_ An attempted rebuttal to Winner’s argument is Bernward Joerges’ “Do Politics have Artefacts?” (Requires sign-in)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such criticisms are often narrowly focused upon particular cases in Winner's essays, the height of the bridges built by Robert Moses on the Long Island Parkway, for example, and tend to overlook his general arguments about the interweaving of political institutions and technological devices.

==Music==
Winner contributed piano and backing vocals to the hoax album [[The Masked Marauders]] created by ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"&gt;{{citation | title = The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings | publisher = Rhino Records | accessdate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of educational technologies ==
Over the years one focus of Winner's criticism has been the excessive use of technologies in the classroom, both in K-12 schools and higher education. Winner's critique is well explained in his article "Information Technology and Educational Amnesia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=2009-12-01|title=Information Technology and Educational Amnesia|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/other-writings/2017/6/13/information-technology-and-educational-amnesia|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=7|issue=6|pages=587-591|doi=10.2304/pfie.2009.7.6.587|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed in his satirical lecture, "The Automatic Professor Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/videos-and-music/|title=Videos and Music|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National Defense College of the Philippines in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City.png|thumb|right|National Defense College of the Philippines]]

The '''National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP)''' (Filipino: ''Dalubhasaan ng Tanggulang Pambansa ng Pilipinas'') is an educational, training, and research agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] located inside Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]].  It is responsible for providing continued and intensive studies of the diverse problems relating to national defense and security.  It is under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]].

==History==
The National Defense College of the Philippines was first conceived in 1957 when the military advisors of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) proposed the setting-up of a SEATO War College in the [[Philippines]].

There were legislative moves to pass a law creating the National Defense College of the Philippines. In the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Congressman Manuel A. Zosa filed the House Bill No. 1420 in 1970 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” Also in the same year, then Congressman [[Ramon Bagatsing]] filed the House Bill No. 1447 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines, Providing an Academic Board, and for Other Purposes.” In the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], Senator Leonardo B. Perez filed the Senate Bill No. 597 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” However, these legislative proposals did not reach third reading because [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dissolved the [[Philippine Congress]].

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] subsequently issued Presidential Decree No. 190 in 1973 to formally create the NDCP to "fulfill the need for an institution that will provide for continuing and intensive studies of the diversified problems related to national defense and security." NDCP was then placed under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Office of the Secretary of National Defense]] in 1974 by virtue of P.D. No. 452.

The Academic and Admission Boards were later established to oversee the academic program of the College. To carry out its teaching function, the NDCP draws top experts from the academe and senior officers with command and staff experiences from the major services of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

Lectures by foreign diplomats, technical experts and defense leaders also complement the instruction at the NDCP. The NDCP has managed to grow beyond its modest beginnings to train leaders in the military and civilian bureaucracy in strategic thinking.

On February 22, 1998, the College moved to its new and modern three-story building in the Academic Row, Camp [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]].

==Master in National Security Administration Program==
The '''Master in National Security Administration''' (MNSA) Program is the main academic program of the NDCP. It is a one-year, full-time master's degree course consisting of 39 units earned through various forms of classroom work, case studies, regional security and development studies and academic enhancement travels.

The MNSA curriculum focuses on the various dimensions of [[national security]] management:
# socio-cultural dimension
# political-legal dimension
# economic dimension
# techno-scientific dimension
# environmental dimension
# military dimension

The MNSA is open to military officers, government officials and private sector leaders. Students write a [[national security]]-oriented thesis. Civilian graduates are commissioned [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s or [[Commander]]s in the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] Reserve Force.

==Strategic Research and Special Studies==
===Institute for National Security Studies===
The '''Institute for National Security Studies (INSS)''' administers the research program of the NDCP. It embodies the College's effort to be the center of excellence in strategic thinking on [[national security]] matters in the [[Philippines]] and in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Crisis Management Institute===
The '''Crisis Management Institute (CMI)''', formerly the ''Emergency Management Institute of the Philippines (EMIP)'', is envisioned to be the country's center for education, training, and research on [[crisis management]], [[terrorism]], and other [[transnational crime]]s, and as the premier training resource for technical cooperation in emergency management in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Defense Management Institute===
The '''Defense Management Institute (DMI)''', formerly the ''Institute for Extramural and Continuing Studies (IECS)'', is envisioned to be the key training institution on certificate and diploma courses on National Security Administration and to be a recognized training institution in the [[Asia-Pacific]].

==Notable alumni==

'''Noise control''' or '''noise mitigation''' is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] or to reduce the impact of that noise, whether outdoors or indoors.

==Overview==
The main areas of noise mitigation or abatement are: [[transportation]] noise control, [[architecture|architectural]] design, [[urban planning]] through [[zoning codes]],&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen, [http://blogs.gre.ac.uk/architecture/2010/10/03/open-lecture-benz-kotzen-noise-is-an-urban-issue/ "Noise is an urban issue"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[industrial noise|occupational noise]] control. [[Roadway noise]] and [[aircraft noise]] are the most pervasive sources of [[environmental noise]]. Social activities may generate noise levels that consistently affect the health of populations residing in or occupying areas, both indoor and outdoor, near entertainment venues that feature amplified sounds and music that present significant challenges for effective noise mitigation strategies.

Multiple techniques have been developed to address interior sound levels, many of which are encouraged by local [[building code]]s; in the best case of project designs, planners are encouraged to work with [[design engineer]]s to examine trade-offs of roadway design and architectural design. These techniques include design of exterior walls, party walls, and floor and ceiling assemblies; moreover, there are a host of specialized means for damping reverberation from special-purpose rooms such as [[auditorium|auditoria]], [[concert hall]]s, entertainment and social venues, dining areas, audio recording rooms, and meeting rooms.

Many of these techniques rely upon materials science applications of constructing [[sound baffle]]s or using sound-absorbing liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis on specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations.

[[Sound masking]] is the active addition of noise to reduce the annoyance of certain sounds; the opposite of [[soundproofing]].

== Approaches to Noise Control ==
An effective model for noise control is the source, path, and receiver model by Bolt and Ingard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Noise Control|last1=Harris|first1=CM|date=1957|publisher=McGraw-Hill:22-31|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous noise can be controlled by reducing the noise output at its source, minimizing the noise as it travels along a path to the listener, and providing equipment to the listener or receiver to attenuate the noise.

=== Source ===
A variety of measures aim to reduce hazardous noise at its source. Programs such as [[Buy Quiet]] and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [[Prevention through design]] promote research and design of quiet equipment and renovation and replacement of older hazardous equipment with modern technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-121/|title=Prevention Through Design: Plan for the National Initiative|website=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical materials, such as foam to absorb sound and walls to provide a sound barrier, modify existing systems to decrease hazardous noise at the source.

=== Path ===
The principle of noise reduction through pathway modifications applies to the alteration of direct and indirect pathways for noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational, and Home Settings|last1=Rawool|first1=Vishakha|date=2012|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-60406-256-4|edition=First|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise that travels across reflective surfaces such as smooth floors can be hazardous. Pathway alterations include sound dampening enclosures for loud equipment and isolation chambers from which workers can remotely control equipment while removed from noise. These methods prevent sound from traveling along a path to the worker or other listener.

=== Receiver ===
In the industrial or commercial setting, workers must comply with the appropriate [[Hearing conservation program]]. [[Administrative controls]] such as the restriction of personnel in noisy areas prevent unnecessary noise exposure. [[Personal protective equipment]] such as foam [[Earplug|ear plugs]] or [[Earmuffs|ear muffs]] to attenuate sound provide a last line of defense for the listener.

== Basic technologies ==
{{see also|Acoustic quieting}}
* [[Sound insulation]]: prevent the transmission of noise by the introduction of a mass barrier. Common materials have high-density properties such as brick, thick glass, concrete, metal etc.
* [[Sound absorption]]:  a porous material which acts as a ‘noise sponge’ by converting the sound energy into heat within the material. Common sound absorption materials include decoupled lead-based tiles, open cell foams and fiberglass
* [[Vibration damping]]: applicable for large vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration energy from the thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common material is sound deadened steel.
* [[Vibration isolation]]: prevents transmission of vibration energy from a source to a receiver by introducing a flexible element or a physical break. Common vibration isolators are springs, rubber mounts, cork etc.

==Roadways==
{{Main|Noise barrier}}
[[File:Geluidscherm Overschie.jpg|thumb|This noise abatement wall in The Netherlands has a transparent section at the driver's eye-level to reduce the visual impact for road users.]]
Source control in [[roadway noise]] has provided little reduction in vehicle noise, except for the development of the [[hybrid vehicle]]; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Highway]] noise is today less affected by [[Engine|motor]] type, since the effects in higher speed are [[aerodynamic]] and [[tire]] noise related.  Other contributions to reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire [[tread]] designs for [[truck]]s in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of [[muffler|unmuffled]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/tire-pavement-noise/|title=Tire-Pavement Noise {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fertile areas for roadway noise mitigation are in urban planning decisions, roadway design, [[noise barrier]] design,&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen and Colin English, ''Environmental Noise Barriers: A Guide to Their Visual and Acoustic Design'', Spon Press, United Kingdom (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-419-23180-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; speed control, surface pavement selection and truck restrictions.  Speed control is effective since the lowest sound emissions arise from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometres per hour.  Above that range, sound emissions double with each five miles per hour of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration noise dominates.

Selection of road surface pavement can make a difference of a factor of two in sound levels, for the speed regime above 30 kilometres per hour.  Quieter pavements are porous with a negative surface texture and use medium to small aggregates; the loudest pavements have a transversely grooved surface, and/or a positive surface texture and use larger aggregates.  Surface friction and roadway safety are important considerations as well for pavement decisions.

When designing new urban freeways or arterials, there are numerous design decisions regarding alignment and roadway geometrics.&lt;ref&gt;Myer Kutz, ''Handbook of Transportation Engineering'',  McGraw-Hill (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-07-139122-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a [[computer model]] to calculate sound levels has become standard practice since the early 1970s. In this way exposure of sensitive receptors to elevated sound levels can be minimized. An analogous process exists for urban [[mass transit]] systems and other rail transportation decisions. Early examples of urban rail systems designed using this technology were: [[Boston]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] line expansions (1970s), [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system expansion (1981), [[Houston]] [[METRORail]] system (1982), and the [[MAX Light Rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]] (1983).

Noise barriers can be applicable for existing or planned surface transportation projects. They are probably the single most effective weapon in retrofitting an existing roadway, and commonly can reduce adjacent land use sound levels by up to ten decibels. A computer model is required to design the barrier since terrain, [[microscale meteorology|micrometeorology]] and other locale specific factors make the endeavor a very complex undertaking. For example, a roadway in cut or strong prevailing winds can produce a setting where atmospheric sound propagation is unfavorable to any noise barrier.

==Aircraft==
{{Main|Aircraft noise}}
[[File:Airbus A321 (British AW) - Aviation noise.jpg|thumb|A [[British Airways]] [[Airbus A321-211|Airbus A321]], on landing approach to London [[Heathrow Airport]], showing proximity to homes.]]

As in the case of roadway noise, little progress has been made in quelling aircraft noise at the source, other than elimination of loud engine designs from the 1960s and earlier.  Because of its velocity and volume, jet turbine engine exhaust noise defies reduction by any simple means.

The most promising forms of aircraft noise abatement are through land planning, flight operations restrictions and residential [[soundproofing]]. Flight restrictions can take the form of preferred runway use, departure flight path and slope, and time-of-day restrictions. These tactics are sometimes controversial since they can impact aircraft safety, flying convenience and airline economics.

In 1979, the [[US Congress]] authorized&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979]] (ASNAA)'', 49 U.S.C. 47501-47510&lt;/ref&gt; the [[FAA]] to devise technology and programs to attempt to insulate homes near airports. While this obviously does not aid the exterior environment, the program has been effective for residential and school interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report for the Aircraft [[Noise Insulation]] Project for [[San Francisco International Airport]]: Phase one Pilot Project'', [[FAA]] funded and prepared for the city of South San Francisco, Earth Metrics Inc., Burlingame, California, July, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]], [[John Wayne International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan and Ballard George, ''Pilot Noise Residential Insulation Program'', [[San Jose International Airport]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; in California.

The underlying technology is a computer model which simulates the propagation of aircraft noise and its penetration into buildings. Variations in aircraft types, flight patterns and local meteorology can be analyzed along with benefits of alternative building [[retrofit]] strategies such as roof upgrading, window [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] improvement, [[fireplace]] baffling, [[caulk]]ing construction seams and other measures. The computer model allows cost effectiveness evaluations of a host of alternative strategies.

In Canada, [[Transport Canada]] prepares noise exposure forecasts (NEF) for each airport, using a computer model similar to that used in the US. Residential land development is discouraged within high impact areas identified by the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Canada [http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/standards/aerodromeairnav-standards-noise-nef-924.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the flight paths in all of [[Scandinavia]] were changed as the new [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo-Gardermoen Airport]] was opened. These new paths were straighter, reducing fuel use, and disturbing fewer people, however, vociferous protests came from people near the new paths who had not been disturbed before, and they took legal action ([[NIMBY]] effect).

==Architectural solutions==

Architectural acoustics noise control practices include: interior sound reverberation reduction, inter-room noise transfer mitigation and exterior building skin augmentation.

In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) [[apartment]]s, [[condominium]]s, [[hospital]]s, and [[hotel]]s, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants.  With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.  The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[A-weighting|dBA]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), [[perforated metal]] (used internally or externally),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=William|title=Perforated metal systems sound absorbing surfaces|journal=Construction Specifier|date=February 2007|url=http://www.ssaacoustics.com/newspublications/perforated%20metal%20systems%20as%20sound%20absorbative%20surf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  roof material, caulking standards, [[chimney]] baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, [[attic]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission.  Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are [[elevator]] systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  [[Aerodynamic]] sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion.  Noise control for aerodynamic sources include [[air nozzle|quiet air nozzles]], [[muffler|pneumatic silencers]] and [[Quiet PC#Fans|quiet fan technology]].  Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards,&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Noise Control in Buildings: A Practical Guide for Architects and Engineers'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically [[Sound transmission class]] of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called Impact Insulation Class (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from [[airborne transmission]], but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above. Low frequency noise is transferred easily through the ground and buildings. This type of noise is more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on [[resilient channel]].

Both of the transmission effects noted above may emanate either from building occupants or from building [[mechanical system]]s such as elevators, plumbing systems or heating, ventilating and air conditioning units.  In some cases it is merely necessary to specify the best available quieting technology in selecting such building hardware.  In other cases shock mounting of systems to control vibration may be in order.  In the case of plumbing systems there are specific protocols developed, especially for water supply lines, to create isolation clamping of pipes within building walls.  In the case of central air systems, it is important to baffle any ducts that could transmit sound between different building areas.

Designing special-purpose rooms has more exotic challenges, since these rooms may have requirements for unusual features such as [[concert]] performance, [[recording studio|sound studio recording]], lecture halls.  In these cases [[reverberation]] and reflection must be analyzed in order to not only quiet the rooms, but to prevent echo effects from occurring.  In these situations special [[sound baffle]]s and sound absorptive lining materials may be specified to dampen unwanted effects.

===Materials===
Acoustical wall and ceiling panels can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. The ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate.  Fabric covered panels are one way to maximize the acoustical absorption. The finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or Micore, is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or metal. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a "pre-fabricated panel" if laid onto a wall, and require no modifications. Such fabrics are generally acoustically 'transparent, meaning that they do not impede a sound wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technature.ca Technature Inc. | Acoustic Products &amp; Soundproofing Materials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the subas "on-site acoustical wall panels" This is constructed by "framing" the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to work around door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally greater than 50 feet) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method.

Double-glazed and thicker windows can also prevent sound transmission from the outdoors.

==Industrial==
{{Main|Industrial noise}}
Industrial noise is traditionally associated with manufacturing settings where industrial machinery produces intense sound levels,&lt;ref&gt;Randall F Barron and Barron F Barron, ''[[Industrial noise|Industrial Noise]] Control and Acoustics'', Marcel Dekker, New York (2002) {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; often upwards of 85 decibels.  While this circumstance is the most dramatic, there are many other work environments where sound levels may lie in the range of 70 to 75 decibels, entirely composed of office equipment, music, public address systems, and even exterior noise intrusion. Either type of environment may result in [[noise health effects]] if the sound intensity and exposure time is too great.

In the case of industrial equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of [[acrylic glass]] or other solid barriers, and provision of [[earplug|ear protection equipment]]. In certain cases the machinery itself can be re-designed to operate in a manner less prone to produce grating, grinding, frictional, or other motions that induce sound emissions. In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of more conventional office environments, the techniques in architectural acoustics discussed above may apply. Other solutions may involve researching the quietest models of office equipment, particularly printers and photocopy machines.  [[Impact printer]]s and other equipment were often fitted with "acoustic hoods", enclosures to reduce emitted noise. One source of annoying, if not loud, sound level emissions are lighting fixtures (notably older fluorescent globes).  These fixtures can be retrofitted or analyzed to see whether [[over-illumination]] is present, a common office environment issue. If over-illumination is occurring, de-lamping or reduced light bank usage may apply. Photographers can quieten noisy still cameras on a film set using [[sound blimp]]s.

==Commercial==
Reductions in cost of technology have allowed noise control technology to be used not only in performance facilities and recording studios, but also in noise-sensitive small businesses such as restaurants.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |title=High-tech system lets restaurant set noise level |last=Finz |first=Stacy |date=May 13, 2012 |website=San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I9oil12S?url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |archivedate=July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustically absorbent materials such as fiberglass duct liner, wood fiber panels and recycled denim jeans serve as artwork-bearing canvasses in environments in which aesthetics are important.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

Using a combination of sound absorption materials, arrays of microphones and speakers, and a digital processor, a restaurant operator can use a tablet computer to selectively control noise levels at different places in the restaurant: the microphone arrays pick up sound and send it to the digital processor, which controls the speakers to output sound signals on command.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Communities may use zoning codes to isolate noisy urban activities from areas that should be protected from such unhealthy exposures and to establish noise standards in areas that may not be conducive to such isolation strategies. Because low-income neighborhoods are often at greater risk of noise pollution, the establishment of such zoning codes is often an environmental justice issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Identifying the Vulnerable Groups|url = http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/issues/vulnerable-groups.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed use areas present especially difficult conflicts that require special attention to the need to protect people from the harmful effects of noise pollution.  Noise is generally one consideration in an [[environmental impact statement]], if applicable (such as transportation system construction).

The '''Oeschger Centre for Climate and Climate Change Research''' ('''OCCR'''), is the interdisciplinary centre of excellence for climate research of the [[University of Bern]].

== History ==
[[File:icecore 4x.jpg|frame|right|Ice core sample taken from drill. Photo by [[Lonnie Thompson]], [[Byrd Polar Research Center]]]]

The centre was established in 2007 and was named after [[Hans Oeschger]] (1927-1998), a pioneer of modern [[climate research]], who worked in [[Bern]]. The OCCR brings together researchers from nine institutes and four faculties. It has more than 200 members working in 26 research groups. The OCCR is at the forefront of international research in a number of different fields. Researchers from the University of Bern have participated as co-chair, coordinating lead authors or lead authors in all the assessment reports so far published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml#1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Assessment Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are still working today at the OCCR. In addition to research within disciplines, the OCCR puts special emphasis on interdisciplinary projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documentation/oeschger_broch_en.pdf Oeschger Centre Booklet]&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally rooted and globally linked, the OCCR hopes to find ways to meet the challenge of [[global climate change]] at many different levels through the collaboration of experts in the natural, human and social sciences, in economics and law. The OCCR is active not only in research; it is also involved in teaching and runs the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

== Overview ==

=== Research ===
The Oeschger Centre (OCCR) conducts research on the one hand into the long-term development and dynamics of the climate system and the climate of the present and the future. On the other hand, it investigates the impact of climate change on important land ecosystems as well as on the economy and society. In particular it works on strategies to adapt to the changing climate and to slow down climate change. At the centre of the OCCR's research is the climate system and its interaction with society and the economy.

Specific areas of research include:
* the climate system with its different interactive components in the oceans, continents (especially vegetation, the [[cryosphere]], aquatic systems, etc.) and in the atmosphere
* energy and material cycles (e.g. water, carbon and greenhouse gases) from the global to the local level.
* the dynamics of the climate and environment over long periods of time ([[palaeoclimatology]], [[palaeoecology]]) from the late [[Pleistocene]], [[Holocene]] and the present day to the near future
* the interaction of changes in the climate and environment with the economy and society, in particular the economics of climate change and the consequences of extreme events on the economy and society

The Oeschger Centre uses models of varying kinds and complexity, and also takes measurements and carries out reconstructions of important climate variables (e.g. natural and man-made radiative forcing).

=== Teaching ===
The Oeschger Centre runs the University of Bern's Graduate School of Climate Sciences &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/ Graduate School of Climate Sciences Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; and offers academic training to MSc and PhD level. For the specialist "MSc in Climate Sciences" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html Documents and Guidelines «MSc in Climate Sciences»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220011009/http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html |date=2012-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (120 ECTS), applicants have to pass through a selection process. Students put together their own curriculum by selecting courses from a range of topics offered by several different faculties. The selection can lead to any one of five specialisations. The OCCR's main areas of research are reflected in the curriculum of the courses offered by the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

The Oeschger Centre has a decidedly international outlook in its teaching, and works closely with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. More than a third of its students come from abroad, and all teaching is conducted in English. The PhD programme is strongly research-orientated, and lasts for three to four years. Students with a degree from the Graduate School of Climate Sciences may take up academic careers, work in the private sector – for example in banks or in insurance – or in the environmental sector for the government or with non-governmental organisations.

== Structure ==

=== Organisation ===
The Oeschger Centre for Climate Research (OCCR) is an interdisciplinary centre at the University of Bern, made up of research groups from the participating institutes. Administratively it is part of the Faculty of Science. The OCCR received its mandate from the university's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documents/LA20080129.pdf University of Bern, mandate of the governing body (German Only)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The president, director and a scientific committee made up of representatives of the participating faculties and institutes are responsible for the strategic management of the OCCR. The OCCR is run by a management centre which encourages collaboration between the research groups,  provides services for the researchers and publicises the work of the OCCR.

'''Papal diplomatics''' is the scholarly and critical study ([[diplomatics]]) of the authentic documents of the [[Papacy]], largely to distinguish them from spurious documents. The study emerges in the Middle Ages and has been further refined in the centuries since. 

==History==

The authenticity of [[papal Bull]]s, alongside royal charters and other legal instruments, became a matter of concern in the Middle Ages. The [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|Papal Chancery]] oversaw control of documents and precautions taken against forgery. [[Pope Gregory VII]] refrained even from attaching the usual leaden seal to a Bull for fear it should fall into unscrupulous hands and be used for fraudulent purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Dubitavimus hic sigillum plumbeum ponere ne si illud inimici caperent de eo falsitatem aliquam facerent. - Jaffé-Löwenfeld, "Regesta", no. 5225; cf. no. 5242.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Pope Innocent III]] issued instructions with a view to the detection of forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;See Migne, ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CCXIV, 202, 322, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; An ecclesiastic of the standing of [[Lanfranc]] has been seriously accused of conniving at the fabrication of Bulls,&lt;ref&gt;H. Böhmer, "Die Fälschungen Erzbischof Lanfranks", 1902; cf. Liebermann's review in "Deutsche Literaturzeitung", 1902, p. 2798, and the defence of Lanfrane by L. Saltet in "Bulletin de litt. eccl.", Toulouse, 1907, 227 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the need of some system of tests became obvious.

But the medieval criticism of documents was not very satisfactory even in the hands of a jurist like [[Pope Alexander III]].&lt;ref&gt;See his comments on two pretended privileges of Popes Zacharias and Leo, Jaffé-Löwenfeld, "Regesta", no. 11,896.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Laurentius Valla]], the humanist, was right in denouncing the [[Donation of Constantine]], and though the [[Magdeburg Centuriator]], [[Matthias Flacius]], was right in attacking the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], their methods, in themselves, were often crude and inconclusive. The modern discipline of [[diplomatics]] really dates only from the time of the Benedictine Dom [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707), whose fundamental work, ''De Re Diplomatica'' (Paris, 1681), was written to correct the principles advocated in the criticism of ancient documents by the [[Bollandist]], [[Daniel Papebroch]].

Scholars including [[Barthélemy Germon]] (1663–1718) and [[Jean Hardouin]] in France, and, to a lesser degree, [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] in England, rejected Mabillon's criteria; but all that has been done since Mabillon's time has been to develop his methods and occasionally to modify his judgements upon some point of detail. After the issue of a ''Supplement'' in 1704, a second, enlarged and improved edition of the ''De Re Diplomatica'' was prepared by Mabillon himself and published in 1709, after his death, by his pupil [[Thierry Ruinart]]. This pioneer work had not extended to any documents later than the thirteenth century and had taken no account of certain classes of papers, such as the ordinary letters of the popes and privileges of a more private character. Two other [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists, [[Dom Toustain]] and [[Dom Tassin]], compiled a work in six large quarto volumes, with many facsimiles etc., known as the ''Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique'' (Paris, 1750–1765). It was a small advance on Mabillon's own treatise, but was widely used; and was presented in a more summary form by [[François Jean de Vaines]], and others.

With the exception of some useful works directed at particular countries,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Maffei]], ''Istoria diplomatica'' (Mantua, 1727), unfinished; and [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori|Muratori]], "De Diplomatibus Antiquis", included in his ''Antiquitates Italicae'' (1740), vol. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; as also the treatise of [[Luigi Gaetano Marini]] on papyrus documents,&lt;ref&gt;''I papiri diplomatici'' (Rome, 1805)&lt;/ref&gt; no great advance was made in the science for a century and a half after Mabillon's death. The ''Dictionnaire raisonné de diplomatique chrétienne'' by [[Maximilien Quantin]], which forms part of Migne's ''Encyclopedia'', is a digest of older works; and the sumptuous ''Eléments de paléographie'' of [[de Wailly]] (2 vols, 1838) has little independent merit.
 
In the second half of the 19th century the field was active, with the names of [[Léopold Delisle]], the chief librarian of the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, [[M. de Mas-Latrie]], professor at the Ecole de Chartres, and [[Julius von Pflugk-Harttung]], the editor of a series of facsimiles of papal Bulls. A calendar of early papal Bulls began appearing from 1902, the results of researches of P. Kehr, A. Brackmann, and W. Wiederhold, in ''Nachrichten der Göttingen Gesellsehaft der Wissenschaften''. [[Papal regesta]] were published, especially by members of the [[Ecole Française de Rome]].

==Subject-matter==

Officials concerned with the preparation of the documents collectively formed the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|Chancery]]. The constitution of the Chancery, which in the case of the [[Holy See]] seems to date back to a ''[[Notarius|schola notariorum]]'', with a ''[[primicerius]]'' at its head, of which we hear under [[Pope Julius I]] (337–352), varied from period to period, and the part played by the different officials composing it necessarily varied also. Besides the Holy See, each bishop also had some sort of chancery for the issue of his own episcopal Acts. The procedure of the Chancery is only a study preparatory to the examination of the document itself.

Secondly, we have the text of the document. As the position of the Holy See became more fully recognized, the business of the Chancery increased, and there arose a marked tendency to adhere strictly to the forms prescribed by traditional usage. Various collections of these formulae, of which the ''Liber Diurnus'' is one of the most ancient, were compiled at an early date. Many others will be found in the ''Recueil général des formules'' of Eugène de Rozière (Paris, 1861–1871), though these, like the series published by [[Zeumer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Formulae Merovingici et Karolini aevi'' (Hanover, 1886)&lt;/ref&gt; are mainly secular in character.

After the text of the document, which of course varies according to its nature, and in which not merely the wording but also the rhythm (the so-called ''cursus'') has often to be considered, attention must be paid:

* to the manner of dating
* to the signatures
* to the attestations of witnesses etc.
* to the seals and the attachment of the seals ([[sigillography]])
* to the material upon which it is written and to the manner of folding
* to the handwriting (including the science of [[palaeography]]).

All these matters fall within the scope of diplomatics, and all offer different tests for the authenticity of any given document. There are other details which often need to be considered, for example the [[Tironian notes]] (or shorthand), which are of not infrequent occurrence in primitive ''[[Urkunden]]'', both papal and imperial.&lt;ref&gt;See Tangl, "Die tironischen Noten", in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'' (1907), vol. 1, pp. 87-166.&lt;/ref&gt; A special section in any comprehensive study of diplomatics is also likely to be devoted to spurious documents: the number is surprisingly great.

Important characteristics of a POID are that it does not carry business information and are not generally exported or otherwise made visible to data users; as such a POID has many of the characteristics of a [[surrogate key]].  The only purpose of the POID is to act as the primary key on the table where it is defined and to be referenced as the [[foreign key]] by other tables.

'''Pervasive informatics''' is the study of how information affects interactions with the built environments they occupy. The term and concept were initially introduced by Professor [[Kecheng Liu]] during a keynote speech at the SOLI 2008 international conference.&lt;ref name="Keynote"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu|Liu, K.]] [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4686343&amp;tag=1"], ''Pervasive informatics in intelligent spaces for living and working'', Keynote, IEEE international Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics 2009, xviii –xix”&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|reason=This does not show the term was first established there|date=October 2015}}

The built environment is rich with information which can be utilised by its occupants to enhance the quality of their work and life. By introducing ICT systems, this information can be created, managed, distributed and consumed more effectively, leading to more advanced interactions between users and the environment. The social interactions in these spaces are of additional value, and Informatics can effectively capture the complexities of such information rich activities.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; Information literally pervades, or spreads throughout, these socio-technical systems, and pervasive informatics aims to study, and assist in the design of, pervasive information environments, or pervasive spaces, for the benefit of their stakeholders and users.

== Pervasive computing ==
Pervasive informatics may be initially viewed as simply another branch of [[Pervasive Computing|pervasive]], or [[ubiquitous computing]]. However, pervasive informatics places a greater emphasis on the ICT-enhanced socio-technical pervasive spaces, as opposed to the technology driven direction of pervasive computing. This distinction between fields is analogous to that of  [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and  [[computing]], where Informatics focuses on the study of information, while the primary concern of computing is the processing of information. Pervasive informatics aims to analyse the pervasive nature of information, examining its various representations and transformations in pervasive spaces, which are enabled by pervasive computing technologies e.g. [[smart device]]s and intelligent control systems.

== Pervasive spaces ==
A pervasive space is characterised by the physical and informational interaction between the occupants and the built environment e.g. the act of controlling the building is a physical interaction, while the space responding to this action/user instruction is an informational interaction. 

Intelligent pervasive spaces are those that display intelligent behaviour in the form of adaptation to user requirements or the environment itself. Such intelligent behaviour can be implemented using artificial intelligence algorithms and agent-based technologies. These intelligent spaces aim to provide communication and computing services to their occupants in such a way that the experience is almost transparent e.g. automated control of heating and ventilation based on occupant preference profiles.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

The term first appeared in an IBM Research Report &lt;ref&gt;Mcfaddin, S., D. Coffman et al.[http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/A164F52F0FE2A3DD85257379005811FE/$File/rc24381.pdf"], ''Celadon: Delivering Business Services to Mobile Users in Public Spaces'', IBM Research Report, RC24381.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not properly defined or discussed until later. An intelligent pervasive space is a “social and physical space with enhanced capability through ICT for human to interact with the built environments” &lt;ref name="Keynote" /&gt; An alternative definition is “an adaptable and dynamic area that optimises user services and management processes using information systems and networked ubiquitous technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/12316/"], ''Ubiquitous Monitoring and Behavioural Change: A Semiotic Perspective''. 11th International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations (ICISO). Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China: 449-456”&lt;/ref&gt; A common point between these definitions is that pervasive computing technologies are the means by which intelligence and interactions are achieved in pervasive spaces, with the purpose of enhancing a users experience.

== Theories and techniques ==
Historically, there have been few attempts to consolidate approaches to studying the complex interplay between occupants and the built environment, and to assist in the design of pervasive information environments.  Many theoretical interdisciplinary approaches are relevant to the design of effective pervasive spaces. A core concept in pervasive informatics is the range of interactions that may occur in pervasive spaces: people to people, people to the physical and the physical space to technological artefacts such as sensors. In order to study these interactions it is necessary to have an understanding of what information is being created and exchanged.  In light of this, a series of theories which enable us to consider both social and technological interactions together form the foundations of pervasive informatics &lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu |Liu, K.]], Nakata, K. and Harty, C. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00002"], ''Pervasive informatics: theory, practice and future directions.'' Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 5-19(15)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STS ===
[[Socio-technical systems]] provide an approach which assists in understanding and supporting the use of pervasive technologies. The space could be considered as a network of artefacts, information, technology and occupants. By adopting STS approaches, a means for dynamically investigating and mapping such networks becomes possible.

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] can be used to explain how information is passed and processed, with a focus on both interactions between people, in addition to their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref name="hollan"&gt;Hollan, J., HUtchins, E. and Krish, D. [http://cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/Winter10/231/readings/2A-HollanHutchinsKirsh-DCOG-TOCHI.pdf"], Distributed Cognition: Toward a New
Foundation for Human-Computer
Interaction Research. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000, Pages 174–196.&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions are analysed in terms of the trajectories of information.

=== CSCW ===
Human interactions with a space, and its effect on coordination mechanisms have been examined in the field of [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). The concepts of [[media space]]s&lt;ref name="gaver"&gt;Gaver, W., [http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031918/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf |date=2012-03-25 }}, ''The Affordances of Media Spaces for Collaboration''. In Proceedings of CSCW'92 (Toronto)&lt;/ref&gt; and awareness have also emerged from CSCW which are of relevance to pervasive informatics.

=== Semiotics ===
[[Semiotics]], the study of signs, can be used to assess the effectiveness of a built environment from six different levels: physical, empirical, syntactical, semantic, pragmatic and social. Semiotics enables us to understand the nature and characteristics of sign-based interactions in pervasive spaces.

== Trend and future research ==
The current technology-centred view of pervasive computing is no longer sufficient for studying the information in the built environment. Socio-technical approaches are required to direct attention to the interaction between the built environment and its occupants. 
The concept of pervasive informatics then captures this shift, and enables current research efforts in different fields to converge their focus and consolidate their methods under one label, leading to a better direction and understanding of this complex domain. Research issues identified for further study in pervasive informatics: 

*Understanding the impacts of intelligent pervasive spaces and enabling technologies on occupants &lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00005"], ''Analysing the factors affecting users in intelligent pervasive spaces'', Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 57-71”&lt;/ref&gt;
*Designing organisations as pervasive information systems—the role of information and artefacts in communication and interaction.
*Context-dependent information and knowledge management, towards effective decision support in pervasive spaces.
*Service-oriented design of intelligent buildings as adaptive and learning information spaces with regards to norms and emerging practices in intelligent pervasive spaces.
*Through-life intelligent support in building management, with a better understanding of the lifecycle of pervasive spaces from the conception, design, implementation, utilisation till recycling to achieve the building performance and sustainability.

The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but they all address the issues that lie on the boundaries between the physical, informational and social-capturing the essence of pervasive spaces.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

'''Postdevelopment theory''' (also '''post-development''' or '''anti-development''' or '''development criticism''') holds that the whole concept and practice of [[regional development|development]] is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and [[development theory]], which justified them.

==Development as ideology==
The postdevelopment critique holds that modern [[development theory]] is a creation of academia in tandem with an underlying political and economic ideology. The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory.

The actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore ''socially constructed''; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony.

Development as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world.

==Reviewing development==
Influenced by [[Ivan Illich]] and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Gustavo Esteva]] have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as "advanced" and "progressive", and the South as "backward", "degenerate" and "primitive".

They point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President [[Harry Truman]]'s declaration: "The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truman Inaugural Address, January 20, 1949|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/50yr_archive/inagural20jan1949.htm|website=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While claiming that the "era of development" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What ''was'' new was the definition of  development in terms of an escape from [[underdevelopment]]. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of "underdevelopment", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation.

Development, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war [[American hegemony]]; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else.

==Post-development theory==
Post-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], [[Gustavo Esteva]], [[Majid Rahnema]], [[Wolfgang Sachs]], [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], [[Serge Latouche]], and [[Gilbert Rist]]. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to [[Wolfgang Sachs]], a leading member of the post-development school, "the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape" and "it is time to dismantle this mental structure."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Sachs, "Introduction" in Sachs 1992: 1-5, citation p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To cite an example of this "mental structure", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development.

===Critique of ethnocentrism and universalism===
Among the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world's population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide)  of indigenous culture&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Futures: learning from Ladakh'' by Helena Norberg-Hodge. Sierra Club Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves.

[[Majid Rahnema]] cites [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]]: "To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in [[Ladakh]] when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'"&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, "Poverty" in: Sachs 1992: 158-176, citation p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema also refers to Peter Bunyard, "Can Self-sufficient Communities survive the onslaught of Development?", The Ecologist, Vol. 14, 1984, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Development is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule.  Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities.

For example, the politics of defining and satisfying [[needs]] is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development "experts" (the [[World Bank]], IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns.

Postdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented.

===Alternatives to development===
While the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economic influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies.

In his works, [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Escobar]] has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in "local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements." Grassroots movements, Escobar argues, are "local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment." ([https://books.google.at/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M0NRDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=arturo+escobar+designs+for+the+pluriverse&amp;ots=NzHTavKElr&amp;sig=4ypQm3eI3YI89k-4LshndRAXp7E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arturo%20escobar%20designs%20for%20the%20pluriverse&amp;f=false Escobar, 2017])

Post-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge.

===James Ferguson===
{{Further|James Ferguson (anthropologist)}}
One of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed "the most important of the opening salvos" of post-development theory with his book ''The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho''. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'' Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that "Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureacratic Power in Lesotho|journal=The Ecologist|date=September–October 1994|volume=24|issue=5|pages=176–181|url=http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/read/resurgence/ecologist-vol-24-no-5-sep-oct-1994-6241/18/3|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences.

Ferguson suggests that although development projects often end in failure, they still produce tangible impacts in the physical and social-political environment. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'', he asks, "What do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?"&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; In the case of Lesotho, Ferguson proposes that, "while the project did not transform livestock-keeping it did build a road to link to Thaba-Tsea more strongly with the capital."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; Ferguson argues that there is value to understanding and thinking about the [[unintended consequences]] for an environment.

===Arturo Escobar===
{{Further|Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)}}
Critics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majid Rahnema===
{{Further|Majid Rahnema}}
Majid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the ''Post-Development Reader''. Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the "end of development". He says that the end of development is not "An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity". Rather, Rahnema argues, the "inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Serge Latouche===
{{Further|Serge Latouche}}
Serge Latouche is a [[French people|French]] [[emeritus]] [[professor]] in economy at the [[University of Paris-Sud]]. A  specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces [[economism]], [[utilitarianism]] in social sciences, [[Consumerism|consumer society]] and the notion of [[sustainable development]]. He particularly criticizes the notions of [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic rationalism]]. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the [[Degrowth|degrowth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170033/http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche |date=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latouche has also published in the [[Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales|Revue de Mauss]], a French anti-utilitarian journal.

===Wolfgang Sachs and ''The Development Dictionary''===
{{Further|Wolfgang Sachs}}
Wolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited ''The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power'' which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory.

This manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of "underdevelopment" was actually constructed in [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address]], which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. "It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Wolfgang|title=The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Development Dictionary'' describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the "natural order of things" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production.

Sachs issues a cry for public awareness of the "limits of development." He leaves the reader with the idea of the "New Commons" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths.

==Criticisms==

There is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents.  It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West.  This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Marc|title=Peasants Against Globalization: Rural Social Movements in Costa Rica|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804734011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing Jonathan Crush's point that "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crush|first=Jonathan|title=Power of Development|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11176-8|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Kiely argues that "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Nohle Savage? A Critical Assessment of Post-Development Theory|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=1 June 1999|volume=11|issue=1|pages=30–55|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=395bfdd5-ba80-4be4-a31c-e338a540617e%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1080/09578819908426726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains.  Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.

There are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of ''all development'' is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be "post- development". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject.

Critics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism.  Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications.  John Rapley points out that "rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapley|first=John|title=Development studies and the post-development critique|journal=Progress in Development Studies|date=1 October 2004|volume=4 | issue = 4|pages=350–354|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218128258|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1191/1464993404ps095pr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that "The argument — upheld by [[Dependency theory|dependency]] and post-development theory — that the [[First World]] needs the [[Third World]], and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=Development Theory and Industrialisation: Beyond the Impasse|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|year=1994|volume=24|issue=2|pages=133–160|doi=10.1080/00472339480000101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Noble Savage?

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

===Biblical===
{{Main|Bechor}}
[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= |page=145 |doi=10.2307/845880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where  nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Holly |year=1997 |title=Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia:" Ancient Feudal Restraints" and Revolutionary Reform |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=307–346 |jstor=2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004), p 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble titles==
===Spain===
In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.
}}

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">In the fields of [[bibliography]] and [[bookselling]], '''prize books''' (also known as '''prize bindings'''), are a category of finely bound books once given as prizes and awards in educational institutions primarily in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=John |date= September 1989|title=Reviewed Work: Gold-Tooled Bookbindings Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin in the Eighteenth Century. (Studies in the History of Irish Bookbinding: 1) by Joseph McDonnell and Patrick Healy |url= |journal= The Burlington Magazine  |volume=131  |issue=1038  |pages=656–657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental [[Europe]] from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or [[bookplates]].

==History in UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the [[humanities]] published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local [[bindery]] to prepare prize editions stamped or [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of [[call number]], and general higher quality of the binding.

[[File:Revetment 2.png|thumb|300px|right|{{center|Asphalt and sandbag revetment with a [[geotextile]] filter}}]]

In [[stream restoration]], [[river engineering]] or [[coastal engineering]], '''revetments''' are sloping structures placed on banks or cliffs in such a way as to absorb the energy of incoming [[water]].  In [[military engineering]] they are structures, again sloped, formed to secure an area from artillery, bombing, or stored explosives.  River or coastal revetments are usually built to preserve the existing uses of the shoreline and to protect the slope, as defense against [[erosion]].

==Freshwater revetments==

[[File:Liliw,Lagunajf5551 01.JPG|thumb|right|Revetment along Oples River ([[Liliw, Laguna]])]]

Many revetments are used to line the banks of freshwater [[rivers]], [[lake]]s, and man-made [[reservoirs]], especially to prevent damage during periods of [[floods]] or heavy seasonal rains (see [[riprap]]).  Many materials may be used: wooden piles, loose-piled boulders&lt;ref&gt;Lake Ontario Riparian Alliance.

Concrete revetments are the most common type of infrastructure used to control the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mississippi-river-infrastructure/|title=The struggle to control the Mississippi can help us understand the U.S.|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than {{Convert|1000|miles|km}} of concrete matting has been placed in river bends between [[Cairo, Illinois]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to slow the natural erosion that would otherwise frequently change small parts of the river's course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Revetments as coastal defence==
Revetments are used as a low-cost solution for coastal erosion defence in areas where crashing waves may otherwise deplete the coastline. Wooden revetments are made of planks laid against wooden frames so that they disrupt the force of the water. Although once popular, the use of wooden revetments has largely been replaced by modern concrete-based defence structures such as [[Tetrapod (structure)|tetrapods]].

{{main|Tetrapod (structure)}}

In coastal engineering, a tetrapod is a four-legged [[concrete]] structure used as armour unit on [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s. The tetrapod's shape is designed to dissipate the force of incoming waves by allowing water to flow around rather than against it, and to reduce displacement by allowing a random distribution of tetrapods to mutually interlock.

According to the U.S. [[National Park Service]], and referring mostly to their employment in the [[American Civil War]], a revetment is defined as a "[[retaining wall]] constructed to support the interior slope of a [[parapet]]. Made of logs, wood planks, fence rails, [[fascine]]s, [[gabion]]s, hurdles, sods, or stones, the revetment provided additional protection from enemy fire, and, most importantly, kept the interior slope nearly vertical. Stone revetments commonly survive. A few log revetments have been preserved due to high resin pine or cypress and porous sandy soils. After an [[Fortification|entrenchment]] was abandoned, many log or rail revetments were scavenged for other uses, causing the interior slope to slump more quickly.  An interior slope will appear more vertical if the parapet eroded with the revetment still in place."&lt;ref name=NPS-MILITARY-EARTHWORK-TERMS&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Viking 5C rocketengine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Viking (rocket engine)|Viking 5C rocket engine]] ]]

A '''rocket engine''' uses stored [[rocket propellant]] mass for forming its high-speed propulsive [[Jet (fluid)|jet]]. Rocket engines are [[reaction engine]]s, obtaining thrust in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. Most rocket engines use combustion, although non-combusting forms (such as [[cold gas thruster]]s) also exist. Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called [[rocket]]s. Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can perform in a [[vacuum]] and thus can be used to propel [[spacecraft]] and [[ballistic missile]]s.

Compared to other types of jet engines, rocket engines are by far the lightest, and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest [[specific impulse]]). The ideal exhaust is [[hydrogen]], the lightest of all gases, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity. Rocket engines become more efficient at high velocities, due to greater [[propulsive efficiency]] and the [[Oberth effect]]. Since they do not require an atmosphere, they are well suited for uses at very high altitudes and in space.

==Terminology==
Here, "rocket" is used as an abbreviation for "rocket engine".

'''[[Thermal rocket]]s''' use an inert propellant, heated by a power source such as [[Electrothermal propulsion|electric]] or [[nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear power]].

'''Chemical rockets''' are powered by [[exothermic]] chemical reactions of the propellant:

*'''[[Solid-fuel rocket]]s''' (or '''solid-propellant rockets''' or '''motors''') are chemical rockets which use propellant in a solid state.
*'''[[Liquid-propellant rocket]]s''' use one or more liquid propellants fed from tanks.
*'''[[Hybrid rocket]]s''' use a solid propellant in the combustion chamber, to which a second liquid or gas [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] or propellant is added to permit combustion.
*'''[[Monopropellant rocket]]s''' use a single propellant decomposed by a [[catalyst]]. The most common monopropellants are [[hydrazine]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

4. The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.&lt;br&gt;
5. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]
Rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust [[fluid]] which has been accelerated to a high speed through a [[propelling nozzle]]. The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure ({{convert|10|to|200|bar|psi|order=flip|adj=on}}) combustion of solid or liquid [[Rocket propellant|propellants]], consisting of [[fuel]] and [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] components, within a [[combustion chamber]]. The nozzle uses the heat energy released by expansion of the gas to accelerate the exhaust to very high ([[supersonic]]) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction. Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance, permitting a longer nozzle, giving higher exhaust speeds and better thermodynamic efficiency.

An alternative to combustion is the [[water rocket]], which uses water pressurised by compressed air, [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], or manual pumping, for [[model rocket]]ry.

===Propellant===
Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.

Chemical rocket propellants are most commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes. Alternatively, a chemically inert [[reaction mass]] can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger, and then no combustion chamber is used.

[[Solid rocket]] propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called 'grain' and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.

===Injection===
[[Liquid rocket|Liquid-fuelled rockets]] force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn. [[Hybrid rocket]] engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants. Both liquid and hybrid rockets use ''[[Liquid-fuel rocket#Injectors|injectors]]'' to introduce the propellant into the chamber. These are often an array of simple [[jet (nozzle)|jet]]s - holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles. When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.

===Combustion chamber===
{{main article|Combustion chamber}}
For chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically just a cylinder, and [[flame holder]]s are rarely used.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different [[rocket propellant]]s require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.

This leads to a number called &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt;:{{cn|date=August 2018}}
:&lt;math&gt;L^* = \frac {V_c} {A_t}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the chamber
*&lt;math&gt;A_t&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the throat
L* is typically in the range of {{convert|25|-|60|in|m}}.

The combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standard. Unlike in [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, and the propellant mixture can reach true [[stoichiometric]] ratios. This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In order for fuel and oxidizer to flow into the chamber, the pressure of the propellant fluids entering the combustion chamber must exceed the pressure inside the combustion chamber itself.  This may be accomplished by a variety of design approaches including [[turbopump]]s or, in simpler engines, via [[Pressure-fed cycle (rocket)|sufficient tank pressure]] to advance fluid flow. Tank pressure may be maintained by several means, including a high-pressure [[helium]] pressurization system common to many large rocket engines or, in some newer rocket systems, by a bleed-off of high-pressure gas from the engine cycle to [[autogenous pressurization|autogenously pressurize]] the propellant tanks&lt;ref name=nsf20160927&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;  For example, the self-pressurization gas system of the &lt;!-- on both the initial ITS launch vehicle design (2016) and the later BFR design in 2017, for the Raptor methalox engine --&gt;[[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two in BFR, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas [[reaction control system|reaction-control thrusters]].&lt;ref name=nsf20161003/&gt;

===Nozzle===
{{Main article|Rocket engine nozzle}}
[[File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting in the combustion chamber and nozzle. From Newton's third law, equal and opposite pressures act on the exhaust, and this accelerates it to high speeds.]]
The hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the "throat"), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle ''[[choked flow|choke]]s'' and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the [[speed of sound]] in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]]) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.

{{Anchor|opt_expansion}} &lt;!-- add anchor for diagram references ---&gt;
[[File:Rocket nozzle expansion.svg|thumb|right|upright|The four expansion regimes of a de Laval nozzle:&lt;br&gt;
• under-expanded&lt;br&gt;
• perfectly expanded&lt;br&gt;
• over-expanded&lt;br&gt;
• grossly over-expanded]]
The most commonly used nozzle is the [[de Laval nozzle]], a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.

The exit [[static pressure#Static pressure in fluid dynamics|static pressure]] of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle. As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be
* '''under-expanded''' (exit pressure greater than ambient),
* '''perfectly expanded''' (exit pressure equals ambient),
* '''over-expanded''' (exit pressure less than ambient; [[shock diamond]]s form outside the nozzle), or
* '''grossly over-expanded''' (a [[shock wave]] forms inside the nozzle extension).

In practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero. If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs. Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle. Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude. Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter K Huzel and David H. Huang (1971), [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710019929_1971019929.pdf NASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines] &amp;nbsp;Second edition of a technical report obtained from the website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).

====Back pressure and optimal expansion====
For optimal performance the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.

To maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the [[plug nozzle]], [[stepped nozzles]], the [[expanding nozzle]] and the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.

When exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise. One is the sheer weight of the nozzle—beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained. Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing 'snow' within the jet. This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.

On a [[de Laval nozzle]], exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle.  As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine. This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.

Advanced [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude-compensating]] designs, such as the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] or [[plug nozzle]], attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.

===Propellant efficiency===
{{see also|Specific impulse}}
[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright|Typical temperature (T), pressure (p), and velocity (v) profiles in a de Laval Nozzle]]
For a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust. This can be achieved by all of:

*heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as [[aluminium]], or even using nuclear energy)
*using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)
*using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity

Since all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from [[Newton's third law]] the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional). However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency. This is termed ''exhaust velocity'', and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the '''[[effective exhaust velocity]]''' is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc. are usually also very important).

For aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic ("[[Choked flow|chokes]]") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the 'throat'. Since the [[speed of sound]] in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340&amp;nbsp;m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700&amp;nbsp;m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.

Expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly [[collimated]] hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio—the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.

===Thrust vectoring===
{{main article|Thrust vectoring}}
Vehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn. A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:

*The entire engine is mounted on a [[hinge]] or [[gimbal]] and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.
*Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.
*Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.
*High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.

==Overall performance==
Rocket technology can combine very high thrust ([[meganewton]]s), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (&gt;100) ''simultaneously'' as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.

Rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.

===Specific impulse===
{{Specific impulse|align=right}}
{{Main article|Specific impulse}}

The most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] per unit of [[propellant]], this is called [[specific impulse]] (usually written &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;). This is either measured as a speed (the ''effective exhaust velocity'' &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt; in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). An engine that gives a large specific impulse is normally highly desirable.

The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.

===Net thrust===
{{main article|Thrust}}
Below is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 2-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = \dot{m}\;v_{e} = \dot{m}\;v_{e-opt} + A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})&lt;/math&gt;

|align=left|=&amp;nbsp; ambient (or atmospheric) pressure
|}

Since, unlike a jet engine, a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}\;v_{e-opt}\,&lt;/math&gt; term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the &lt;math&gt;A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})\,&lt;/math&gt; term represents the pressure thrust term. At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases. At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%,depending on the engine design. This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.

Maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust. This occurs when &lt;math&gt;p_{e} = p_{amb}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.

===Vacuum specific impulse, I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;===

Due to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful. Because rockets [[choked flow|choke]] at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained. It is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 3-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_{vac} = C_f\, \dot{m}\, c^*&lt;/math&gt;

and so define the ''vacuum Isp'' to be:

:&lt;math&gt;v_{evac} = C_f\, c^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;= &amp;thinsp;the speed of sound constant at the throat
:&lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;= &amp;thinsp;the thrust coefficient constant of the nozzle (typically about 2)

And hence:
:&lt;math&gt; F_n = \dot{m}\, v_{evac} - A_{e}\, p_{amb}&lt;/math&gt;

===Throttling===

Rockets can be throttled by controlling the propellant combustion rate &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; (usually measured in kg/s or lb/s). In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in [[solid rocket]]s it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).

Rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.

In practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty;&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.
For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability ([[BE-3]], [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]]) can be throttled to as low as 18–20 percent of rated thrust.&lt;!-- eg, Blue Orgin BE-3 --&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20150407&gt;

Solid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
{{further information|Rocket#Energy efficiency}}
[[File:Rocket propulsion efficiency.svg|thumb|Rocket vehicle mechanical efficiency as a function of vehicle instantaneous speed divided by effective exhaust speed. These percentages need to be multiplied by internal engine efficiency to get overall efficiency.]]
Rocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient [[heat engines]] for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high [[compression ratio]]. Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to [[adiabatic expansion]] which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the [[Carnot cycle]]. Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.

For a ''vehicle'' employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all [[jet propulsion]].) &lt;!--- it's very counterintuitive, a way to look at it is that energy= force x distance, but at zero speed you have no movement and you lose lots of energy in the jet ---&gt;See [[Rocket#Energy efficiency|Rocket energy efficiency]] for more details.

Rockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio. This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.

This high performance is due to the small volume of [[pressure vessel]]s that make up the engine—the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved. The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has a density about one thousand times lower.

{{Engine thrust to weight table}}

Of the liquid propellants used, density is worst for [[liquid hydrogen]]. Although this propellant is marvellous in many ways, it has a very low density, about one fourteenth that of water. This makes the turbopumps and pipework larger and heavier, and this is reflected in the thrust-to-weight ratio of engines that use it (for example the SSME) compared to those that do not (NK-33).

==Cooling==
For efficiency reasons, and because they physically can, rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200&amp;nbsp;°C or ~5,800&amp;nbsp;°F).

Most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust. Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency. In addition, [[wiktionary:duct engine|duct engines]] use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; Rockets have none of these inherent disadvantages.

Therefore, temperatures used in rockets are very often far higher than the melting point of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper). Two exceptions are [[graphite]] and [[tungsten]], although both are subject to oxidation if not protected. Indeed, many construction materials can make perfectly acceptable propellants in their own right. It is important that these materials be prevented from combusting, melting or vaporising to the point of failure. This is sometimes somewhat facetiously termed an "engine-rich exhaust". Materials technology could potentially place an upper limit on the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.

Alternatively, rockets may use more common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot. [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|Regenerative cooling]], where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal [[boundary layer]] touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.

In rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle. This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there. (See [[#Rocket nozzles|rocket nozzles]] above for temperatures in nozzle).

In rockets the coolant methods include:

#uncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)
#[[ablation|ablative]] walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).
#[[radiative cooling]] (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)
#dump cooling (a propellant, usually [[hydrogen]], is passed around the chamber and dumped)
#[[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] ([[liquid rocket]]s use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)
#curtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)
#film cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)

In all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a [[boundary layer]]) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature. Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.

Disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.

With regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber. This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant. This may be achieved by making the coolant [[velocity]] in the channels as high as possible.

In practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.

Liquid-fuelled engines are often run [[Air-fuel ratio|fuel-rich]], which lowers combustion temperatures.  This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system. This can also ''increase'' performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.

==Mechanical issues==
Rocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10–200{{nbsp}}bar (1–20{{nbsp}}MPa, 150–3,000{{nbsp}}psi). When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.

However, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large [[hoop stress]]es – rocket engines are [[pressure vessel]]s.

Worse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.

In addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create [[internal stresses]].

==Acoustic issues==
The extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of [[organ pipe]]-like resonances and gas turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/414364/whats-the-deal-with-rocket-vibrations/|title=What's the Deal with Rocket Vibrations?|last=Sauser|first=Brittany|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion instabilities===
The combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature. The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of ±200&amp;nbsp;psi at 25&amp;nbsp;kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a [[deflagration to detonation transition]]; the supersonic [[pressure wave]] formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.&lt;ref name="titan2"&gt;{{cite book|author=David K. Stumpf|title=Titian II: A History of a Cold War Missile Program|edition=|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|date=2000|ISBN=1-55728-601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combustion instability was also a problem during [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] development. The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines. In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a "dry start" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection. During the process of man-rating Atlas for [[Project Mercury]], solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.

The problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called "racetrack" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket. It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.

More significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines. Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.

In the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved. Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.

The combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g. the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors. In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods. Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.

Periodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as "[[pogo oscillation]]s" or "pogo", named after the [[pogo stick]].

Three different types of combustion instabilities occur:

====Chugging====
This is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=sutton1975/&gt;{{rp|261}} 
This can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle. Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

====Buzzing====
This can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.&lt;ref name=sutton1975/&gt;{{rp|261}} 
It generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging. However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors – this can cause explosions with monopropellants.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

====Screeching====
This is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control. It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant "screeching" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer. Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber. Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.&lt;ref name=strutt1896&gt;
{{cite book|author=John W. Strutt|title=The Theory of Sound &amp;ndash; Volume 2|edition=2nd|publisher=McMillan (reprinted by Dover Publications in 1945)|date=1896|page=226|ISBN=}} According to Lord Rayleigh’s criterion for thermoacoustic processes, "If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged. On the other hand, if heat be given at the moment of greatest rarefaction, or abstracted at the moment of greatest condensation, the vibration is discouraged."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Rayleigh (1878) "The explanation of certain acoustical phenomena" (namely, the [[Rijke tube]]) ''Nature'', vol. 18, pages 319–321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.

Such effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process, and have usually been addressed by expensive, time consuming and extensive testing, combined with trial and error remedial correction measures.

Screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors, or changes in the propellant chemistry, or vaporising the propellant before injection, or use of [[Helmholtz damper]]s within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine's [[impulse response]] and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system.

===Exhaust noise===
{{main article|acoustic signature}}
For all but the very smallest sizes, rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy. As the [[hypersonic]] exhaust mixes with the ambient air, [[shock wave]]s are formed. The [[Space Shuttle]] generates over 200 [[dB(A)]] of noise around its base. To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] was fitted with a [[Sound Suppression System]] that sprayed 1,100,000&amp;nbsp;litres of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time. Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142&amp;nbsp;dB &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Sound Suppression System
  |publisher=NASA
  |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sound intensity]] from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity. Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live. These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions. For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.&lt;ref name="CR566"&gt;R.C. Potter and M.J. Crocker (1966). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf NASA CR-566, Acoustic Prediction Methods For Rocket Engines, Including The Effects Of Clustered Engines And Deflected Flow] From website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp;ndash; Langley (NASA &amp;ndash; Langley)&lt;/ref&gt;

More worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above. This is why so much water is typically used at launches. The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.

Generally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power ''P'' transmitted to the vehicle is &lt;math&gt;P = F*V&lt;/math&gt; for thrust ''F'' and speed ''V''). Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.

==Testing==

Rocket engines are usually statically tested at a [[rocket engine test facility|test facility]] before being put into production. For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.

==Safety==
[[Rocket]] vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures. Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In military use, rockets are not unreliable. However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch. In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously. In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Essentially all launch vehicles are test vehicles by normal aerospace standards ({{As of|2016|lc=on}}).{{Original research inline|date=January 2017}}

===Saturn family (1961–1975)===
The [[Rocketdyne H-1]] engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] [[launch vehicle]]s, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights. The [[Pratt and Whitney]] [[RL10]] engine, used in a cluster of six in the Saturn I second stage, had no catastrophic failures in 36 engine-flights. The [[Rocketdyne F-1]] engine, used in a cluster of five in the first stage of the [[Saturn V]], had no failures in 65 engine-flights. The [[Rocketdyne J-2]] engine, used in a cluster of five in the Saturn V second stage, and singly in the Saturn IB second stage and Saturn V third stage, had no catastrophic failures in 86 engine-flights.&lt;ref&gt;The J-2 had three premature in-flight shutdowns, and one failure to restart in orbit.

==Chemistry==

[[Rocket propellant]]s require a high [[specific energy]] (energy per unit mass), because ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, and exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine, on which vehicle performance depends.

Aside from inevitable losses and imperfections in the engine, incomplete combustion, etc., after specific reaction energy, the main theoretical limit reducing the exhaust velocity obtained is that, according to the laws of thermodynamics, a fraction of the chemical energy may go into rotation of the exhaust molecules, where it is unavailable for producing thrust. Monatomic gases like helium have only three degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three dimensions of space, {''x,y,z''}, and only such spherically symmetric molecules escape this kind of loss. A diatomic molecule like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can rotate about either of the two axes perpendicular to the one joining the two atoms, and as the [[equipartition]] law of statistical mechanics demands that the available thermal energy be divided equally among the degrees of freedom, for such a gas in thermal equilibrium 3/5 of the energy can go into unidirectional motion, and 2/5 into rotation (actually, the vibration of the molecule should not be neglected, see [[Heat capacity#Diatomic gas|gas heat capacity]]). A triatomic molecule like water has six degrees of freedom, so the energy is divided equally among rotational and translational degrees of freedom. For most chemical reactions the latter situation is the case. This issue is traditionally described in terms of the ratio, gamma, of the specific heat of the gas at constant volume to that at constant pressure. The rotational energy loss is largely recovered in practice if the expansion nozzle is large enough to allow the gases to expand and cool sufficiently, the function of the nozzle being to convert the random thermal motions of the molecules in the combustion chamber into the unidirectional translation that produces thrust. As long as the exhaust gas remains in equilibrium as it expands, the initial rotational energy will be largely returned to translation in the nozzle.

Although the specific reaction energy per unit mass of reactants is key, low mean molecular weight in the reaction products is also important in practice in determining exhaust velocity. This is because the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors. Because temperature is proportional to the mean ''energy per molecule'', a given amount of energy distributed among more molecules of lower mass permits a higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature. This means low atomic mass elements are favoured. Liquid [[hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[oxygen]] (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yarchive.net/space/rocket/fuels/fuel_ratio.html Newsgroup correspondence], 1998-99&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note in computing the specific reaction energy, that the ''entire mass of the propellants, including both fuel and oxidiser'', must be included. The fact that air-breathing engines are typically able to obtain oxygen "for free" without having to carry it along, accounts for one factor of why air-breathing engines are very much more propellant-mass efficient, and one reason that rocket engines are far less suitable for most ordinary terrestrial applications. Fuels for car or [[turbojet engine]]s, use atmospheric oxygen and so have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.

Computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rocketworkbench.sourceforge.net/equil.phtml Complex chemical equilibrium and rocket performance calculations], Cpropep-Web&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://propulsion-analysis.com/ Tool for Rocket Propulsion Analysis], RPA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ NASA Computer program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications], CEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ignition==
{{further information|Combustion}}
With liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.

With liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.
This is sometimes called a ''[[hard start]]'' or a ''rapid unscheduled disassembly'' (RUD).&lt;ref name=aw20121126&gt;
{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Falcon 9 RUD? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&amp;plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321053215/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&amp;plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2014-03-21 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} or electric spark ignition&lt;ref name=nsf20161003&gt;
{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=ITS Propulsion – The evolution of the SpaceX Raptor engine |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-10-03 |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/10/its-propulsion-evolution-raptor-engine/ |accessdate=2016-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be employed. Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact ([[hypergolic]]), and non-hypergolic fuels can be "chemically ignited" by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).

Gaseous propellants generally will not cause [[hard start]]s, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.

Solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

Once ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.
Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds. However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

==Jet physics==
[[File:Armadillo Aerospace Pixel Hover.jpg|thumb|right|Armadillo aerospace's quad vehicle showing visible banding (shock diamonds) in the exhaust jet]]
Rocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine, design altitude, altitude, thrust and other factors.

Carbon rich exhausts from [[kerosene]] fuels are often orange in colour due to the [[black body radiation]] of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue [[Swan band]]s. [[high test peroxide|Peroxide]] oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely [[steam]] and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]]. Jets from [[solid rocket]]s can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process.

Some exhausts, notably [[alcohol]] fuelled rockets, can show visible [[shock diamond]]s. These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.

The shape of the jet varies by the design altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.

| Mach 0 to Mach 4.5+ (can also run exoatmospheric), good efficiency at Mach 2 to 4
| Similar efficiency to rockets at low speed or exoatmospheric, inlet difficulties, a relatively undeveloped and unexplored type, cooling difficulties, very noisy, thrust/weight ratio is similar to ramjets.
|-
! [[Turborocket]]
| A combined cycle turbojet/rocket where an additional oxidiser such as oxygen is added to the airstream to increase maximum altitude
| Very close to existing designs, operates in very high altitude, wide range of altitude and airspeed

| Energy is imparted to a usually inert fluid serving as reaction mass via [[Joule heating]] of a heating element. May also be used to impart extra energy to a monopropellant.
| Efficient where electrical power is at a lower premium than mass. Higher [[specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] than monopropellant alone, about 40% higher.
| Requires a lot of power, hence typically yields low thrust.

| Identical to resistojet except the heating element is replaced with an electrical arc, eliminating the physical requirements of the heating element.
| 1,600 seconds [[specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]]
| Very low thrust and high power, performance is similar to [[ion drive]].

==== Solar thermal ====

The [[Solar thermal rocket]] would make use of solar power to directly heat [[reaction mass]], and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do. A solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as [[Concentrating solar power|concentrator]]s and [[mirror]]s. The heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust. The engine thrust is directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation and inversely proportional to the ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;.

|-
! [[Laser propulsion|Light-beam-powered rocket]]
| Propellant is heated by light beam (often laser) aimed at vehicle from a distance, either directly or indirectly via heat exchanger
| Simple in principle, in principle very high exhaust speeds can be achieved
| ~1 MW of power per kg of payload is needed to achieve orbit, relatively high accelerations, lasers are blocked by clouds, fog, reflected laser light may be dangerous, pretty much needs hydrogen monopropellant for good performance which needs heavy tankage, some designs are limited to ~600 seconds due to reemission of light since propellant/heat exchanger gets white hot
|-
! [[Beam-powered propulsion|Microwave-beam-powered rocket]]
| Propellant is heated by microwave beam aimed at vehicle from a distance
| [[Specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] is comparable to Nuclear Thermal rocket combined with T/W comparable to conventional rocket.  While LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellant offers the highest I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; and rocket payload fraction, ammonia or methane are economically superior for earth-to-orbit rockets due to their particular combination of high density and I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;.  [[Single-stage-to-orbit|SSTO]] operation is possible with these propellants even for small rockets, so there are no location, trajectory and shock constraints added by the rocket staging process.  Microwaves are 10-100× cheaper in $/watt than lasers and have all-weather operation at frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;GHz.
| 0.3-3{{nbsp}}MW of power per kg of payload is needed to achieve orbit depending on the propellant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parkinresearch.com/microwave-thermal-rockets/|title=Microwave Thermal Rockets|last=Parkin|first=Kevin|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this incurs infrastructure cost for the beam director plus related R&amp;D costs.  Concepts operating in the millimeter-wave region have to contend with weather availability and high altitude beam director sites as well as effective transmitter diameters measuring 30–300 meters to propel a vehicle to LEO.  Concepts operating in X-band or below must have effective transmitter diameters measured in kilometers to achieve a fine enough beam to follow a vehicle to LEO.  The transmitters are too large to fit on mobile platforms and so microwave-powered rockets are constrained to launch near fixed beam director sites.

=== Nuclear ===

[[Nuclear propulsion]] includes a wide variety of [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] methods that use some form of [[nuclear reaction]] as their primary power source. Various types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them tested, for spacecraft applications:

==History of rocket engines==
According to the writings of the Roman [[Aulus Gellius]], in c. 400 BC, a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] named [[Archytas]], propelled a wooden bird along wires using steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leofranc Holford-Strevens|title=Aulus Gellius: An Antonine Author and his Achievement&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Revised paperback |date=2005 |isbn=0-19-928980-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Archytas |volume=2 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would not appear to have been powerful enough to take off under its own thrust.
;
The ''[[aeolipile]]'' described in the first century BC&lt;!--[[Vitruvius]] described it before Hero--&gt; (often known as ''[[Hero's engine]]'') essentially consists of a [[steam rocket]] on a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. It was created almost two millennia before the [[Industrial Revolution]] but the principles behind it were not well understood, and its full potential was not realised for a millennium.&lt;!--Not sure what this latter refers to, but it's probably not critical here--&gt;

The availability of [[black powder]] to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket. Ninth Century [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] [[Alchemy|alchemists]] discovered black powder in a search for the [[elixir of life]]; this accidental discovery led to [[fire arrow]]s which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.

It is stated that "the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century". A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled ''Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes'' (abbreviated as ''The Book of Fires''). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries—two of which are rockets.  The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in [[Lauraceae|laurel]] oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to "fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything".  The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter—all finely powdered on a marble slab.  This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case.  The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled [[Greek fire]] into self-propelled rocketry. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.  In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509-1576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket engines were also brought in use by [[Tippu Sultan]], the king of Mysore. These rockets could be of various sizes, but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1+1/2|-|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} long. The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant. A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost {{convert|1000|yd|m}}. These 'rockets', fitted with swords used to travel long distance, several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy. These rockets were used against British empire very effectively.

Slow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first wrote about [[liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engines]]. He was the first to develop the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], though it was not published widely for some years.

The modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Goddard was the first to use a [[De Laval nozzle]] on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five. This was the birth of the modern rocket engine. He calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon. He began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch, in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket. Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;{{rp|247–266}}

During the late 1930s, German scientists, such as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Hellmuth Walter]], investigated installing liquid-fueled rockets in military aircraft ([[Heinkel He 112]], [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]], [[Heinkel He 176|He 176]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lutz Warsitz|title=The First Jet Pilot - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz|edition=|publisher=Pen and Sword Ltd.|date=2009|ISBN=978-1-84415-818-8}} Includes von Braun’s and Hellmuth Walter’s experiments with rocket aircraft. [http://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/?product_id=1762 English edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbopump was first employed by German scientists in WWII. Until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic, and the [[V-2 rocket|A4]] ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel, which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently.

[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion]] (''Замкнутая схема'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|date=2005|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].

In the West, the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].

Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process (arguably not ''staged combustion'', but that's mostly a question of semantics) by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, whilst avoiding the major engineering problems.

Liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America, the [[RL-10]] engine first flew in 1962. Hydrogen engines were used as part of the [[Apollo program]]; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle.

Most engines on one rocket flight was 44 set by NASA in 2016 on a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.space.com/33810-nasa-world-record-most-rocket-engines.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Root hair curling''' is the process by which the [[root hair]]s of [[legume]] plants curl around bacteria to allow an infection into the cortical cells of the roots to form a [[nitrogen fixing]] nodule.

Legume plants, just like all plants, need nitrogen in order to grow.  Legumes include plants such as alfalfa, beans, peanuts, and lentils.  Nitrogen is available in excess in the air, but it that form is not actually usable by plants.  The gaseous form (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) must be reduced to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in a process known as [[nitrogen fixation]].&lt;ref name="Wagner_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner SC | date = 2011 | title = Biological Nitrogen Fixation | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | page = 15 | url = https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/biological-nitrogen-fixation-23570419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This nitrogen fixation can occur in many ways, including bacterial symbiosis, adding ammonia-based fertilizer to the soil and ammonia accumulation from decaying matter. The problem is that plant cannot fix nitrogen with their own processes, so they use bacterial [[Symbiosis|symbioses]].&lt;ref name="Wagner_2011" /&gt;  Different plants associate with different bacteria, but legume plants symbiose with ''[[Rhizobium]]'' bacteria.  These bacteria associate with the roots of the plant, since that is where plants take up nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber SA, Walker JM, Vasey EH | title = Mechanisms for movement of plant nutrients from soil and fertilizer to plant root. | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | date = May 1963 | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–7 | doi = 10.1021/jf60127a017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process by which legumes associate with ''Rhizobium'' includes many proteins and chemicals.  First of all, the legume root itself will release flavonoids in order to attract ''Rhizobium'' to itself. Flavonoids will also activate specific genes in the bacteria that initiate nodule formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eckardt NA | title = The Role of Flavonoids in Root Nodule Development and Auxin Transport in Medicago truncatula | journal = The Plant Cell | date = June 2006 | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1539–1540 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.106.044768 | pmc = 1488913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These genes are called ''nod'' genes, and they excrete [[Nod factor|''nod'' factors]].&lt;ref name="Esseling_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esseling JJ, Lhuissier FG, Emons AM | title = Nod factor-induced root hair curling: continuous polar growth towards the point of nod factor application | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 132 | issue = 4 | pages = 1982–8 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12913154 | pmc = 181283 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.021634 | url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/132/4/1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ''nod'' factors initiate the actual curling of the root.  The curling begins with the very tip of the root hair curling around the ''Rhizobium''.  Within the root tip, a small tube called the infection thread forms, which provides a pathway for the ''Rhizobium'' to travel into the root epidermal cells as the root hair continues to curl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Joan | last1 = Slonczewski | first2 = John Watkins | last2 = Foster | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951925510 | title = Microbiology: An Evolving Science | isbn = 0393614034 | edition = Fourth | location = New York | oclc = 951925510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial curling can even be by ''nod'' factor alone.&lt;ref name="Esseling_2003" /&gt;  An experiment by Esseling et. al. demonstrated this.  These experimenters isolated ''nod'' factor and applied the chemical at specific points on the root hair. The root hairs curled in the direction of the application, demonstrating the action of a root hair that is attempting to curl around a bacterium.  Even application on lateral roots caused curling.  This demonstrated that the ''nod'' factor, not the bacterium itself, causes the stimulation of the curling.

'''Supervisory control and data acquisition''' ('''SCADA''') is a [[control system]] architecture that uses computers, networked data communications and [[graphical user interface]]s for [[high-level]] process [[supervisory management]], but uses other peripheral devices such as [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) and discrete [[PID controller]]s to interface with the process plant or machinery. The operator interfaces that enable monitoring and the issuing of process commands, such as controller set point changes, are handled through the SCADA computer system. However, the real-time control logic or controller calculations are performed by networked modules that connect to the field sensors and [[actuators]].

The SCADA concept was developed as a universal means of remote access to a variety of local control modules, which could be from different manufacturers allowing access through standard automation [[List of automation protocols|protocols]]. In practice, large SCADA systems have grown to become very similar to [[distributed control system]]s in function, but using multiple means of interfacing with the plant. They can control large-scale processes that can include multiple sites, and work over large distances as well as small distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfxr5DikdP0 |title=Back to Basics: SCADA |author=Boys, Walt |publisher=Automation TV: Control Global - Control Design |date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commonly-used types of [[industrial control system]]s, however there are concerns about SCADA systems being vulnerable to cyberwarfare/cyberterrorism attacks.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The SCADA concept in control operations==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation]]

The key attribute of a SCADA system is its ability to perform a supervisory operation over a variety of other proprietary devices.

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.

Referring to the diagram,

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s.
* Level 1 contains the industrialised input/output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and targets.
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

Level 1 contains the [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) or [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTUs).

Level 2 contains the SCADA software and computing platform. The SCADA software exists only at this supervisory level as control actions are performed automatically by RTUs or PLCs. SCADA control functions are usually restricted to basic overriding or supervisory level intervention. For example, a PLC may control the flow of cooling water through part of an industrial process to a set point level, but the SCADA system software will allow operators to change the set points for the flow. The SCADA also enables alarm conditions, such as loss of flow or high temperature, to be displayed and recorded. A [[feedback control]] loop is directly controlled by the RTU or PLC, but the SCADA software monitors the overall performance of the loop.

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly process control in the traditional sense, but are where production control and scheduling takes place.

[[Data acquisition]] begins at the RTU or PLC level and includes [[instrumentation]] readings and equipment status reports that are communicated to level 2 SCADA as required. Data is then compiled and formatted in such a way that a control room operator using the HMI ([[Human Machine Interface]]) can make supervisory decisions to adjust or override normal RTU (PLC) controls. Data may also be fed to a [[Operational historian|historian]], often built on a commodity [[database management system]], to allow trending and other analytical auditing.

SCADA systems typically use  a ''tag database'', which contains data elements called ''tags'' or ''points'', which relate to specific instrumentation or actuators within the process system according to such as the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]]. Data is accumulated against these unique process control equipment tag references.

==Examples of use==
[[File:Freer Water Control and Improvement District - Diana Adame.jpg|thumb|Example of SCADA used in office environment to remotely monitor a process]]

Both large and small systems can be built using the SCADA concept. These systems can range from just tens to thousands of [[control loop]]s, depending on the application. Example processes include industrial, infrastructure, and facility-based processes, as described below:

* [[Industrial process]]es include  [[manufacturing]], [[Process control]],  [[power generation]], [[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]], and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Infrastructure]] processes may be public or private, and include [[water treatment]] and distribution, wastewater collection and [[waste water treatment|treatment]], [[Fossil gas pipeline|oil and gas pipeline]]s, [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], and [[wind farm]]s.
* Facility processes, including buildings, airports, [[Ship#Today|ship]]s, and [[space station]]s. They monitor and control [[heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] systems (HVAC), [[Access control|access]], and [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption]].

However, SCADA systems may have security vulnerabilities, so the systems should be evaluated to identify risks and solutions implemented to mitigate those risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyer|first= Stuart A.|title= SCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition|year=2010 |publisher= ISA - International Society of Automation |location= USA |isbn=978-1-936007-09-7 |page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCADA system components==
[[Image:Scada std anim no lang.gif|thumb|Typical SCADA mimic shown as an animation. For process plant, these are based upon the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]].]]

A SCADA system usually consists of the following main elements:

===Supervisory computers===
This is the core of the SCADA system, gathering data on the process and sending control commands to the field connected devices. It refers to the computer and software responsible for communicating with the field connection controllers, which are RTUs and PLCs, and includes the HMI software running on operator workstations.  In smaller SCADA systems, the supervisory computer may be composed of a single PC, in which case the HMI is a part of this computer. In larger SCADA systems, the master station may include several HMIs hosted on client computers, multiple servers for data acquisition, distributed software applications, and disaster recovery sites. To increase the integrity of the system the multiple servers will often be configured in a [[Dual modular redundancy|dual-redundant]] or [[Hot spare|hot-standby]] formation providing continuous control and monitoring in the event of a server malfunction or breakdown.

===Remote terminal units===
{{Further information|Remote terminal unit}}
[[Remote terminal unit]]s, also known as (RTUs),  connect to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory computer system.  RTUs are "intelligent I/O" and often have embedded control capabilities such as [[ladder logic]] in order to accomplish [[Boolean expression|boolean]] logic operations.&lt;ref name="Hieb2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Hieb|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA  Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-_PPgAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=University of Louisville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmable logic controllers===
{{Further information|Programmable logic controller}}
Also known as PLCs, these are connected to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory system in the same way as RTUs. PLCs have more sophisticated embedded control capabilities than RTUs, and are programmed in one or more [[IEC 61131-3]] programming languages. PLCs are often used in place of RTUs as field devices because they are more economical, versatile, flexible and configurable.

===Communication infrastructure===
This connects the supervisory computer system to the RTUs and PLCs, and may use industry standard or manufacturer proprietary protocols.
Both RTU's and PLC's operate autonomously on the near-real time control of the process, using the last command given from the supervisory system. Failure of the communications network does not necessarily stop the plant process controls, and on resumption of communications, the operator can continue with monitoring and control. Some critical systems will have dual redundant data highways, often cabled via diverse routes.

===Human-machine interface===
{{Further information|Graphical user interface}}
[[File:Scada_Animation.ogv|thumb|right|More complex SCADA animation showing control of four batch cookers]]
The human-machine interface (HMI) is the operator window of the supervisory system. It presents plant information to the operating personnel graphically in the form of mimic diagrams, which are a schematic representation of the plant being controlled, and alarm and event logging pages. The HMI is linked to the SCADA supervisory computer to provide live data to drive the mimic diagrams, alarm displays and trending graphs. In many installations the HMI is the graphical user interface for the operator, collects all data from external devices, creates reports, performs alarming, sends notifications, etc.

Mimic diagrams consist of line graphics and schematic symbols to represent process elements, or may consist of digital photographs of the process equipment overlain with animated symbols.

Supervisory operation of the plant is by means of the HMI, with operators issuing commands using mouse pointers, keyboards and touch screens. For example, a symbol of a pump can show the operator that the pump is running, and a flow meter symbol can show how much fluid it is pumping through the pipe. The operator can switch the pump off from the mimic by a mouse click or screen touch. The HMI will show the flow rate of the fluid in the pipe decrease in real time.

The HMI package for a SCADA system typically includes a drawing program that the operators or system maintenance personnel use to change the way these points are represented in the interface. These representations can be as simple as an on-screen traffic light, which represents the state of an actual traffic light in the field, or as complex as a multi-projector display representing the position of all of the elevators in a skyscraper or all of the trains on a railway.

A '''"historian",''' is a software service within the HMI which accumulates time-stamped data, events, and alarms in a database which can be queried or used to populate graphic trends in the HMI.  The historian is a client that requests data from a data acquisition server.&lt;ref name="Raul2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aquino-Santos, Raul|title=Emerging Technologies in Wireless Ad-hoc Networks: Applications and Future Development: Applications and Future Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UN2eBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=30 November 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60960-029-7|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alarm handling==
{{Further information|Alarm management}}
An important part of most SCADA implementations is [[alarm management|alarm handling]]. The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation of one or more alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.

Alarm conditions can be explicit—for example, an alarm point is a digital status point that has either the value NORMAL or ALARM that is calculated by a formula based on the values in other analogue and digital points—or implicit: the SCADA system might automatically monitor whether the value in an analogue point lies outside high and low- limit values associated with that point.

Examples of alarm indicators include a siren, a pop-up box on a screen, or a coloured or flashing area on a screen (that might act in a similar way to the "fuel tank empty" light in a car); in each case, the role of the alarm indicator is to draw the operator's attention to the part of the system 'in alarm' so that appropriate action can be taken.

==PLC/RTU programming==
"Smart" RTUs, or standard PLCs, are capable of autonomously executing simple logic processes without involving the supervisory computer. They employ standardized control programming languages  such as under, [[IEC 61131-3]] (a suite of 5 programming languages including function block, ladder, structured text, sequence function charts and instruction list), is frequently used to create programs which run on these RTUs and PLCs.  Unlike a procedural language such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[FORTRAN]], IEC 61131-3 has minimal training requirements by virtue of resembling historic physical control arrays. This allows SCADA system engineers to perform both the design and implementation of a program to be executed on an RTU or PLC.

A [[programmable automation controller]] (PAC) is a compact controller that combines the features and capabilities of a PC-based control system with that of a typical PLC. PACs are deployed in SCADA systems to provide RTU and PLC functions. In many electrical substation SCADA applications, "distributed RTUs" use information processors or station computers to communicate with [[digital protective relay]]s, PACs, and other devices for I/O, and communicate with the SCADA master in lieu of a traditional RTU.

==PLC commercial integration==
Since about 1998, virtually all major PLC manufacturers have offered integrated HMI/SCADA systems, many of them using open and non-proprietary communications protocols.  Numerous specialized third-party HMI/SCADA packages, offering built-in compatibility with most major PLCs, have also entered the market, allowing mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and technicians to configure HMIs themselves, without the need for a custom-made program written by a software programmer.
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) connects to physical equipment. Typically, an RTU converts the electrical signals from the equipment to digital values such as the open/closed status from a switch or a valve, or measurements such as pressure, flow, voltage or current. By converting and sending these electrical signals out to equipment the RTU can control equipment, such as opening or closing a switch or a valve, or setting the speed of a pump.

==Communication infrastructure and methods==
SCADA systems have traditionally used combinations of radio and direct wired connections, although  [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET/SDH]] is also frequently used for large systems such as railways and power stations. The remote management or monitoring function of a SCADA system is often referred to as [[telemetry]]. Some users want SCADA data to travel over their pre-established corporate networks or to share the network with other applications. The legacy of the early low-bandwidth protocols remains, though.

SCADA protocols are designed to be very compact. Many are designed to send information only when the master station polls the RTU. Typical legacy SCADA protocols include [[Modbus]] RTU, [[RP-570]], [[Profibus]] and Conitel. These communication protocols, with the exception of Modbus (Modbus has been made open by Schneider Electric), are all SCADA-vendor specific but are widely adopted and used. Standard protocols are [[IEC 60870-5|IEC 60870-5-101 or 104]], [[IEC 61850]] and [[DNP3]]. These communication protocols are standardized and recognized by all major SCADA vendors. Many of these protocols now contain extensions to operate over [[TCP/IP]]. Although the use of conventional networking specifications, such as [[TCP/IP]], blurs the line between traditional and industrial networking, they each fulfill fundamentally differing requirements.&lt;ref name=GallowayIntro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Industrial Control Networks|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials|year=2012|url=http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/Preprint-GallowayHancke-IndustrialControlSurvey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Network simulation]] can be used in conjunction with SCADA simulators to perform various 'what-if' analyses.

With increasing security demands (such as [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[critical infrastructure protection]] (CIP) in the US), there is increasing use of satellite-based communication. This has the key advantages that the infrastructure can be self-contained (not using circuits from the public telephone system), can have built-in encryption, and can be engineered to the availability and reliability required by the SCADA system operator.  Earlier experiences using consumer-grade [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] were poor. Modern carrier-class systems provide the quality of service required for SCADA.&lt;ref name=berganELP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergan|first=Christian|title=Demystifying Satellite for the Smart Grid: Four Common Misconceptions|journal=Electric Light &amp; Powers|date=August 2011|volume=16|series=Utility Automation &amp; Engineering T&amp;D|issue=8|url=http://www.elp.com/index/display/article-display/5666163079/articles/utility-automation-engineering-td/volume-16/issue-8/features/demystifying-satellite-for-the-smart-grid-four-common-misconceptions.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|at=Four|publisher=PennWell|location=Tulsa, OK|quote=satellite is a cost-effective and secure solution that can provide backup communications and easily support core smart grid applications like SCADA, telemetry, AMI backhaul and distribution automation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTUs and other automatic controller devices were developed before the advent of industry wide standards for interoperability. The result is that developers and their management created a multitude of control protocols. Among the larger vendors, there was also the incentive to create their own protocol to "lock in" their customer base. A [[list of automation protocols]] is compiled here.

[[OLE for process control]] (OPC) can connect different hardware and software, allowing communication even between devices originally not intended to be part of an industrial network.

Standardisation in the field of mySCADA protocols resulted into the vendor independent protocol called OPC UA (Unified Architecture). OPC UA is starting to be widely adopted among multiple SCADA vendors. 

==SCADA architecture development==
[[File:SCADA C4ISR Facilities.pdf|thumb|The [[United States Army]]'s Training Manual 5-601 covers "SCADA Systems for [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]] Facilities"]]
SCADA systems have evolved through four generations as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/ICS_Basics/SCADA%20Basics%20-%20NCS%20TIB%2004-1.pdf |title=Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems |publisher=NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM |author=OFFICE OF THE MANAGER NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMctober 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/scada-systems |title=SCADA Systems april 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scadahistory.com/ |title=A Brief History of SCADA/EMS (2015) |author=J. Russel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811051350/http://scadahistory.com/ |archivedate=11 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First generation: "monolithic"===
Early SCADA system computing was done by large [[minicomputers]]. Common network services did not exist at the time SCADA was developed. Thus SCADA systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. The first-generation SCADA system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all the [[Remote Terminal Unit]] sites and was used in the event of failure of the primary mainframe system.&lt;ref name="Proquest-text"&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5O5N1vjbQgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-54831-7|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some first generation SCADA systems were developed as "turn key" operations that ran on minicomputers such as the [[PDP-11]] series made by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

===Second generation: "distributed"===
SCADA information and command processing was distributed across multiple stations which were connected through a LAN. Information was shared in near real time. Each station was responsible for a particular task, which reduced the cost as compared to First Generation SCADA. The network protocols used were still not standardized. Since these protocols were proprietary, very few people beyond the developers knew enough to determine how secure a SCADA installation was. Security of the SCADA installation was usually overlooked.
===Third generation: "networked"===

Similar to a distributed architecture, any complex SCADA can be reduced to the simplest components and connected through communication protocols. In the case of a networked design, the system may be spread across more than one LAN network called a [[Process control network|process control network (PCN)]] and separated geographically. Several distributed architecture SCADAs running in parallel, with a single supervisor and historian, could be considered a network architecture. This allows for a more cost-effective solution in very large scale systems.

===Fourth generation: "Internet of things"===
With the commercial availability of [[cloud computing]], SCADA systems have increasingly adopted [[Internet of things]] technology to significantly improve interoperability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduce infrastructure costs and increase ease of maintenance and integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scada.com/verticals/internetofthings/ SCADA and the Internet of Things] Retrieved May 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, SCADA systems can now report state in near real-time and use the horizontal scale available in cloud environments to implement more complex control algorithms &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; than are practically feasible to implement on traditional [[programmable logic controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms/ How The "Internet Of Things" Is Turning Cities Into Living Organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181958/http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms |date=21 October 2013 }} Retrieved September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the use of open network protocols such as [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] inherent in the Internet of things technology, provides a more readily comprehensible and manageable security boundary than the heterogeneous mix of proprietary network protocols typical of many decentralized SCADA implementations.

This decentralization of data also requires a different approach to SCADA than traditional PLC based programs. When a SCADA system is used locally, the preferred methodology involves binding the graphics on the user interface to the data stored in specific PLC memory addresses. However, when the data comes from a disparate mix of sensors, controllers and databases (which may be local or at varied connected locations), the typical 1 to 1 mapping becomes problematic. A solution to this is [[data modeling]], a concept derived from object oriented programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The History of Data Modeling | url=http://www.exforsys.com/tutorials/data-modeling/the-history-of-data-modeling.html | newspaper=Exforsys Inc. | date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a data model, a virtual representation of each device is constructed in the SCADA software. These virtual representations (“models”) can contain not just the address mapping of the device represented, but also any other pertinent information (web based info, database entries, media files, etc.) that may be used by other facets of the SCADA/IoT implementation. As the increased complexity of the Internet of things renders traditional SCADA increasingly “house-bound,” and as communication protocols evolve to favor platform-independent, service-oriented architecture (such as [[OPC UA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CIM and OPC UA for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01368458/ | newspaper=Proceedings of the IEEE ISGT 2016 Conference. | date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is likely that more SCADA software developers will implement some form of data modeling.

==Security issues==
SCADA systems that tie together decentralized facilities such as power, oil, gas pipelines, water distribution and wastewater collection systems were designed to be open, robust, and easily operated and repaired, but not necessarily secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyes|first= Walt|title=Instrumentation Reference Book, 4th Edition|year=2011 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location= USA|isbn=0-7506-8308-2|page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move from proprietary technologies to more standardized and open solutions together with the increased number of connections between SCADA systems, office networks and the [[Internet]] has made them more vulnerable to types of [[Attack (computing)#Types of attacks|network attacks]] that are relatively common in [[computer security]]. For example, [[ICS-CERT|United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)]] released a vulnerability advisory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-11-231-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-231-01—INDUCTIVE AUTOMATION IGNITION INFORMATION DISCLOSURE VULNERABILITY |accessdate=21 Jan 2013|date=19 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning that unauthenticated users could download sensitive configuration information including [[Cryptographic hash function#File or data identifier|password hashes]] from an [[Inductive Automation]] [[Ignition SCADA|Ignition]] system utilizing a standard [[Semantic URL attack|attack type]] leveraging access to the [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] [[Embedded Web server]]. Security researcher Jerry Brown submitted a similar advisory regarding a [[buffer overflow]] vulnerability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/pdf/ICSA-11-094-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-094-01—WONDERWARE INBATCH CLIENT ACTIVEX BUFFER OVERFLOW|accessdate=26 Mar 2013|date=13 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Wonderware]] InBatchClient [[ActiveX control]]. Both vendors made updates available prior to public vulnerability release. Mitigation recommendations were standard [[Software patching|patching]] practices and requiring [[VPN]] access for secure connectivity. Consequently, the security of some SCADA-based systems has come into question as they are seen as potentially vulnerable to [[cyber attack]]s.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-federal-06/BH-Fed-06-Maynor-Graham-up.pdf |title=SCADA Security and Terrorism: We're Not Crying Wolf |author=D.

In particular, security researchers are concerned about
* the lack of concern about security and authentication in the design, deployment and operation of some existing SCADA networks
* the belief that SCADA systems have the benefit of [[security through obscurity]] through the use of specialized protocols and proprietary interfaces
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are physically secured
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are disconnected from the Internet

SCADA systems are used to control and monitor physical processes, examples of which are transmission of electricity, transportation of gas and oil in pipelines, water distribution, traffic lights, and other systems used as the basis of modern society.  The security of these SCADA systems is important because compromise or destruction of these systems would impact multiple areas of society far removed from the original compromise.  For example, a blackout caused by a compromised electrical SCADA system would cause financial losses to all the customers that received electricity from that source.  &lt;!-- Removed FUD --&gt;How security will affect legacy SCADA and new deployments remains to be seen.

There are many threat vectors to a modern SCADA system. One is the threat of unauthorized access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting SCADA devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of [[Cryptography|cryptographic security]], allowing an attacker to control a SCADA device by sending commands over a network. In many cases SCADA users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network jacks and switches. Industrial control vendors suggest approaching SCADA security like [[Information security|Information Security]] with a [[Defense in depth#Information security|defense in depth]] strategy that leverages common IT practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockwellautomation.com/resources/downloads/rockwellautomation/pdf/products-technologies/security-technology/securat001aene.pdf|title=Industrial Security Best Practices|publisher=Rockwell Automation |accessdate=26 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliable function of SCADA systems in our modern infrastructure may be crucial to public health and safety. As such, attacks on these systems may directly or indirectly threaten public health and safety. Such an attack has already occurred, carried out on Maroochy Shire Council's sewage control system in Queensland, Australia.&lt;ref name=SlayMiller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slay|first1=J.|last2=Miller|first2=M.|title=Critical infrastructure protection|date=November 2007|publisher=Springer Boston|isbn=978-0-387-75461-1|pages=73–82|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m1100j53q348x053/|edition=Online-Ausg.|accessdate=2 May 2012|chapter=Chpt 6: Lessons Learned from the Maroochy Water Breach}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after a contractor installed a SCADA system in January 2000, system components began to function erratically. Pumps did not run when needed and alarms were not reported.  More critically, sewage flooded a nearby park and contaminated an open surface-water drainage ditch and flowed 500 meters to a tidal canal. The SCADA system was directing sewage valves to open when the design protocol should have kept them closed. Initially this was believed to be a system bug.  Monitoring of the system logs revealed the malfunctions were the result of cyber attacks. Investigators reported 46 separate instances of malicious outside interference before the culprit was identified.  The attacks were made by a disgruntled ex-employee of the company that had installed the SCADA system.  The ex-employee was hoping to be hired by the utility full-time to maintain the system.

In April 2008, the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack issued a Critical Infrastructures Report  which discussed the extreme vulnerability of SCADA systems to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event. After testing and analysis, the Commission concluded: "SCADA systems are vulnerable to an EMP event. The large numbers and widespread reliance on such systems by all of the Nation’s critical infrastructures represent a systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event. Additionally, the necessity to reboot, repair, or replace large numbers of geographically widely dispersed systems will considerably impede the Nation’s recovery from such an assault."&lt;ref name="Critical Infrastructures Report, Congressional EMP Commission, 2008"&gt;http://www.empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vendors of SCADA and control products have begun to address the risks posed by unauthorized access by developing lines of specialized industrial [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[VPN]] solutions for TCP/IP-based SCADA networks as well as external SCADA monitoring and recording equipment.&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!--Removed Marketing Magazine article, you can add it as a reference at the bottom to support a set of statements--&gt;
The [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) started formalizing SCADA security requirements in 2007 with a working group, WG4. WG4 "deals specifically with unique technical requirements, measurements, and other features required to evaluate and assure security resilience and performance of industrial automation and control systems devices".&lt;ref name=InTechViaISA&gt;{{cite news|title=Security for all|url=http://www.isa.org|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=InTech|authorlink=Security for all|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased interest in SCADA vulnerabilities has resulted in vulnerability researchers discovering vulnerabilities in commercial SCADA software &lt;!-- removed vendor names --&gt; and more general offensive SCADA techniques presented to the general security community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |title=SCADA Security – Generic Electric Grid Malware Design |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085040/http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- citations as support of the statements are fine --&gt; In electric and gas utility SCADA systems, the vulnerability of the large installed base of wired and wireless serial communications links is addressed in some cases by applying [[bump-in-the-wire]] devices that employ authentication and [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] encryption rather than replacing all existing nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | author = KEMA, Inc.

In June 2010, anti-virus security company [[VirusBlokAda]] reported the first detection of malware that attacks SCADA systems (Siemens' [[WinCC]]/PCS 7 systems) running on Windows operating systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">{{Tort law}}
The '''tort of seduction''' was a civil wrong or [[tort]] in [[common law]] legal systems, and still exists in some jurisdictions. 

An unmarried woman could sue on the grounds of [[seduction]] to obtain damages from her seducer, if her [[Sexual consent|consent to sex]] was based upon his misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="pos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Posner|year=1994|title=Sex and Reason|page=81|isbn=0-674-80279-9|quote=The tort of seduction allows an unmarried woman (formerly her father or other guardian), usually but not always a virgin, to obtain damages from her seducer, provided that he made misrepresentations to obtain her consent to sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Initially, the tort of seduction was a remedy for a father's property interest in his daughter's chastity.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; However, the damages to which the father would be entitled were based on the father's loss of the working services of a daughter, much as a master could sue if a third-party caused injury to his servant that rendered the servant unable to work, because she was "seduced and debauched" and became pregnant as a result of nonmarital sexual activity. The tort of seduction was one of the most common civil actions toward the end of the 19th century, and fathers were often successful before juries.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20030211.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 20th century, the action was criticised as maintaining "property interests in humans", and the tort was recast to recognize personal injury to the woman, rather than solely deprivation of a father's property right. Most jurisdictions granted the victim (the wronged woman) the right to sue in her own name. (Fathers could still sue as well, on the ground that they had a moral interest in their daughters' chastity).&lt;ref name=findlaw /&gt; The suing woman was "usually but not always a virgin".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt;

==England==
Historically, the seduced female could not bring a suit herself. Rather, it would be brought by her father, acting under the [[legal fiction]] that the parent-child relationship falls under the master-servant relationship. However, if the daughter was a contracted servant, a suit could not be brought by her father against her master.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==Canada==
[[Property and civil rights]] is a [[federalism|provincial power]] in [[Canada]], so all torts can vary by province.

===Ontario===
An Act to make the remedy for cases of seduction more effectual, and to tender the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support, was passed in [[Upper Canada]] on March 4, 1837. Amending traditional [[common law]], it allowed fathers to sue their daughters' masters for the tort of seduction. It also held [[biological father]]s liable for children conceived out of wedlock.

The Seduction Act was repealed in 1978.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey|first=Martha|year=1991|title=Girls and Masters: The Tort of Seduction and the Support of Bastards|journal=Canadian Journal of Family Law|volume=10|pages=137–162|url=http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/cdnjfl/art/1011991.html#bailey|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
The 1934 [[John Brownlee sex scandal]] revolved around a seduction suit.

===Other provinces===
An 1852 statute in [[Prince Edward Island]] allowed for a seduced woman to sue for herself with this tort.,&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; although damages were capped at 100 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. [[Manitoba]] and the [[North West Territories]] enacted similar legislation around the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the tort of seduction has been abolished in "most states".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt; Fears of fraudulent suits, combined with a turn away from the view of property interests in persons, led to the enactment of "[[heart balm]]" statutes, abolishing causes of action for seduction, [[breach of promise]], [[alienation of affection]], [[criminal conversation]], etc. in most states in the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7758">'''Superiorization''' is an [[iterative method]] for [[constrained optimization]]. It is used for improving the efficacy of an iterative method whose convergence is resilient to certain kinds of perturbations. Such perturbations are designed to "force" the perturbed [[algorithm]] to produce more useful results for the intended application than the ones that are produced by the original iterative algorithm. The perturbed algorithm is called the '''superiorized version''' of the original unperturbed algorithm. If the original algorithm is computationally efficient and useful in terms of the target application and if the perturbations are inexpensive to calculate, the method may be used to steer iterates without additional computation cost.

== Areas of application ==
The superiorization methodology is very general and has been used successfully in many important practical applications, such as [[iterative reconstruction]] of images from their projections,&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;G.T.

== Objective function reduction and relation with constrained optimization ==
An important case of superiorization is when the original algorithm is "feasibility-seeking" (in the sense that it strives to find some point in  a [[feasible region]] that is compatible with a family of constraints) and the perturbations that are introduced into the original iterative algorithm aim at reducing (not necessarily minimizing) a given merit function. In this case, superiorization has a unique place in [[optimization]] theory and practice. 

Many [[constrained optimization]] methods are based on methods for unconstrained optimization that are adapted to deal with constraints. Such is, for example, the class of projected gradient methods wherein the unconstrained minimization inner step "leads" the process and a projection onto the whole constraints set (the feasible region) is performed after each minimization step in order to regain feasibility. This projection onto the constraints set is in itself a non-trivial optimization problem and the need to solve it in every iteration hinders projected gradient methods and limits their efficacy to only feasible sets that are "simple to project onto". Barrier methods or [[penalty methods]] likewise are based on unconstrained optimization combined with various "add-on"s that guarantee that the constraints are preserved. Regularization methods embed the constraints into a "regularized" [[objective function]] and proceed with unconstrained solution methods for the new regularized objective function.

In contrast to these approaches, the superiorization methodology can be viewed as an antipodal way of thinking. Instead of adapting unconstrained minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking algorithms to reduce merit function values. This is done while retaining the feasibility-seeking nature of the algorithm and without paying a high computational price. Furthermore, general-purpose approaches have been developed for automatically superiorizing iterative algorithms for large classes of constraints sets and merit functions; these provide algorithms for many application tasks.

The '''Topkapı Scroll''' ({{lang-tr|Topkapı Parşömeni}}) is a [[Timurid dynasty]] pattern [[scroll]] in the collection of the [[Topkapı Palace]] museum.

The scroll is a valuable source of information, consisting of 114 patterns that may have been used both indirectly and directly by architects to create the tiling patterns in many mosques around the world, including the [[quasicrystal]] [[Girih tilings]] from [[Darb-e Imam]].

==Physical properties==
The Topkapı scroll is a {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide scroll of {{convert|29.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, which is unrolled side to side.&lt;ref name="cromwell"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cromwell, P.R. |journal=Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=36–56 |year=2009 |title=The Search for Quasi-Periodicity in Islamic 5-fold Ornament |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/760261153n347478/?p=405b9dbf45ea4f4793a097b6e12dcb08pi=7 |doi=10.1007/s00283-008-9018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the scroll is fixed to a wooden roller, and the other end is glued to a protective leather piece.&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"&gt;{{cite book | title= Geometric Design in timurid/Turkmen Architectural Practice: Thoughts on a Recently Discovered Scroll and Its Late Gothic Parallels |author=Gülru Necipoğlu |work=Timurid Art and Culture - Iran and Central Asia in the Fifteenth Century (eds (Golombek, L. and Subtelny, M.) |publisher=E.J. Brill |year=1992 |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic570061.files/articles/Geometric_Design.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[parchment]] pieces featuring various patterns are applied on the scroll. The differences in the border of some drawings indicate that the Topkapı Scroll consists of two different scrolls fixed together. The fact that it is not worn out suggests that it was not made to be used as a reference document in a craftman's workshop, but rather than as an exhibition work in the palace. It was probably a record of tiling works carried out in the palace.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Notes on a recent study of the Topkapı scroll: a review article |author=Rogers, J.M. |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=433–439 |year=1997 |jstor=619536 |doi=10.1017/s0041977x0003247x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scroll was made by one person only. Most of the patterns were drawn on two pieces of parchment that were put together, and then pasted on the scroll. The placement of the patterns on the scroll is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar [[theme (arts)|theme]]s are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

The stamp on the scroll "H1956" indicates that it is registered in the inventory of the Topkapı Palace's Treasury department.

An edition of the scroll was published with an extensive commentary, but it is now out of print.

==History==
The Topkapı Scroll was presumably prepared in Iran during the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the end of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th century. A similarity between some of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll and a tile panel in the [[Jame-e Kabir Mosque]] (grand mosque) in [[Yazd]] indicates that this scroll was created in [[Tabriz]]. On the other hand, it is possible that the scroll was made in [[Shiraz]] because it consists of mainly [[muqarnas]] in the form of a hand-held fan referred by [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] as Shirazi. It may have been looted 
by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s after the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)]].

The muqarnas on the scroll, which are mostly in the form of a hand-held fan, reflect the architectural style of the Timurid dynasty, [[Turkmen people#Turkmen in Iran and Afghanistan|Turkmen people in Iran and Central Asia]]. In contrast, the muqarnas in [[Cairo]] are in the form of [[seashell]].

The Topkapı Scroll was discovered in 1986. [[Gülru Necipoğlu]] of [[Harvard University]] published a book, which describes the scroll with copies of its patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Gülru Necipoglu: The Topkapı Scroll: geometry and ornament in Islamic architecture. Palace Museum Topkapı Library MS H. 1956. xiii, 395 pp. Santa Monica, CA: Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The book was translated into [[Persian language]] by Mihrdad Kayyumi Bidhind under the title ''Handasa va Tazyin dar Mi‘mari-yi Islami: Tomar-i Topkapı'' (Tahran, Kitabkhana-yi Milli-yi Iran, 1379).

[[File:Topkapi Scroll P290.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Quarter dome muqarnas - in the form of a seashell (top), in the form of a radial, hand-held fan (bottom)]]

The scroll consists of 114 geometric patterns drawn in ink and dye. It displays decorative ornaments found on the walls and domes of structures built between the  10th and 16th century in the Timurid dynasty. It was a guidebook for architectural designs seen in complex [[muqarnas]], [[girih]], mosaic panels and colorful tiles. The scroll does not mention how those patterns are constructed, and has no date or signature.&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

The two-dimensional figures make it unclear how they can be employed to three-dimensional ornamental objects.&lt;ref&gt;Artisans and Mathematicians in Medieval Islam. The Topkapi Scroll: Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture by Gülru Necipoğlu Review by: George Saliba (1999). Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 119, No. 4, pp. 637-645 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/604839]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=van den Hoeven, Saskia, van der Veen, Maartje |title=Muqarnas-Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.wiskuu.nl/muqarnas/Muqarnas_english8.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927070005/http://www.wiskuu.nl/muqarnas/Muqarnas_english8.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the characteristics of the Topkapı Scroll is that it includes [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] called [[Kufic#Square or geometric Kufic|square or geometric Kufic]]. This script type was seen for the first time in the state of [[Ilkhanate]], and it was presumably created in inspiration from [[Chinese character]]s in rectangular form.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt; One of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll, which matches an existing architectural structure, is the Kufic script drawn for [[banna'i]], in which tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall.  Almost exactly the same of this pattern is found on the gate of a mosque in [[Varzaneh]].&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

[[File:Topkapi Scroll P325.JPG|thumb|250px|Hexagon with Kufic scripts of six time [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) and three time [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) in rotational symmetry]]
Some of the patterns show the application of geometric principles to Islamic traditions. For example, the word [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) is repeated six times along the sides of the [[hexagon]], and the word [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) three times in a rotating wise in the inner hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hacali Necefoğlu |title=Turkish Crystallografic Patterns: From Ancient to Present |url=http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/istanbul/Necefoglu_text.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One pattern on the scroll consists of nine-pointed and eleven-pointed geometric [[star polygon#Star figures|star figures]], and other one thirteen-pointed and sixteen-pointed geometric star figures. In the [[Islamic art]], this sort of stars were developed by folding certain patterns along the sides of a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cromwell, P. R.  |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=73–85 |year=2010 |title=Islamic geometric designs from the Topkapı Scroll I: unusual arrangements of stars |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17513470903311669 |doi=10.1080/17513470903311669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the drawings on the scroll are formed by overlapped patterns of different scales. This feature is seen frequently in [[Islamic architecture]]. Detailed patterns within an ornament appear when one gets closer to a building with figures, which are difficult to perceive from the distance.&lt;ref name="cromwell"/&gt;

In business, '''training simulation''' is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, C. and Sawyer, J. (1999). ''Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development''&lt;/ref&gt; Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly&lt;ref&gt;Henfrey, Richard (1989). ''"Executive" simulation'', Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2&lt;/ref&gt; used in corporate situations to improve [[business]] awareness and [[management]] skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.

The word [[simulation]] implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a [[lifelike experience]]. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellet, Bill (1997). ''TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations'', Training Media Review Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). ''Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming''. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) ''The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning''&lt;/ref&gt; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.

__TOC__

==Purpose==

Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Elizabeth, O’Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). ''[http://www.pogc.ir/portals/0/maghalat/890706-2.pdf Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach]'', European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on [[decision making|making decisions]] in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or [[product design]], and these are called ''Functional Simulations''. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called ''Total Enterprise Simulations''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990).'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.1754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations].'' In Gentry (ed.) ''Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.

Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to "[[think outside the box]]" and see the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Graham A. ''Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.


 
Although the most common use for training simulations is in a [[corporate]] setting,&lt;ref&gt;Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Brown/publication/235314940_Using_a_business_simulation_to_teach_applied_skills_-_The_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_using_student_teams_from_multiple_countries/links/0deec52a5e16008bae000000/Using-a-business-simulation-to-teach-applied-skills-The-benefits-and-the-challenges-of-using-student-teams-from-multiple-countries.pdf Using a business simulation to teach applied skills – the benefits and the challenges of using student teams from multiple countries]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 24 Iss: 6&lt;/ref&gt; simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to [[MBA]] students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Prohaska, Charles R. and Frank, Ellen J. (1990). ''[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046878190211004 Using Simulations to Investigate Management Decision Making]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 21 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). ''Using Management Games''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). ''[http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/20147/1/Butler__Reddy_JEIT_-_Developing_Critical_Understanding_through_EBL_and_Storytelling.pdf Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9&lt;/ref&gt; If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). ''Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users''. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D. J. (1997). ''Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.

==Development==

The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). ''The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research''. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called ''The Top Management Decision Game'', and was created by the [[American Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). ''Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are [[computer]] based,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, John M. (2007). ''Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training?''&lt;/ref&gt; and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, John (1997). ''A Future for Business Simulations?'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Most simulations are based around a real [[industry]], and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.

==Integrated==

Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (1987). ''A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:

* '''Introduction:''' the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve.
* '''Lectures:''' sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event.
* '''The simulation:''' the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm.
* '''Evaluation:''' once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players’ achievements.

This integrated [[training]] will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler, I (2005). ''[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8bc/e727abf8da27f3dc4497b00499129fd31d78.pdf Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.

==Benefits==

Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:

* '''Business awareness''' – before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090590910950578 The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Time management and organization''' – most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates’ skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). ''Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate.
* '''Team coordination''' – the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). ''An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results''&lt;/ref&gt; improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations.
* '''Problem solving''' – simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (2001). ''[http://www.coulthard.com/library/Files/faria_2001_thechangingnatureofbusinesssimulationgamingresearch.pdf The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Successful resolution of these shows good management skills.
 
If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Crossdressing}}

'''Transvestic fetishism''' is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to those who are thought to have an excessive sexual or erotic interest in [[cross-dressing]]; this interest is often expressed in [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] behavior.  It differs from cross-dressing for entertainment or other purposes that do not involve [[sexual arousal]], and is categorized as a [[paraphilia]] in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book
| first=
| last= American Psychiatric Association
| year= 2013
| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

| pages=685–705
| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sexual arousal in response to donning sex-typical clothing is [[homeovestism]].)

== Description ==
Males with late onset gender dysphoria "frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement," which could include transvestic fetishism. "Habitual fetishistic tranvestism developing into [[autogynephilia]]" is given a risk factor for [[gender dysphoria]] to develop. &lt;ref&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], [[DSM-5|5th ed.]], p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some male transvestic fetishists collect women's [[clothing]], e.g. [[panties]], [[nightgown]]s, [[babydoll]]s, [[bridal gown]]s, [[Slip (clothing)|slips]], [[brassiere]]s, and other types of [[nightwear]], [[lingerie]], [[stockings]], [[pantyhose]], [[shoes]], and [[boots]], items of a distinct feminine look and feel. They may dress in these feminine garments and take photographs of themselves while living out their fantasies. 

According to DSM-IV, this fetishism was limited to [[heterosexual]] men; however, DSM-5 does not have this restriction, and opens it to women and men with this interest, regardless of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf DSM-5 Documents: Paraphilic Disorders Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two key criteria before a psychiatric diagnosis of "transvestic fetishism" is made:&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individuals must be sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing.
# Individuals must experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior.

'''Vacuum evaporation''' is the process of causing the [[pressure]] in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal. Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of [[water]] by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard [[atmospheric pressure]] and causing the water to boil at [[room temperature]].

The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. In addition, there are other technical advantages such as the ability to distill other liquids with high boiling points and avoiding the decomposition of substances that are sensitive to temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Gemma|last2=Cambiella|first2=Ángel|last3=Benito|first3=José M.|last4=Pazos|first4=Carmen|last5=Coca|first5=José|title=The effect of additives on the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions by vacuum evaporation|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=June 2007|volume=144|issue=3|pages=649–654|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
When the process is applied to [[food]] and the water is [[evaporate]]d and removed, the food can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as [[egg whites]] [[coagulating]] when attempting to [[dehydrate]] the [[albumen]] into a powder.

This process was invented by [[Henri Nestlé]] in 1866, of [[Nestlé]] Chocolate fame,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  although the [[Shakers]] were already using a [[vacuum pan]] earlier than that (see [[condensed milk]]).

This process is used industrially to make such food products as [[evaporated milk]] for [[milk chocolate]], and [[tomato paste]] for [[ketchup]].

[[File:Vacuum evaporation plant.jpg|thumb|Vacuum evaporation plant]]
[[File:00-vacuum-pan-sugar-factory.JPG|thumb|right|vacuum pans in a beet sugar factory]]In the sugar industry vacuum evaporation is used in the [[crystallization]] of [[sucrose]] solutions. Traditionally, this process was performed in batch mode, but nowadays continuous vacuum pans are available.&lt;ref&gt;BMA Gruppe. [http://www.bma-worldwide.com/products/sugar-and-sweeteners/vacuum-pans-batch-and-continuous-types-vkt.html Article on continuous vacuum pans.] Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==
Vacuum evaporators are used in a wide range of industrial sectors to treat [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Condorchem Envitech. [http://condorchem.com/en/view/50-Vacuum-evaporators "Vacuum evaporators"] as a technology for industrial water-based liquid waste minimization and treatment. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a clean, safe and very versatile technology having low management costs, which in most cases serves as a zero-discharge treatment system.

==Thin film deposition==
Vacuum evaporation is also a form of [[physical vapor deposition]] used in the [[semiconductor]], [[microelectronics]], and [[optic]]al industries and in this context is a process of depositing [[thin films]] of material onto surfaces.  Such a technique consists of pumping a [[vacuum chamber]] to pressures of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] and heating a material to produce a [[flux]] of [[vapor]] in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its [[vapor pressure]] is high enough to produce a flux of several [[Angstroms]] per second by using an [[electrical]]ly [[resistive]] heater or bombardment by a high [[voltage]] beam.

'''The VizieR Catalogue Service''' is an [[astronomical catalog]] service provided by [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]].

The origin of the VizieR Catalogue Service dates back to 1993 as the ESA [[European Space Information System]] Catalogue Browser. Initially intended to serve the Space Science community, the ESIS project pre-dates the World Wide Web as a network database allowing uniform access to a heterogeneous set of catalogues and data.

The [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] had for years collected and disseminated astronomical data, so the original ESIS Catalogue Browser was transferred to and stored at CDS. Since its inception in 1996, VizieR has become a reference point for astronomers worldwide engaged in research, who come to access catalogued data regularly published in astronomical journals. The new VizieR service was refurbished in 1997 by the CDS to better serve the community in terms of searching capabilities and data volume. As of March 2012 it contains more than 9800 catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier//index.htx#desc VizieR Description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VizieR catalog is now a major data source as part of the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].

      <comment>/* The half-diminished seventh chord in Vogel's Tonnetz */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17429">'''Vogel's Tonnetz''' is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of [[just intonation]], introduced by German music theorist [[Martin Vogel]] 1976 in his book ''Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen'' (english: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). 
The graphical representation is based on [[Tonnetz|Euler's Tonnetz]], adding a third dimension for just [[Harmonic seventh|sevenths]] to the two dimensions for just [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and just [[Major third|thirds]]. 
It serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.
The four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the [[#Consonance and the congruency of harmonics|congruency of harmonics]] of chords depending on the tonal material. 
It can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.

== The graphical representation ==

The graphical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is limited to the three dimensions for fifths, thirds, and seventh. In this representation tones separated by one or several octaves are depicted on the same nodes. The illustration shows the chord which is the most frequent 4-note chord in western music: the major seventh. In Euler's Tonnetz the B-flat is constructed from fifths and thirds. In Vogel's Tonnetz it is given as a just harmonic seventh.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The representation of this chord in Vogel's three-dimensional Tonnetz makes its statistical dominance much more plausible than its representation in Euler's two-dimensional Tonnetz: There is a distinct reference note (C), and all other notes are linked to this reference note via simple one-step intervals in this Tonnetz.

== The mathematical representation ==

The mathematical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is four-dimensional, considering also [[octave]]s.
Each tone is represented by a [[4-tuple|quadruple]] of numbers specifying how many octaves, "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" are needed to reach that tone in the Tonnetz (where the terms "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" denote the prime numbers 3, 5, and 7, instead of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 und 7/4).
The C-major seventh chord with the notes c', e', g', and b-flat' could (with reference to C)be represented by the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
This corresponds to the quadruple (2,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (1,1,0,0), and (0,0,0,1).
The quadruple notations represents the [[prime decomposition]] of the numbers that are needed to describe the chord, limited to the first four prime numbers.

Vogel adopts the harmonic dualism of [[Arthur von Oettingen]], with [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor]] chords being mirror images of each other. This view is complemented by a quantitative computation of [[consonance]] (or rather [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]) values.

[[File:Chords with reference notes.jpg|thumb|C major and C minor chord with upper and lower reference tone]]

For this purpose Vogel introduces virtual reference tones that are not necessarily part of the chord. These reference tones are chosen such that all chord tones have integer relations to these reference tones. For each chord there exists a lower and an upper reference tone, with all chord tones being integer multiples of the frequency of the lower reference tone and integer fractions of the frequency of the upper reference tone. In quadruple notation there are only positive (or zero) values if the chord is related to the lower reference tone, and only negative (or zero) values if the chord is related to the higher reference tone.

To get a single numerical value describing the complexity of a chord, Vogel builds a weighted sum of the quadruples describing the notes of the chord. He suggests the weights 1, 3, 5, and 7 for the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Vogel rejects the more obvious variant where prime number 2 is weighted with 2 because it leads to results that in his opinion do not comply with the perception of musically skilled listeners. Finally, the weighted sum is divided by the number of tones of the chord. This computation is done for both the higher and the lower reference tone. Depending on which of those two values is smaller, the chord is then labeled as "Oberklang" or "Unterklang" ("upper chord", if reference to the lower reference note, or "lower chord", if referenced to the upper reference note).

The C major chord c’-e’-g’ could, for instance, be referenced to C.
All three notes of the triad can be represented as integer multiples of the frequency of this reference tone (4, 5, and 6). 
The prime decomposition yields 2&amp;#x00B7;2,5,2&amp;#x00B7;3. 
Applying the weights suggested by Vogel one obtains a so-called consonance value of (1+1+5+1+3)/3 = 11/3 = 3.67. 
The same chord may also be referenced to b’’’’: this upper reference tone has 15 times the frequency of c’, 12 times the frequency of e’ and ten times the frequency of g’. 
The prime decomposition yields3&amp;#x00B7;5,2&amp;#x00B7;2&amp;#x00B7;3,2&amp;#x00B7;5.
The consonance value computes to (3+5+1+1+3+1+5)/3 = 19/3 = 6,33. 
As the consonance value for the lower reference tone is better (smaller), the c major chord c’-e’-g’ is defined to be an upper chord referenced to C.
The consonance value of the c minor chord c’-es’-g’ is identical.
It is, however, reference to the upper reference tone of this chord, g’’’.
In consequence, Vogel rejects the naming of this chord as C minor as its reference note is not C but G. He calls it "G lower chord".

Vogel suggests a specific notation for upper and lower chords.
The notation starts by denoting the reference tone in lower case.
Upper chords are marked by an "O" (Oberklang) and are denoted from left to right, lower chords are marked by a "U" (Unterklang) and are denoted from right to left.
The C major chord is denoted as cO, the C minor chord is denoted as Ug.
Additional symbols for additional notes (7 for adding an upper or lower seventh) are added to the left or to the right, depending on whether it is an upper or a lower chord. 
The C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord depicted above would be denoted as cO7.

In addition to the calculation of consonance values for single chords, 
Vogel suggests a computation of the consonance of chord transitions.
When transiting from an n-note chord to an m-note chord all N&amp;#x00B7;M note-to-note transitions are evaluated via prime decomposition and weighted sum, and a mean value for all these transitions is computed.
Vogel also suggest to compute a consonance value for an entire piece of music, taking into account a central reference point similar to a [[Gregorian mode|final]].

=== Consonance and the congruency of harmonics ===

The consonance value calculated with Vogel's formula should rather be termed dissonance value, because with increasing dissonance of a chord or interval its value increases.
Vogel did not claim to predict consonance judgments of today's listeners.
A close relation of Vogel's consonance values with consonance judgments is in deed not to be expected.
Firstly, consonance judgments correlate strongly with familiarity judgments.&lt;ref name="Karas"&gt;Agnieszka Karas, Christian Kaernbach: ''Putting Martin Vogel to test: An attempt to evaluate a musical theory.'' In U. Ansorge et al. (Hrsg.): ''Beiträge zur [https://www.teap.de/docs/teap2013_final_programme_updated.pdf 55. Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psychologen.]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF; 11,3&amp;nbsp;MB)'' Pabst Science Publishers, Lengerich, 2013, S. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, major and minor are attributed emotional values by today's Western listeners (minor being perceived as expressing sadness).
Thirdly, his formula considers only the congruency of harmonics, but not the congruency of [[combination tone]]s.
It would be more cautious to say that Vogel's formula correlates with the congruency of harmonics, expressing in how far the harmonics of a chord fit together or not.

The range of the validity of the formula is in addition limited by the limits of hearing.
A just octave cannot be discriminated from an octave that is mistuned by a [[schisma]] (a mistuning of about 2 [[cent (music)|cent]]). The perceptual limit for the frequency difference of complex tones is about 0.25 % (4 cent).&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"&gt;Christian Kaernbach, Christian Bering: ''Exploring the temporal mechanism involved in the pitch of unresolved harmonics.'' In: ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.'' Vol. 110, 2001, S. 1039-1048 ([http://www.emotion.uni-kiel.de/fileadmin/emotion/team/kaernbach/publications/2001_kae_ber_jasa.pdf PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogel's consonance formula yields a consonance value of (1&amp;#x00B7;1+0&amp;#x00B7;3+0&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 0.5 for the just octave (1,0,0,0), and a values of (14&amp;#x00B7;1+8&amp;#x00B7;3+1&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 43/2 = 21.5 for the octave mistuned by a schisma (-14,8,1,0).

=== Consequences for the selection of tones ===
[[File:C minor chord with high and low third.jpg|thumb|C minor chord with high and low third [[File:C minor chord with third high and low.ogg|noicon|40px]]]]

Vogel's consonance formula can help to decide, which tones of the Tonnetz should be taken for a certain chord. The consonance value of the seventh chord in Euler's Tonnetz (see figure above) is 8.5. In Vogel's Tonnetz one could select the same tones, resulting in the same consonance value. If one, however, decides to select the just seventh, the consonance value improves to 4.5. Hence, according to Vogel, the seventh chord using a just seventh is to be preferred over a seventh chord where the seventh is built from fifth and thirds.

=== Compositional consequences ===

Vogel claims that his formula entails also compositional consequences.
If one wants a chord to be consonant, major chords should be composed such that thirds and sevenths are set in a high register.
Minor chords, however, would have to be set the other way round, with thirds and sevenths being set in a low register.
This is by no means compatible with the compositional practice of the last centuries (with perhaps the exception of the Tristan chord, see below).
In consequence, minor chords set along Vogel's composition rules sound unfamiliar.
They exhibit, however, a better congruency of harmonics than their classical variants.
The left-hand of the two C minor chords in the adjoining figure is composed in the classical way, with the third being set in a high register. The consonance value for this chord is 4.33.
The right-hand minor chord features a low third. It sounds unfamiliar. Its consonance value is, however, much lower (3.0), and the congruency of its harmonics is much better.

== Limiting the theory to the prime numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7 ==

Vogel considers the theoretically infinite four-dimensional space of tones of his Tonnetz as complete; no further dimensions are needed for higher prime numbers.
According to his theory, consonance results from the congruency of [[harmonics]]. The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of congruency, as the [[inner ear]] separates only the first eight to ten partials.&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"/&gt; The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as [[Harmonic#Harmonics_on_stringed_instruments|flageolet]]. If presented as part of a complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a congruency with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic congruency for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments. With training it might be possible to detect consonance up to prime number 17 or even 19.

== The half-diminished seventh chord in Vogel's Tonnetz ==

[[File:Tristanvorspiel.jpg|thumb|400px|Beginning of the Prelude of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and Isolde, with the Tristan chord (yellow) and its resolution (blue) [[File:Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|noicon|40px]] ]]
[[File:Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz.gif|framed|The Tristan chord(yellow) and its resolution (blue) in Vogel's Tonnetz, animated]]

The [[Tristan chord]] is a historically important chord in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''Tristan and Isolde''. Its role in [[Diatonic function|functional harmony]] cannot clearly be determined. It is considered to be tonally unsettled and extremely chromatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kurth (Musikwissenschaftler)|Ernst Kurth:]] ''Romantische Harmonik und ihre Krise in Wagners „Tristan“'', Bern 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vogel's Tonnetz this chord appears to be the dual counterpiece of a major seventh chord. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud{{music|#}}, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.

It is not very likely that Vogel's notation for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as lower chord under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as G{{music|#}}m/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.

The "explanation" of the Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz as a well-composed counter-piece of a major seventh chord cannot be compared to an "explanation" in the scope of functional harmony. Both types of explanations cannot really explain why certain chords and chord sequences have established themselves in musical history. Functional harmony focuses on the relation of a chord to the prevailing tonality. In consequence, it cannot explain chord progressions found in late-romantic music where there is no longer a continuous tonality present. In contrast, Vogel's theory focuses more on the congruency of the notes of a single chord, or with the notes of the preceding or subsequent chord than on the role of this chord in the context of a prevailing tonality. Vogel's analysis reveals that the Tristan chord is by no means an attack on the tonal system as such but that it is part of it exactly as its counterpart, the major seventh chord.

A similar chord is also often used by jazz musicians.
There it is commonly notated as a half-diminished seventh chord.
The Tristan chord could hence be noted as Fm&lt;sup&gt;7 b5&lt;/sup&gt;).
This way to describe this chord misses its relation to a G-sharp minor chord.
It results from the practice to describe chords starting from their lowest note.
According to Vogel this is appropriate for upper chords, but not for lower chords.
Lower chords should be described top-down instead of bottom-up.
The principle of starting with the lowest note is not consequently observed in other situations, such as with [[Inverted chord|inverted chords]].
A C major chord in its [[first inversion]] is not typically described as an E minor chord with altered fifth (Em&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Reception ==

Vogel's Tonnetz resorts on a theory (Euler's Tonnetz) that is more than 100 years older than the presently dominating functional harmony.
Vogel's Tonnetz and functional harmony are not in conflict with each other.
On the contrary, they can be seen as complementing each other:
While Vogel's theory focuses on local relations of tones and chords, 
functional harmony considers the global role of a chord in the context of the entire piece of music.
However, the prevalence of functional harmony and the peculiarities of Vogel's notation hamper the general reception.
Vogel's consonance formula has only recently been tested empirically.&lt;ref name="Karas" /&gt; 
Kaernbach suggests a simplified notation:
writing always from left to right, using capital letters for the reference tones (avoiding confusions with the convention to use lowercase letters for minor chords), and using a triangular symbol (&amp;#9650; und &amp;#9660;) to denote upper and lower chords. 
The beginning of the prelude of Tristan and Isolde could then be denoted as 
D&amp;#9660;{{music|#}}7 → E&amp;#9650;7.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kaernbach: ''Honoring Martin Vogel – Champion of just intonation in music.'' In U. Ansorge et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3959">'''Wilhelm Bousset''' (3 September 1865, [[Lübeck]] – 8 March 1920, [[Gießen]]) was a German [[theologian]] and [[New Testament]] scholar. He was of [[Huguenot]] ancestry and a native of [[Lübeck]].

==Biography==
He began his studies at the [[University of Erlangen]], where he met [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1865–1923), with whom he would maintain a friendship that would last throughout his career. Later on, he studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], where he was student of [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851–1930), and afterwards continued his education at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1890 he became a professor of [[New Testament]] exegesis at [[Göttingen]], later relocating to the [[University of Giessen]] (1916).

Bousset was a prominent figure in the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' ([[history of religions school]]), a group that included scholars such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), [[Albert Eichhorn]] (1856–1926) and [[Hermann Gunkel]] (1862–1932). His better known work involved comparative studies between the [[Early Christian Church]] and other religious beliefs, particularly [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Bousset demonstrated in his writings that Christian thought was profoundly influenced by neighboring cultures and belief systems.

== Publications ==
Bousset was a prolific writer, and among his books that were translated into English were ''Kyrios Christos: Geschichte des Christusglaubens von den Anfängen des Christentums bis Irenäus'' (Kyrios Christos; A History of the Belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] from the Beginnings of [[Christianity]] to [[Irenaeus]]), and ''Der Antichrist in Der Uberlieferung Des Judentums, Des Neuen Testaments Und Der Alten Kirche'' ([[Antichrist]] Legend: A Chapter in Christian and Jewish Folklore).
