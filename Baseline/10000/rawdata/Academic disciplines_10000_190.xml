      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">'''Air sex''' is a performance activity invented in [[Japan]]; clothed men and women simulate [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with an invisible partner, often in an exaggerated manner, set to music, and in a competition before an audience. This is somewhat akin to playing [[air guitar]], explaining the name. The creator, ''J-Taro Sugisaku'', says that it was invented in [[Tokyo]] in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. 

A report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine ''Weekly Playboy'' in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site ''[[Mainichi Shimbun|Mainichi Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/09/20060921p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan's air sex world champion licks himself into shape]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mainichi Daily News, 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the air sex "world championship" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22Air+Sex+World+Championship%22 Air Sex World Championship], YouTube, uploaded 2 January 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a segment of the [[BBC Three]] documentary show ''[[Japanorama]]'' in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;
''Japanorama'', Series 3, Episode 2, BBC3, first aired 26 March 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as "inappropriate for some users".

These videos led to coverage in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Japanorama'' video was shown in May 2007 at the [[JACON|JACON 2007]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2FlHwu6EM Air Sex Contest Jacon '07]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves "Peer Pressure" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name "amp6". [[Fleshbot]] called these "The Best Air Sex Video of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;"Peer Pressure" performed their routine in Atlanta as part of the official Air Sex World Championships tour in June 2009.

Since August 2007, The [[Alamo Drafthouse]] has been holding bimonthly Air Sex competitions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fLBraKZ8v0 Air Sex news report on Vimby]
&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009 The Alamo Drafthouse toured the country on the Air Sex World Championships tour crowning Air Sex Champions in 14 cities. Later that October the first ever world champion was crowned when Shanghai Slammer from Los Angeles out-performed every other city champion. The tour was hosted by comedian [[Chris Trew]]. In October 2010 the group will tour once more.  Photos are posted on the Alamo Drafthouse Flickr page.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Australian College of Physical Education''' ('''ACPE''') is an independent specialist [[tertiary education]] institution in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The college offers degree programmes in [[PDHPE]] teaching, [[physical education]], [[sports coaching]], [[health]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]], [[dance]] education, and [[sports management]]. The institute was founded in 1917, and is located at the [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. 

The college was founded in 1917 (making it the fourteenth-oldest tertiary education institution in Australia), initially as a physical education training institution for young women (the college only began admitting male students in 1971). The college's founder was Frank Stuart – a [[swordsman]], [[fencing]] instructor and physical training instructor, who had taught members of both the British and Russian Royal families, and went on to coach the Australian fencing teams for the 1950 [[Empire Games]] and the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]]. The college was initially located within the premises of Normanhurst School in the Sydney suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. It has an early connection with the Swords Club. (a connection recognised today through the college emblem), and in 1919 the club and the college were registered jointly as the ACPE and Swords Club Pty Ltd. 

The college moved to new premises in [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] in 1949, and then to [[Croydon, New South Wales|Croydon]] in 1970. In 1995, the college moved into the Sydney Olympic Park at [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]], where the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]] were held. Students at the college regularly use the Olympic Park's facilities, such as the [[State Sports Centre|Sports Centre]], [[Sydney International Aquatic Centre|Aquatic Centre]] and [[NSW Tennis Centre|Tennis Centre]], for lectures and tutorials. Recently the College has moved to a brand new purpose built campus in Sydney Olympic Park at 10 Parkview Drive.

==Courses==
The College currently offers 12 Undergraduate Degrees and 1 Post- Graduate Diploma:

* Bachelor of Applied Dance
* Bachelor of Dance Education
* Bachelor of Applied Fitness
* Bachelor of Health &amp; Movement
* Bachelor of Education (PHE)
* Bachelor of Health Science (Exercise)

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D.

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans. [[Charlotte Mandell]]|title=The Body Politic: Corporeal Metaphor in Revolutionary France, 1770-1800|page=xv|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-2817-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">'''Casualty estimation''' is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths in a battle or natural disaster that has already occurred.  On the other, [[casualty prediction]] is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths that might occur in a planned or potential battle or natural disaster.

Measures used to imply casualties include:
* Reported number of kills
* Number of enemy individual weapons captured after engagement
* Number of tanks and aircraft lost
* Remote sensing of mass graves

==Methods==

[[MASINT|Measurement and signature intelligence]] alone cannot give a reasonable estimate of casualties. What [[Electro-optical MASINT#Spectroscopic MASINT|Spectroscopic MASINT]] can do is help find mass graves. [[Geophysical MASINT]] can help localize metal and possibly bodies at that site. [[TECHINT]] is needed if there are weapons or artifacts to analyze.  IMINT has a role to play in  tracking movements. These all have to combine with all-source analysis. Perhaps the losses of tanks and aircraft, if available, might better predict what actually happened in a battle. [[Electro-optical MASINT#Mass graves|MASINT's mass graves capability]] is a means that has been used for remote sensing of clandestine mass graves.

Author Sam Adams' book, ''War of Numbers'' discusses, in great detail, a process of casualty estimation.  Adams was a CIA analyst who eventually resigned over what he felt was political manipulation of casualty figures in the [[Vietnam War]]. He explains how he came up with casualty figures for the NLF and PAVN.  Adams, and other U.S. analysts dealing with a guerilla war in jungle, found there were better metrics than "body count". [[David Hackworth]], for example, used number of enemy weapons captured after an engagement, and that turned out to be a good predictor of casualties, with certain limits.

==Earthquakes==
{{main|Earthquake casualty estimation}}
Recent advances are improving the speed and accuracy of loss estimates immediately after [[earthquakes]] (within less than an hour) so that injured people may be rescued more efficiently. After major and large earthquakes, rescue agencies and [[civil defense]] managers rapidly need quantitative estimates of the extent of the potential disaster, at a time when information from the affected area may not yet have reached the outside world. For the injured below the rubble every minute counts.
To rapidly provide estimates of the extent of an earthquake disaster is much less of a problem in industrialized than in developing countries. This article focuses on how one can estimate earthquake losses in developing countries in real time.

==Woman of the Apocalypse==
[[Image:10 Inmaculada Concepción (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|Diego Velázquez's ''Immaculate Conception'' 1618.]]
The [[New Testament]]'s [[Book of Revelation]] (12:1, 2 &amp; 5) describes the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]: ''And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth .... And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title= New Testament Revelation 12:1, &amp; 5
  | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:1&amp;version=31;
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition she has been identified with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], especially in connection with the [[Immaculate Conception]].  Mary is often pictured with a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revelation of St John|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/d/durer/2/12/2apocaly/00title2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Circle of Stars.

The doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] was somewhat controversial in the medieval church, and the liturgical Office for the feast was only established in 1615.  In 1649, [[Francisco Pacheco]] (father-in-law of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]) published his ''Art of Painting'' firmly establishing the detailed correct iconography for paintings of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, which included the circle of stars (he also advised the [[inquisition]] in Seville on artistic matters).  This was followed by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and his school in very many paintings, and influenced non-Spanish depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coleccionbbva.com/media/files/P02146_Detailed%20analysis.pdf|title=Circle of stars Detailed analysis|publisher=www.coleccionbbva.com|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduqna.com/Other/1539-general-5.html|title=What do the 12 stars |publisher=www.eduqna.com|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Flag==
{{further|Flag of Europe}}
The European flag consists of 12 golden stars in a circle on a blue background. The stars symbolise the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/flag/index_en.htm|title=The European Flag|publisher=The European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries, though the circle is a symbol of unity.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;
The European flag, first adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] is the symbol of [[Europe]]'s unity and identity in a wider sense, as well as the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

[[Arsène Heitz]], one of the flag designers, in 1987 revealed that his inspiration was the crown of twelve stars of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], often found in modern [[Marian iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=3332056|title=Real politics, at last|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2004-10-28|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not suggest that the finished design held a religious meaning.
[[Paul M. G. Lévy]], the official responsible the design process, denied any religious inspiration for the flag design.&lt;ref name="Gialdino"&gt;

"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. Lévy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars." Peter Diem, 11 June 2002
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the European Parliament adopted the flag. In 1985, it was adopted by all EU leaders as the official emblem of the European Communities, and in 1993 inherited by the successor organisation, the European Union. All European institutions now use an emblem of their own.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

==Zodiac==
[[Image:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|6th century synagogue Zodiac, Beit Alpha, Israel]]
The [[Zodiac]] is an ancient ''circle of stars''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreyarmstrong.com/starbasedastrology.htm Jeffrey Armstrong | A Western Master of Eastern Wisdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608092248/http://www.jeffreyarmstrong.com/starbasedastrology.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where some stars are [[symbol]]ically combined into 12 [[Star signs]] also known as [[constellation]]s. The etymology of the term [[Zodiac]] comes from the Latin zōdiacus, from the Greek ζῳδιακός [κύκλος], meaning "[circle] of animals", derived from ζῴδιον, the diminutive of ζῷον "animal".

==Crown of Immortality==
The [[Crown of Immortality]] is a separate and earlier motif (and [[metaphor]]) which also uses a circle of stars.  It has been widely used since the Early Church as a metaphor for the reward awaiting martyrs, but they are not depicted in art wearing a circle of stars.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In art the use is mainly in Baroque allegorical compositions, and those with [[Ariadne]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27305">"'''Communication Theory as a Field'''" is a 1999 article by [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]], attempting to unify the academic field of [[communication theory]].{{sfn|Craig|1999}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}

Craig argues that communication theorists can become unified in dialogue by charting what he calls the "dialogical dialectical tension", or the similarities and differences in their understanding of "communication" and demonstrating how those elements create tension within the field.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}}  Craig mapped these similarities and differences into seven suggested traditions of communication theory and showed how each of these traditions understand communication, as well as how each traditions understanding creates tension with the other traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-149}}

The article has received multiple awards,&lt;ref name="international communication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCA" /&gt; has become the foundation for many communication theory textbooks,{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} and has been translated into several different languages.{{sfn|Craig|2009b}}&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt;

"Communication theory as a field" has created two main dialogues between Craig and other theorists. Myers argued that Craig misrepresented the theoretical assumptions of his theory, and that the theory itself does not distinguish between good and bad theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001}} Craig responded that Myers misunderstood not only the basic argument of the article, but also misrepresented his own case study.{{sfn|Craig|2001}} Russill proposed pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication theory,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Russill|2005}} Craig responded by expanding this idea and placing Russill's proposition in conversation with the other seven traditions.{{sfn|Craig|2007}}

==Recognition and awards==
"Communication Theory as a Field" has been recognized by multiple associations for its influence upon the field of communication.  These awards include the Best Article Award from the [[International Communication Association]]&lt;ref name="international communication"&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association Awards |publisher=[[International Communication Association]] |year=2003 |url=http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=Jan 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164948/http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Golden Anniversary Monograph Award from the [[National Communication Association]].&lt;ref name="NCA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Communication Association Awards|publisher =[[National Communication Association]]|year=2001|url= http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/Images/NCAawards2001.pdf|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That work has since been translated into French{{sfn|Craig|2009b}} and Russian.&lt;ref name="vita"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Robert |last=Craig |title=Robert Craig Vita |publisher=University of Colorado |date=Feb 3, 2011 |url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf |accessdate=Feb 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062414/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory presented in "Communication Theory as a Field" has become the basis of the book "Theorizing Communication" which Craig co-edited with Heidi Muller,{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}} as well as being adopted by several other communication theory textbooks as a new framework for understanding the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}

==Metamodel==
Sparked by the "[[Great Debates (international relations)|Third Debate]]" within the field of International Relations Theory in the 1980s, "Communication Theory as a Field" expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig "proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities."{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how "various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication."{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the "practical implications of communication theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of communication theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}

Craig argues that while the study of communication and communication theory has become a rich and flourishing field "Communication theory as an identifiable field of study does not yet exist" and the field of communication theory has become fragmented into separate domains which simply ignore each other.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=119-120}} This inability to engage in dialog with one another causes theorists to view communication from isolated viewpoints, and denies them the richness that is available when engaging different perspectives.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Craig argues that communication theorists are all engaging in the study of practical communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} By doing so different traditions are able to have a common ground from which a dialog can form, albeit each taking a different perspective of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Through this process of forming a dialog between theorists with different viewpoints on communication "communication theory can fully engage with the ongoing practical discourse (or metadiscourse) about communication in society."{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}}

The communication discipline began not as a single discipline, but through many different disciplines independently researching communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} This interdisciplinary beginning has separated theorists through their different conceptions of communication, rather than unifying them in the common topic of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120-123}} Craig argues that the solution to this incoherence in the field of communication is not a unified theory of communication, but to create a dialogue between these theorists which engages these differences with one another to create new understandings of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-125}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=76}}

To achieve this dialog Craig proposes what he calls "Dialogical-Dialectical coherence," or a "common awareness of certain complementaries and tensions among different types of communication theory."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig believes that the different theories cannot develop in total isolation from one another, therefore this dialogical-dialectical coherence will provide a set of background assumptions from which different theories can engage each other in productive argumentation.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig argues for a [[metatheory]], or "second level" theory which deals with "first level" theories about communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=126-127}}  This second level metamodel of communication theory would help to understand the differences between first level communication traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-132}} With this thesis in place, Craig proposes seven suggested traditions of communication that have emerged and each of which have their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}
#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}
#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}
#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}
#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}
#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}
#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}
#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}

These proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed on two separate tables{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each traditions different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}  Craig then outlines the specifics of each tradition.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-149}}

===Conclusion===

Craig concluded with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as "connectedness to others", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as "embodied performance", an economic tradition theorizing communication as "exchange", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a "nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}

==Response==

===Myers, constitutive metamodel, and truth===
In 2001 Myers, a [[computer-mediated communication]] scholar from [[Loyola University New Orleans]], criticizes Craig's ideas in "A Pox on All Compromises: A reply to Craig (1999)."{{sfn|Myers|2001}}  Myers makes two main arguments against Craig's article. Myers argues that Craig misrepresents the metamodel, and that the lack of any critical truth within Craigs construction is problematic for the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219}}{{sfn|Craig|2007}} The metamodel is misrepresented by unjustly arguing that there is a separation between first and second level constitutive models while hiding the paradox within this statement, and that it privileges the constitutive model rather than another theoretical conception.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219-123, 226}} Next Myers argues that Craig fails to draw any way to discern truth within the theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=222-223}} Using a case study regarding the rise and fall of [[technological determinism]] among computer-mediated communication scholars,{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Myers argues that a metamodel needs to provide some mechanism that will "reduce misrepresentation and mistake" in evaluating theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}} Myers frames Craig's ideas of collective discourse without an evaluative criteria of what is good theory and bad theory as [[The Hatter|"a Mad Hatter's tea party"]] which will "allow all to participate in this party of discourse" but will not be able to "inform any of the participants when it is time to leave."{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}}

====Craig's response to Myers====

Craig responded, in "an almost [[William James|Jamesian]] reply",{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} that Myers criticisms were not founded in actual inconsistencies within Craigs argument.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} Rather they were founded in the difference between Myers and Craig's "respective notions of truth and the proper role of [[Empiricism|empirical truth]] as a criterion for adjudicating among theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} In regard to Myers first claim that the separation between first level theories and second level metatheory is paradoxical and therefore an inaccurate or misguided distinction, Craig admits that there is a paradox inherent within a separation between first order theories and metatheory but "slippage between logical levels is an inherent feature (or bug) of communication, and we should not forget that theory is, among other things, communication. "{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} Craig cites [[Gregory Bateson]] as pointing out that while the [[Double bind#Theory of logical types|theory of logical types]] forbids the mixing of different "levels" to avoid paradox, "practical communication necessarily does exactly that."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}}  Actual communication is fraught with paradox, and while a logicians ideal would have us try and resolve these paradoxes, in actual practice we don't because there is no way to do so.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} In actually occurring communication people employ different means of dealing with this paradox, but resolving the paradox is not a possible solution.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} Craig argues that Myers has been unable to prove any inconsistency or misrepresentation when it came to using the constitutive model for his metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234-235}} Rather than trying to subvert every other theory to a constitutional model, Craig used the constitutive model not for some theory of truth or logical necessity, but because the constitutive model pragmatically will accomplish the goal of the project, that of opening up a space from which competing theories of communication can interact.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} With this the constitutional model will be able to maintain a theoretical cosmopolitanism.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236}}

On the second argument that the metamodel lacks any empirical truth criteria, Craig argues that not only did Myers miss the point of the metamodel by claiming it should evaluate the truth of theories{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236-237}} but that Myers own case study fails to back up his point.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236,238}} The metamodel itself does not distinguish the falseness of other models.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} However, contrary to Myers claim, the metamodel does allow theorists engaged in discussion to judge the validity of theories "on the basis of empirical evidence in ordinary reasonable ways."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} What the metamodel does deny is a universally established absolute truth in the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=230}} Craig points out that Myers was correct in that the metamodel is ill-equipped to judge theories as valid or invalid, it also doesn't do a good job of closing "the Antarctic ozone hole or solve other problems for which it was not designed."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} The case study that Myers presents is the debate about [[technological determinism]] in the realm of Computer Mediated Communication.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Craig points out that this debate occurred between [[Social psychology (sociology)|social scientific]] researchers.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This type of research has a shared commitment to [[empirical research]] methods.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} So in spite of already possessing a shared truth criteria, these researchers failed to prevent errors Myers hopes would be avoided by holding onto a form of absolute truth.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This case study would be a good critique of empirical truth but "how it supports a critique of the constitutive metamodel is less than apparent."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} By relying upon this case study Myers sabotages his argument for establishing an absolute truth criteria, demonstrating that "we would gain little by holding on to such a criterion."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}}

=== Russill, pragmatism as an eighth tradition ===
After this exchange between Myers and Craig, there was no real disciplinary discussion of the metamodel{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a|pp=7}} besides textbooks which used the metamodel as a framework for introducing the field.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}
Then in 2004 in an unpublished dissertation,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} which was mentioned in a footnote in his 2005 "The road not Taken: William James's Radical Empiricism and Communication Theory,"{{sfn|Russill|2005}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} Russill proposed the possibly of [[pragmatism]] as an eighth tradition of [[communication studies]].{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=296-298}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a}}  This was attempted by using "Craig's rules" for the requirements of a tradition in communication theory{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} which Russill formulates as "a problem formulation..., an initial vocabulary..., and arguments for the plausibility of this viewpoint in relation to prevailing traditions of theory."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=133}}

Russill did not write his dissertation with the goal of constructing a tradition of communication theory, rather he was attempting to "resuscitate and reconstruct [[John Dewey|Dewey's]] theory of the public as a pragmatist theory of democratic communication."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=iii, 5, 68-105, 279-283}}  To accomplish this goal Russill places Dewey in conversation with a variety of theorists including [[William James]], [[John Locke]], [[James W. Carey|James Carey]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and [[Walter Lippmann]] among others.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004}}  Russill makes the argument that the pragmatist tradition "conceptualizes communication in response to the problem of incommensurability."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Incommensurability being how a pluralistic society can engage in cooperation when there is an absence "of common, absolute standards for resolving differences."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Russill briefly attempted to construct a pragmatist tradition of communication only to establish Dewey's theory of the public within that tradition.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}  To do this he outlines pragmatism as a tradition that identifies the problem formulation as "incommensurability", and the vocabulary as "democracy, publics, power, criticism, response-ability, triple contingency."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}

====Craig's response to Russill====

Craig responds to this in "Pragmatism in the Field of Communication Theory" and mentions that while Russill "does not entirely follow 'Craig's Rules'" for a new tradition of communication theory, Russill "does define a pragmatist tradition in terms of a distinct way of framing the problem of communication and articulates premises that make the tradition theoretically and practically plausible."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}  Craig points out that Russill is not the first communication theorists who writes on pragmatism, however he is the first to use the constitutive metamodel to define it as a tradition of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}  This conception of pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication studies allows a new space for theories, which Craig identified as either ambiguously placed or neglected, to "immediately snap into focus as contributors to a distinct [pragmatic] tradition."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}

To fully outline a new tradition of communication theory, Russill would have had to fully incorporate that tradition within the dialogical-dialectical matrix.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Russill failed to fully consider the full range of criticism which would occur between the Pragmatist tradition and the other traditions of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Craig uses the dialogical-dialectical matrix to outline how pragmatism could be incorporated into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135-137}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Criminal tradition''' - of the cultural transmission of criminal values. Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society.

Studies of the criminal tradition involved  Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay. They put forward a theory of “cultural transmission”, focuses on the development in some urban neighborhoods of a criminal tradition that persists from one generation to another despite constant changes in population. This theory stresses the value systems of different areas

Also worth noting theory of “differential association,” in which  Edwin H. Sutherland described the processes by which criminal values are taken over by the individual. Edwin H. Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.&lt;ref&gt;Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of  larger cities.  According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn J. R. Subcultures, violence, and the subculture of violence: An old rut or a new road? //Criminology. – 1971. – Т. 9. – №. 1. – С. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population categories subject to criminal traditions ==

Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it;
* New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past.

At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.

== World criminal tradition ==

On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. 
We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on [[The Numbers Gang|the numbers gangs]] of South Africa

== Alternative opinions ==

There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian criminal tradition == 

In Russian criminal tradition adherents of the criminal (criminal) tradition are characterized by active participation in the life of the "thieves' community"; Living on tangible assets obtained by criminal means; Propaganda of "thieves' customs and traditions, as well as criminal way of life; Compulsion to keep a word not only before the "brother", but also the criminal-criminal world; Organization of collection of "obschekovyh" funds and control over their use; Guardianship and assistance to detainees and convicts, the so-called "vagabonds" and "honest prisoners"; Compliance with the decisions of "gatherings"; Demanding of "brotherhood" and control over their compliance; Organization of counteraction to state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/cvetnaya-mast-elita-prestupnogo-mira-read-10956-1.html ВМЕСТО ПРЕДИСЛОВИЯ "ВОРЫ В ЗАКОНЕ" — ИСТОРИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ] RuLit&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">The '''derbfine''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|d|ɛr|ᵻ|ˈ|v|iː|n|ᵻ}}, {{lang-ga|dearbhfhine}} {{IPA-ga|dʲaɾˠəˈvˠiɲə}}, from ''derb'' 'real' + ''fine'' 'group of persons of the same family or kindred,' thus literally 'true kin'&lt;ref&gt;electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language s.v. [http://www.dil.ie/search?search_in=headword&amp;q=derbfine derbḟine]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a term for [[patrilineality|patrilineal group]]s and power structures defined in the first written tracts in [[Early Irish law]]. Its principal purpose was as an institution of property inheritance, with property redistributed on the death of a member to those remaining members of the derbfine. Comprising all the patrilineal descendants over a four-generation group with a common great-grandfather, it gradually gave way to a smaller three-generation kinship group, called the ''gelfine''.

Within a [[clan]], on the death of its chief or king, the surviving members of its derbfine would elect from their number a new chief and/or elect his successor, or ''[[Tánaiste]]'' (in English, his [[Tanistry|Tanist]]). A larger number of clan members, either allies or cousins who were too distantly related to be members of the derbfine, would not have a direct say in such an election. The frequent recitations of a clan's [[genealogy]] by its [[bard]]s was therefore a reminder of who was currently in or out of the clan's derbfine as much as it was a claim to ancient lineages.

Professor [[Francis John Byrne]] of [[University College Dublin]] also identified an ''indfine'' system used in some clans before the year 1000, with membership going back to a common great-great-great-grandfather, perhaps necessary at a time of frequent warfare.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Comparative systems==
In [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|later Anglo-Saxon England]], princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible for the kingship were known as [[ætheling]]s. In Wales, an [[edling]] was the term for an accepted [[heir apparent]] of a reigning Welsh monarch.

The inheritance of the Norman royal line on the death of [[Stephen, King of England]] and his succession by his cousin, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], is similar. Stephen's son was disinherited by consent and Henry was chosen as the equivalent of [[tanistry|tánaiste]] or next chieftain and succeeded to the English throne in 1154. The system was again attempted during the incapacity of [[Henry VI of England]], when the [[House of York]] obtained the support of some royal cousins to take the throne in 1461. By then the norm in Europe was the system of [[primogeniture]], which led on to the turbulent succession crises and policies of [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1527–36.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">{{jargon|date=March 2017}}'''Digital morphogenesis''' is a type of generative art in which complex shape development, or [[morphogenesis]], is enabled by computation. This concept is applicable in many areas of design, art, architecture, and modeling.  The concept was originally developed in the field of [[biology]], later in [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[architecture]].  

In [[architecture]], it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko (2000). 'Digital Morphogenesis and Computational Architectures', in ''Proceedings of the 4th Conference of Congreso Iberoamericano de Grafica Digital, SIGRADI 2000 - Construindo (n)o Espaço Digital (Constructing the Digital Space)'', Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 25–28 September 2000, ed. by José Ripper Kós, Andréa Pessoa Borde and Diana Rodriguez Barros, pp. 98-103 [http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/4077.content.pdf]

Parallels can be seen in [[emergence|emergent properties]] and [[self-organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Environmental health ethics''' is a field of study that combines environmental health policies and ethical consideration towards a mutually acceptable goal. Given the myriad of environmental issues facing society today a sound ethical background can be applied in an attempt to reach a compromise between conflicting interests, like [[anthropocentrism]], global stewardship, religious values, economic development, and public health. A small sample of the scientific disciplines involved in environmental health ethics include: [[ecology]], [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]], and [[exposure biology]].

==Ethical approaches==

===[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] theories===

===[[Christian]] ethics===

===Natural rights===

===[[Kantianism]]===

===John Stuart Mill's [[Utilitarianism]]===

===Richard Brandt's [[Richard Brandt|Utilitarianism]]===

===W. D. Ross's [[W. D. Ross|view]]===

==Environmental health topics==

Environmental health embodies a wide range of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues can be traced back to a moral obligation towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma [[social justice]], equality, sustainability, and [[globalism]] to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the volume of issues at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.

# State the question or problem.
# Gather the relevant information.
# Explore different opinions.
# Apply ethical principles to the different options.
# Resolve any conflicts among ethical principles.
# Take action.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and DeMarco 2000; Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Shamoo and Resnik 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling on a methodology for analyzing different ethical situations we can turn to a broad survey of some of the most relevant issues which face humanity today.

==Pest control==
[[Pesticide]]s are used throughout the world in an attempt to control, repel, or kill pest species. Though many species of insect can be commonly identified throughout the world, others may harm human health and well-being while providing a benefit to the overall environment of an area. One example of the phenomenon is a bee's ability to sting an individual who may have a serious allergic reaction, though they also play a crucial role in the pollination of an ecosystem. A further example would be various species of bat, which though they can transmit rabies, also help to control mosquito populations.
 
Perhaps the biggest event in the history of pesticide use is the widespread use of [[DDT]] to control various pests, including mosquitoes and lice. Its long-term effects had not been sufficiently documented and thus it was assumed to be of low toxicity. Over time the widespread use of DDT began to have serious environmental and human health consequences. Organisms further up the food chain showed significant amounts of DDT in their tissues and this presence had adverse health effects, for example, the weakening of predatory bird eggshells and fish kills. Adverse effects among humans included endocrine system disruption which can lead to reproductive complications.

Among the most disruptive pesticides are those dubbed [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) which do not break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation referred to as the Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[toxaphene]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With these considerations in place it falls onto lawmakers to regulate responsible use of pesticides, and ethics can provide a starting point to consider the best option. Extensive use of pesticides would improve life in the short-term but be harmful in the long-term, and completely banning their use would likewise be detrimental to overall environmental and human health. One strategy to encourage is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM), in which pesticides are responsibly used to limit agricultural loss but also watched for growing resistance and environmental toxicity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also taken measured to educate clinicians and the public about relevant issues and the best ways to manage pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic engineering, food, and nutrition==
[[Genetic engineering]] concerns the application of scientific alteration of plant and animal DNA in order to combat pests, disease, drought, and other factors which can adversely harm the organism. Objections to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) include theological (playing God) and economic (GMOs can be costly) viewpoints. Genetic engineering of both plants and animals must pass through FDA legislation, which may include public labeling of the product or otherwise marking it as genetically modified.

Food and nutrition also fall under the category of things regulated by the FDA, however, the ethics of this regulation are not always clear. Health consequences of unsafe food, eating in overlarge quantities, are well documented yet in all societies there is no legislation against over-consumption. Ethical properties of utilitarianism and [[social justice]] conflict with humanity's freedom of choice in the determining of access to healthy, safe food.

==Pollution and waste==
Air, water, and solid waste pollution are environmental health issues which can adversely affect people, plants, and animals. From an ethical standpoint many things about pollutants can be studied, like questions of disposal, storage, recycling, and responsibility. A few examples of air pollutants include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and [[toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Perhaps the largest ethical debate concerning [[air pollution]] is how to balance economic development against the interests of the [[public health]], safety, and cleanliness. With both sides offering benefits and drawbacks it can be difficult to establish an acceptable compromise. Legislation enacted to prevent widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons, which cause significant environmental damage, can be seen as one instance of economic development taking a lower priority to public health.

Water pollution is another type of widespread contaminant which has ethical implications in mitigating the source and balancing conflicting priorities. The two types of water contaminants are anthropogenic compounds (generally referred to as pollutants, such as disinfection products, metals, municipal and agricultural waste, and petroleum and coal hydrocarbons) and natural contaminants (such as microorganisms or chemicals like arsenic and nitrogen, which are naturally present in the soil). the common misconception is that chemicals leaking into the soil will be diluted over time and rendered harmless. This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination.

Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, [[electronic waste]], hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located.

==Chemical regulation==
[[Chemical regulation]], including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied. This lack of research argues that cautionary use of these products is warranted, especially when short-term effects include harmful symptoms. In opposition to this caution is the nanotechnology industry which is growing very rapidly and may be able to alleviate many of the problems facing society today, like selective cancer treatment and the energy crisis. Perhaps the largest obstacle to testing occurs with the sheer diversity of nanoparticles, of which the only unifying factor is their minuscule size.

'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''Giorgi Chubinashvili''' ({{lang-ka|გიორგი ჩუბინაშვილი}}; November 21, 1885 – January 14, 1973) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[art historian]].

Born in [[St. Petersburg]], he studied [[psychology]] at the universities of [[Leipzig]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1907–12), and Georgian-[[Armenian language|Armenian]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] philology at the [[Petrograd University]] (1916–17). Returning to Georgia, he served as a professor at the [[Tbilisi State University]] (1918–31, 1937–48). He was one of the founding fathers and the first rector of [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]] (former Fine Arts (1922–28). From 1941 until his death, he directed the Institute of the History of Georgian Arts at the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] (now the National Centre for Georgian Art History and Heritage Preservation) which has been named after him. His works are chiefly focused on medieval Georgian and Armenian architecture, as well as on wall painting and sculpture.

Released in 2016, '''Guess the Correlation''' is a minimalistic [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[game with a purpose]] developed by Omar Wagih at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]].&lt;ref name=Yong&gt;{{cite news |title=The 8-Bit Game That Makes Statistics Addictive |author=Ed Yong |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/the-8-bit-game-that-makes-statistics-addictive/475848/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]] |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagih&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guessthecorrelation.com|title=Guess the Correlation|author=Omar Wagih|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed to study human perception in scatter plots.&lt;ref name=Tarran&gt;{{cite news |title=A game about correlations that's more than just fun |author=Brian Tarran |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/the-statistics-dictionary/2675-a-game-about-correlations-that-s-more-than-just-fun |newspaper=[[Significance (magazine)|Significance]] |date=9 February 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables and are asked to guess how positively correlated they are. Guesses closer to the real correlation, are rewarded more points. The game features both single and two-player modes and has a retro 8-bit design and sound effects.&lt;ref name=Yong&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Condliffe&gt;{{cite news |title=This 8-Bit Guess-the-Correlation Game Is Way More Fun Than It Should Be |author=Jamie Condliffe |url=https://gizmodo.com/this-8-bit-guess-the-correlation-game-is-way-more-fun-t-1756336680 |newspaper=[[Gizmodo]] |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collected guesses are used to better understand how humans perceive correlations in scatter plots by identifying features within scatter plots, such as outliers, that cause players to over or under estimate the true correlation.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

By 1 February 2016, over 2 million guesses had been collected from 100,000 participants.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

==Gameplay==



In the single-player mode, players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables. The aim is to guess the true [[Pearson correlation coefficient]], where the guess can range from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Players start out with three lives and no points. Guesses made within 0.05 of the true correlation are awarded a life and five points. Guesses made within 0.10 are awarded one point, and guesses over 0.10 are not awarded any points and a life is deducted. The game ends when the player has run out of lives.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

In the two player mode, opponents challenge each other at guessing the true correlation. Once a session has been initiated between two players, both players are presented with the same scatter plot. The player with the closest guess to true correlation is awarded a point. In the event of a draw, no points are awarded to either player. The first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

[[File:Michelle Borromeo Actor Headshots 30.jpg|thumb|180px|Head shot of actress]] 
A '''head shot''' or '''headshot''' is a modern (mostly digital files ) [[portrait]] where the focus is on the person. The term is usually applied for professional profile images on social media, the 'about us page' or a corporate website and promotional pictures of [[actor]]s, [[model (profession)|models]], and [[author]]s. 

==Entertainment industry==
In [[theater]], film, and [[television]], [[actor]]s, [[Model (person)|models]], [[singers]], and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. These head shots are usually more artistic: they intend to portray the subject in the best possible light.&lt;ref name="popphoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2015/04/tips-pro-peter-hurley-high-end-headshot-photography|title=Tips From a Pro: Peter Hurley on High-End Headshot Photography|last=Kolonia|first=Peter|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Popular Photography|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center.  A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called "looks". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person’s shoulders are called "three-quarter" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/headshots/taking-your-best-shot/|title=Taking Your Best Shot|last=Sanville|first=Michael|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Backstage|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors' head shots, when printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8"×10" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.

The main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very "neutral" looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.

Head shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.

==Modeling industry==
[[File:Modelling Headshot by Headshot London Photography.jpg|thumb|180px|Modelling headshot]]
Modeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Modeling head shots are usually used for:
* Comp cards or tear sheets
* Modeling portfolios
* TV advertisements for skin products
* Magazine advertisements for creams and other skin or hair products
* Online industry profiles

Models' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.

[[Comp card]]s are one of the cornerstones of a model’s “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all 
comp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images. A model may have four to five images on the comp card and at least one of these images will be a head shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Corporate and business head shots==
[[File:Corporate Headshot of Douglas Anderson.jpg|alt=|thumb|269x269px|Example of corporate head shot featuring entrepreneur and business coach Douglas Anderson of DA Talent]]
Corporate head shots are portraits often produced digitally and used for engaging in social media, the 'about us' page and industry specialty sites. A ''headshot'' or ''head shot'' is often used for branding and to showcase the executive team, style and personality.  Corporations will use the headshot to merge branding between the people working for them and its agency. 

Corporate head shots serve a variety of purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artofheadshots.com/professional-profile-picture/|title=Professional profile picture|last1=Locke|first1=David|date=October 26, 2017|website=artofheadshots.com|publisher=Business professional specialized in headshot photography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding headshots==
Branding headshots may be a corporate or business headshot with the difference being that the image is designed to convey the individual's or a corporate branding identity. A corporation may chose a streamlined background for all its headshots while an individual may chose an action, experience or background objects to identify his or her brand. Large corporations, firms and/or agencies will usually have a manual for the type and style of headshot to be photographed.

The term "'''interspecies family'''" refers to a group consisting of at least two members of different species who deeply care for each other. Examples include a human and their dog, a couple and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family.  For instance, "interspecies family" may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a "pet", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership.

Most often this is used to discuss non-human interspecies families, typically where a mother of one species will foster a youngling from a different species. With the more recent growth of the fields of [[anthrozoology]] and [[animal studies]], this is being used more frequently to refer especially to bonds between human and non-human animals. 
 
== History and use ==

=== Anthropomorphism ===
Some of the earliest instances of the interspecies family involve the use of [[anthropomorphism]], such as in the children's book ''[[Stuart Little]]'' in which a mouse is a member of a human family. This is a fairly common idea which led to some of the first uses of "interspecies family" in media targeted towards children.

=== Non-human animal relationships ===
There is also a popular trend in books and internet sites that involves capturing photographs and stories of interspecies non-human animal families.  These heartwarming cases promote the idea that animals can look past such differences. However, in these cases they are more often referred to as "interspecies adoptions", "interspecies pairings", and "interspecies friendships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nobel|first=Oliver|title=Interspecies Animal Friendships Will Warm Your Heart (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/interspecies-animal-friendships_n_1556674.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human and non-human animal relationships ===
Just recently, the term has been used to describe non-fiction situations involving human and non-human animal relationships. In 2011 a dissertation was written by Avigdor Edminster entitled ''"'This Dog Means Life': Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edminster|first=Avigdor|title="This Dog Means Life": Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107791/1/Edminster_umn_0130E_11975.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;   in which "Interspecies families" is used frequently.  There have been other instances since then, but they have been strictly within academic works.

In the fall of 2013, The National Museum of Animals &amp; Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Animals and Society|url=http://www.museumofanimals.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created the exhibit entitled {{'}}''My Dog Is My Home: The Experience of Human-Animal Homelessness''{{'}}. The exhibit explores the experience of being homeless with an animal, and specifically the needs that are unmet because of homeless services' failure to recognize the legitimacy of the human-animal bond and their status as an "interspecies family". The exhibit helped popularize the phrase "interspecies family" among its animal protection audience as well as among social service providers. Part of the museum's mission is to promote this idea of inter-species families and make the general public more aware of the strong bonds that can be shared between human and non-human animals.

'''''Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur''''' was painted by Polish Jewish artist [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] in 1878. It depicts [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] in the midst of the [[Yom Kippur]] service, on one of the holiest days of the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]].

Yom Kippur is the Jewish holiday of repentance, a time for Jews to repent for their sins and reflect on their behaviour in the past and coming year. As Soussloff writes in Jewish Identity in Modern Art History, “Yom Kippur is also the occasion in the Jewish year when the dead are solemnly commemorated (in the service called [[Yizkor]]), and Gottlieb has injected into this picture several prominent self-memorials.” In his book Painting a People, [[Ezra Mendelsohn]] confirms that Gottlieb’s subject in this painting is the Days of Atonement: “Nathan Samuely, who discussed the work with Gottlieb in 1878, does specifically connect it, in his German essay on the artist published in 1885, with Yom Kippur, and informs us that the artist himself had the idea of painting it during the days of repentance preceding this holiday.”

The painting is composed of glazed (semi-transparent) oil paint. Gottlieb used the technique of impasto (wide, three-dimensional brushstrokes), and physically created patterns from the paint. This contributes to the painting's richness and depth.

==Content==
The figures in the painting appear solemn, and some appear to be in anguish, particularly the central figure (the artist himself), leaning his head on his hand. The adult men are wearing [[talith|tallitot]] (ritual garments often referred to in English as prayer shawls) and [[Kippah|kippot]] (head coverings). There is a [[Torah scroll]] in the center of the composition, stained glass windows in the back, and candles on the top left. Women look on from the [[Mechitza|women's balcony]]; it has been suggested that one of the women is a depiction of Laura, the artist's fiancée.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur |url=http://www.tamuseum.org.il/en/collection-work/8224 |website=Tel Aviv Museum of Art |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist Maurycy Gottlieb appears in the painting three different times, depicted in different stages of his life. In one self-portrait he is an adult, in another he is a young child, and in the third self-portrait he is depicted as an adolescent. Ezra Mendelsohn writes, “Maurycy himself stands, in a colorful, exotic-looking [[Tallit|talith]], with head in hand. On the left we have the artist as a small boy, wearing a medallion with his initials written in Hebrew. On the extreme right is a young male figure, perhaps again Maurycy, reading from the prayer book alongside a man who might well be his father. Malinowski assumes that this is the case when he says that the painting presents ‘an account of [the artist's] whole life’.”

It has been suggested that the artist placed his fiancée Laura among the female worshippers, at the right of the column whispering to another woman (perhaps her mother), and to the left of the column, holding a [[Mahzor|prayerbook]] in hand. In the painting, many of the figures are people that are close to Gottlieb or people he knew at the time. As said by the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]], Maurycy Gottlieb created this work of art at the young age of 22 years old; a year later, Gottlieb would pass away. Most of the 20 figures depicted here represent people close to the artist.

==Themes and motifs==
There are many characteristics that create a somber tone within this painting. Author Jonathan Boyarin described motifs present in the image as “sadness, nostalgia, and beautification. There is no religious ecstasy, no intensity of emotion, only a pervasive melancholy.” The holiday of [[Yom Kippur]] is a solemn holiday when it is said that the Book of Life is sealed, and the fates of all those living are decided for the coming year. Certainly this aspect of the occasion would contribute to the sobriety of its depiction.

The somber character of the painting may also reflect the time in which it was painted. During the late 19th century, Jews in what is now [[History of the Jews in Ukraine#Russian Empire and Austrian rule|Ukraine]] were living under the auspices of the Russian Empire, in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Antisemitic discrimination was systemic and everpresent, and [[pogrom]]s and [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|expulsions]] occurred. Living under this regime in a time of deep antisemitic discrimination and political instability may have had a major impact on Gottlieb's work.

However, the painting may also evoke the anguish Gottlieb experienced in his personal life. Gottlieb may have suffered from depression, and in fact referenced his own suicide in the painting. The mantle of the Torah scroll is inscribed with a Hebrew dedication: “... donated in memory of ... R. Moshe [Maurycy’s [[Hebrew name]]] Gottlieb, the righteous of blessed memory.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur |url=http://www.tamuseum.org.il/en/collection-work/8224 |website=Tel Aviv Museum of Art |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the painting's completion, the aforementioned Laura married another man, breaking her engagement with Gottlieb. He became ill and died shortly thereafter; some believe as a result of physical ailment, but others suspect it was death by suicide due to deep depression.

'''KvinnSam - National Resource Library for Gender Studies''', formerly the Women’s History Collections, is the Swedish National Resource Library for Gender Studies. The collections belong to [[Gothenburg University Library]].
The library collects and organizes material on gender issues. This includes everything from academic theses to small leaflets and debate articles. The collections also comprise a manuscript collection with texts and photographs. Parts of these have been digitized and are now freely available on the Internet. A wide range of women’s journals, from the 19th century onwards, are also digitized.

KvinnSam produces four databases:
*KVINNSAM is the largest database on gender research in the Nordic countries. It contains more than 140,000 items&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/hitlist?d=libris&amp;q=db%3akvin+&amp;f=kvin&amp;spell=true&amp;hist=true&amp;p=1 The Database KVINNSAM]&lt;/ref&gt;
*GENA (GENusAvhandlingar) is a database of PhD-theses in Women's Studies, Men's Studies and Gender Research in Sweden, from 1960 onwards.
*GREDA (Gender Researchers Database) contains presentations of Swedish gender researchers.
*JÄMDA (Jämställdhetsdatabasen) is the newest database, launched in December 2009. It contains literature about gender mainstreaming and also about gender equality in a wider sense.
GENA, GREDA and JÄMDA have all been developed in collaboration with the Swedish National Secretariat for Gender Research.

The references in the databases are indexed with keywords chosen from a special list, in which the gender aspect is implicit. The keyword “journalists” implies female journalists, for male journalists you write “journalists: men”.

The '''Latin American Social Sciences Institute''' or '''Latin American School of Social Sciences''' ('''{{lang-es|Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales}}''' or '''FLACSO''') is an inter-governmental autonomous organization for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] dedicated to research, teaching and spreading of [[social science]]s.

It was created on April 17, 1957,&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; following a [[UNESCO]] initiative at the Latin American Conference on Social Sciences in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Its goal was to promote academic research and development in the region.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite news|first=Manuel|last=Avendaño |title=Josette Altmann, ex primera dama, electa Secretaria General de Flacso |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Josette-Altmann-secretaria-Flacso_0_1564643619.html |work=[[La Nación (San José)]] |date=2016-07-14 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its membership is open to Latin American and Caribbean countries that subscribe to the FLACSO agreement. Current members include: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Suriname]] and Uruguay.

[[Josette Altmann Borbón]], a historian and former [[First Lady of Costa Rica]], was elected Secretary General of FLACSO in June 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; She succeeded Manuel González on July 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt;

'''Logic''' (from the {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λογική|λογική]]|logikḗ}}&lt;ref name="argumentative"/&gt;), originally meaning "the word" or "what is spoken", but coming to mean "thought" or "reason", is a subject concerned with the most general laws of [[truth]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to Frege, see the [[Definitions of logic]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the [[Logical form|form]] of [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[inference]]. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its [[consequent|conclusion]]. (In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as ''therefore'', ''hence'', ''ergo'', and so on.)

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see {{section link||Rival conceptions}}, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of [[inference]], including [[fallacies]], and the study of [[semantics]], including [[paradox]]es.  Historically, logic has been studied in [[philosophy]] (since ancient times) and [[mathematics]] (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and other fields.

==Concepts==
{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], "First Rule of Logic"}}
The concept of [[logical form]] is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional [[syllogism|Aristotelian syllogistic logic]] and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.
* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[Logical argument|arguments]]. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See 'Rival conceptions', below.
* '''[[Mathematical formalism|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.&lt;ref name="The Basic Works"/&gt; In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.
* '''[[Mathematical logic#Symbolic logic|Symbolic logic]]''' is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].
* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[recursion theory]].

However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'".&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, [[Joseph Goguen|J. A. Goguen]], R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical form===
{{main article|Logical form}}
Logic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the [[universal quantifier]] ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".&lt;ref name="Aristotle's syllogistic from the standpoint of modern formal logic"/&gt; According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the "matter" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.

=== Semantics ===
{{main article|Semantics of logic}}

The validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.

Aristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[On Interpretation]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition Theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus "every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand." &lt;ref&gt;''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the [[Port Royal Logic]], says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, 1690.  [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], IV. v. 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.

Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".

===Inference===
''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.

===Logical systems===
{{main article|Formal system}}
A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:
* '''[[Consistency proof|Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, Merrie 2009"/&gt;
* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.
* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.
* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound  when it is both valid and its premises are true).&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

===Logic and rationality===
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}
As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.

There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],&lt;ref name=abduction&gt;On [[abductive reasoning]], see:
* Magnani, L. ''Abduction, Reason, and Science: Processes of Discovery and Explanation''. Kluwer Academic Plenum Publishers, New York, 2001. xvii. 205 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|0-306-46514-0}}.
* R. Josephson, J. &amp; G. Josephson, S. ''Abductive Inference: Computation, Philosophy, Technology''. Cambridge University Press, New York &amp; Cambridge (U.K.). viii. 306 pages. Hardcover (1994), {{isbn|0-521-43461-0}}, Paperback (1996), {{isbn|0-521-57545-1}}.
* Bunt, H. &amp; Black, W. ''Abduction, Belief and Context in Dialogue: Studies in Computational Pragmatics''. (Natural Language Processing, 1.) John Benjamins, Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2000. vi. 471 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|90-272-4983-0}}, {{ISBN|1556197942}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) first introduced the term as "guessing".&lt;ref name=guess&gt;See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:
* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.
* "PAP" ["Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319–320.
* A Letter to F. A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from an observed surprising circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to abduce &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; involves determining that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.

===Rival conceptions===
{{Main article|Rival conceptions of logic}}
Logic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic "does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations."&lt;ref name="stanford-logic-onthology"/&gt;

Logic has been defined{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as "the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form".  This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.&lt;ref name="brandom-2000" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{Main article|History of logic}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384–322&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]
In Europe, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mtu"/&gt; Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; as well as influential terms such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicables]], [[syllogisms]] and [[proposition]]s. In [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.

The [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325–250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two."&lt;ref name="propositions"/&gt; In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].

In India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number", as well as the theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].&lt;ref name="Indian logic: a reader"/&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.

The [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[Gödel]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.

The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and [[Wittgenstein]] had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.

===Syllogistic logic===
{{main article|Aristotelian logic}}
[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]

The ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.

Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.

Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.

{{Quotation|I was upset. I had always believed logic was a universal weapon, and now I realized how its validity depended on the way it was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Name of the Rose|last=Eco|first=Umberto|publisher=Vintage|year=1980|isbn=9780099466031|location=London|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Propositional logic===
{{main article|Propositional calculus}}
A propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as "theorems".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.

===Predicate logic===
[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that &lt;math&gt;\forall x. F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true.]]
{{main article|Predicate logic}}
Predicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], "there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves" can be formalised by the sentence &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{man}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{man}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;, using the non-logical predicate &lt;math&gt;\text{man}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation &lt;math&gt;\text{shaves}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].

Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.

The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytical philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].

Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Modal logic===
{{main article|Modal logic}}
In languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, "''We go to the games''" can be modified to give "''We should go to the games''", and "''We can go to the games''" and perhaps "''We will go to the games''". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].

===Informal reasoning and dialectic===
{{main article|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}
The motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].

This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809|date=1978|journal=Informal Logic|volume=1|issue=#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jacquette, Dale|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|publisher=Ontos Verlag|isbn=3110329050}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.

[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].

===Mathematical logic===
{{main article|Mathematical logic}}
Mathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

The earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle"/&gt; Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.&lt;ref name="Prior Analytics"/&gt;

One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s.

Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic5"/&gt; Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.

If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.

[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity"/&gt; Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6"/&gt;

===Philosophical logic===
{{main article|Philosophical logic}}
[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|("natural") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday&lt;!--was: "normal" proper--&gt; reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called "logic" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).

Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Epistemology and Cognition|first=Alvin I.|last=Goldman|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780674258969|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&amp;pg=PA293|quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development|volume=106|series=Advances in Psychology|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Demetriou|editor2-first=A.|editor2-last=Efklides|publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn=9780080867601|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&amp;pg=PA194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational logic===
{{main article|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]
Logic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt Gödel]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.

Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:
* Section F.3 on [[Logics and meanings of programs]] and F.4 on [[Mathematical logic and formal languages]] as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];
* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on [[Arithmetic and logic structures]], relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];
* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].

Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.

===Non-classical logic===
{{Main article|Non-classical logic}}
The logics discussed above are all "[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]" or "two-valued"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].

Hegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that "neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself".&lt;ref name="philosophical"/&gt;

In 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.&lt;ref name="Brenner2008"/&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, "possible", so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9781118053072|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of "degrees of truth", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].

[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.

==Controversies==
==="Is Logic Empirical?"===
{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}
What is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]"&lt;ref name="Is Logic Empirical?"/&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"/&gt;

Another paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.&lt;ref name="Truth and Other Enigmas"/&gt; Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, "Is Logic Empirical?" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].

===Implication: Strict or material===
{{main article|Paradoxes of material implication}}
The notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of "if&amp;nbsp;... then&amp;nbsp;...", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].

The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].

The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus "if that man gets elected, granny will die" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.

===Tolerating the impossible===
{{main article|Paraconsistent logic}}
[[Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.

Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.&lt;ref name="stanford7"/&gt;{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}

===Rejection of logical truth===
The philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a "...&amp;nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short&amp;nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="nietzsche"/&gt; His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that "logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished".&lt;ref name="nietzsche8"/&gt; Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: "Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world".&lt;ref name="nietzsche9"/&gt;

This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name="nietzsche10"/&gt; [[Georg Lukács]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, "Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with "He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|year=1945|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/|page=762|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|220px|thumb|right|"It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things."&lt;br/&gt;- [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], ''[[The Prince]]'']]

In [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], '''Machiavellian intelligence''' is the capacity of an entity to be in a successful [[political science|political]] engagement with [[social group]]s. The first introduction of this concept to [[primatology]] came from [[Frans de Waal]]'s book "Chimpanzee Politics" (1982), which described social maneuvering while explicitly quoting [[Machiavelli]]. Also known as '''machiavellianism''', it is the art of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] in which others are socially manipulated in a way that benefits the user.

==Machiavellian behaviors==
Machiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by [[behavior]]s including:
*[[blame|Blaming]] and [[forgiveness]];
*[[lie|Lying]] and [[truth|truth-telling]];
*Making and breaking [[Political alliance|alliances]];
*Making and breaking [[promise]]s;
*Making and breaking [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s;
*[[Misleading]] and misdirection.

==Criticisms==
===Food and nutrient factors===
The claim that large brains are linked to large social groups in [[primate]]s and [[cetacean]]s, on which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis is based, is criticized by a number of researchers for overlooking the availability of food as a common limiting factor for brain size and social group size. Among primates as well as cetaceans, there are some opportunistic species that eat most types of food and other species that are specialised in particular types of food, as well as differences in the overall availability of food between different geographical regions in which the animals live. Some critics of Machiavellian intelligence argue that species that have to keep their use of nutrients down due to food poverty or specialisation in a rare type of food lowers average brain size for species that live in smaller groups, making big brains falsely appear to be linked to large groups due to the common causes of opportunistic foraging for nutritious food and a rich supply of food. These critics also cite that the "exceptions" in the form of small-brained primates in very large groups typically eat abundant but nutrient-poor foods (such as [[gelada]]s that eat grass), as predicted by the food-based model, and argue that the higher individual need for nutrients put on by large brains causes groups to become smaller if the species have the same degree of digestive specialisation and environmental availability of food.&lt;ref&gt;Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not sociality - 2017, Alex R. DeCasien, Scott A. Williams &amp; James P. Higham https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0112 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evolution: Eating away at the social brain, Chris Venditti https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0122 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism that relates to food regards the assumption that modern [[hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] are living in marginal environments displaced by [[agriculture|farming peoples]] and that people in [[paleolithic]] times supposedly lived in larger social groups than hunters and gatherers do today. The researchers who put forward that criticism cite observations that hunters and gatherers often trade with farmers who live nearby and/or steal food from them, opportunities that were not available before agriculture was invented. The critics therefore argue that our prehistoric ancestors before agriculture lived in even smaller groups than hunters and gatherers do today, in groups smaller than those of the most opportunistic non-human apes as a result of the greater requirement for nutrients in human brains.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter-Gatherers: An Interdisciplinary Perspective - 2001 edition, Catherine Panter-Brick, Robert H. Layton, Peter Rowley-Conwy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barely Surviving or More than Enough?: The environmental archaeology of subsistence, specialisation and surplus food production - 2013, Maaike Groot, Daphne Lentjes, Jørn Zeiler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex social groups without intelligence===
Some researchers criticize the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis from observations of [[social insect]]s that form societies that are organized and yet have very small brains. Some of these insects, such as [[Jack jumper ant|Jack jumpers]] and [[paper wasp]]s have hierarchical societies in which each individual treat every other in accordance with their status, as opposed to the disorganized herds as which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis depict social animals with small brains.&lt;ref&gt;Ants at Work: How an Insect Society is Organized - 1999, Deborah M. Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insects, Science &amp; Society - 2012, David Pimentel&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term refers to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513) and to the hypothesis that the techniques which lead to certain kinds of political [[wikt:success|success]] within large [[social group]]s are also applicable within smaller groups, including the [[family|family-unit]]. The term "everyday politics" was later introduced in reference to these various methods. These arguments are based on research by primatologists such as [[Nicholas Humphrey]] (1975).

Anthropologist Robert Aunger explains that such an inclusive definition ends up encouraging poor anthropological practice because "it becomes difficult to distinguish what exactly is ''not'' part of culture".&lt;ref name=aunger&gt;{{cite book | title = The Electric Meme: A New Theory of How We Think | author = Robert Aunger | year = 2002 | publisher = The Free Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-7432-0150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aunger goes on to explain that after the [[cognitive revolution]] in the [[social sciences]] in the 1960s, there is "considerable agreement" among anthropologists that a mentifactual analysis, one that assumes that culture consists of "things in the head" (i.e. mentifacts) is the most appropriate way to define the concept of culture.&lt;ref name=aunger /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8226">The '''Military Writers Society of America''', also known as the '''MWSA''', is non-profit, 501(c)3 association of authors, poets, and artists, many of whom are U.S. military veterans or family members of veterans.  Membership is open to anyone with an interest in, affinity for, or connection to the military.

The organization provides a venue for meeting other authors and artists, sharing ideas and learning about writing and the publishing industry.  Its goals are: 
(a) to improve writing skills of its members, and
(b) to reach out to schools, military organizations and veterans’ groups to foster and encourage an interest in writing, and
(c) to recognize the accomplishments of its members' work in literature and the communication arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559a3339e4b059a64f95b0ae/t/59929c74d2b8572bae2c5cc5/1502780533165/MWSA_ByLaws.pdf|website=MWSA Bylaws|title=Bylaws of the Military Writers Society of America |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also reviews and considers for award books and other forms of art and literature each year.  Annual award winners are announced during an awards banquet, which is normally held during the organization's annual general membership conference.

The experience level and relative success of the membership varies widely, from relatively obscure, first-time writers to [[Bestseller|best-selling]] authors like [[Joe Buff]], [[Gayle Lynds]], [[Dale Dye]], and [[Joseph Badal]].

==History==
The Military Writers Society of America was the brainchild of its founder and first president,  [[W. H. (Rev. Bill) McDonald Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sbiands.org/rev-bill-mcdonald/&lt;/ref&gt;  A crew chief/door-gunner on UH-1D Huey helicopters in 1966 and 1967, Bill flew with the 128th Helicopter Assault Company  out of [[Phu Loi Base Camp|Phu Loi]], South Vietnam. He was awarded numerous medals, including: the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, fourteen Air Medals and the Purple Heart.

Like most who encounter the moral extremes of combat, Bill discovered that war is a crucible of spiritual transformation.  It is, quite simply, impossible to live through that sort of experience and not be changed by it.  To better understand his own experiences, Bill began to write about them. In the years since, he has discovered literally hundreds of other warriors who are driven to explore and reveal their experiences through fiction, non-fiction, poetry and art.   It was Bill's vision to bring them together to share and promote their respective arts. With more than 1200 members, the Military Writers Society of America is that vision brought to life.

The MWSA started off as branch of ''The American Authors Association'' (''AAA'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanauthorsassociation.com/&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming a fully separated organization of its own.  There are annual awards given for books, music Cds and short films.

The current President of MWSA is NY Times Best Selling Author Dwight Zimmerman.&lt;ref&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/author/dwightjonzimmerman/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Dwight_Jon_Zimmerman&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous president was Joyce Faulkner. She is a ghostwriter, an editor and a web, newspaper &amp; book designer. She has been a member of MWSA since 2006. Her goal is to help veterans record their piece of history—for themselves, their families, their communities—and our country, to make sure that all of our history is recorded and recognized. Her interest in military writing stems from her book ''In the Shadow of Suribachi'', the story of her father's experiences as a young Marine at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwsadispatches.com/leadership/ |title=MWSA Leadership |publisher=Military Writers |date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second president of the MWSA after the Founder McDonald stepped down for health reasons was Tony Lazzarini - a Vietnam combat veteran. After returning to the states, Tony worked for IBM as a service technician on communicating systems with their advanced products group. He left after 10 years to open his own high performance automotive shop. Along with racing and building cars, his other passions include writing and motorcycles. Tony started Voyager Publishing and his writing accomplishments include two award-winning books, a prize-winning musical stage play and two short films.

'''Mount Allison University''' (also '''Mount A''' or '''MtA''') is a primarily undergraduate [[Universities in Canada|Canadian]] liberal arts and science university located in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]].

Mount Allison University was the first university in the [[British Empire]] to award a baccalaureate to a woman ([[Grace Annie Lockhart]], B.Sc, 1875). Mount Allison graduates have been awarded a total of 55 [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sackvilletribunepost.com/news/local/katherine-reiss-named-mount-allison-universitys-55th-rhodes-scholar-263924/}}&lt;/ref&gt; American chemist [[James B.

Sumner - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/sumner-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Allison also has one of the largest endowments per student in Canada.

== History ==
Mount Allison University is a United Church-affiliated (but secular) primarily undergraduate liberal arts university, established at [[Sackville, New Brunswick]] on January 19, 1843. The university was named after Charles Frederick Allison, in honour of his gift of land and money.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins were steeped in the [[Methodist]] faith and it was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.&lt;ref name=University/&gt; The university was chartered on April 14, 1849.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"/&gt;

There is an amusing anecdote about the family of the founder of the school, [[Methodist]] merchant, [[Charles Frederick Allison]]. Charles Allison's grandfather had emigrated from [[Ireland]] to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession: silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, then they could certainly afford to pay more taxes. The Allisons left [[Ireland]] shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the university library.

In June 1839, Charles Allison was encouraged by Wesleyan Methodist Minister Rev. John Bass Strong that a school of elementary and higher learning be built. Allison offered to purchase a site in Sackville to erect a suitable building for an academy and to contribute operating funds of £100 a year for 10 years. This offer was accepted and the Wesleyan Academy for boys subsequently opened in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Reid, "ALLISON, CHARLES FREDERICK," in EN:UNDEF:public_citation_publication, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed January 27, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/allison_charles_frederick_8E.html.[https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Mansbridge.jpg|thumb|left|Previous Chancellor, [[Peter Mansbridge]]]]

In 1854, a girls' institution (later known as the "Ladies College") was opened to complement the boys' academy. In 1858 an Act of the New Brunswick Legislature authorized the trustees to establish a degree-conferring institution at Sackville, under the name of the Mount Allison Wesleyan College.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, by Various 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, the degree-granting [[Mount Allison College]] was organized. The first two students, [[Howard Sprague]] and [[Josiah Wood]], graduated in May 1863. Mount Allison was the first university in the [[British Empire]] to confer a bachelor's degree to a woman ([[Grace Annie Lockhart]], B.Sc. 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University. {{cite web |url=http://www.mta.ca/Prospective/About/Mount_A_essentials/History_and_facts/History_and_facts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132525/http://www.mta.ca/Prospective/About/Mount_A_essentials/History_and_facts/History_and_facts/ |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first university in Canada to grant a Bachelor of Arts to a woman(Harriet Starr Stewart).&lt;ref&gt;Semple, N. (1996). ''The Lord's Dominion: The History of Canadian Methodism.'' McGill-Queen's Press, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century, Mount Allison functioned as three distinct, mutually enriching parts: the College proper, the Boys' Academy, and the Ladies College. The corporate name was changed to University of Mount Allison College in 1886.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"/&gt;

The university's affiliation was transferred to the [[United Church of Canada]] following church union in 1925. Original components of the university included: the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy for Boys (1840–1958), the Ladies' College (1854–1958), and Mount Allison College. Mount Allison College was established in 1862 with degree-granting powers on behalf of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Music at Mount Allison University |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mount-allison-university-emc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SackvilleFoundersMonument.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Sackville founders monument commemorates [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]]'s incorporation and its founding peoples. It was installed on the campus of Mount Allison University in 2003.]]

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=University |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |first1=P. |last1=Anisef |first2=P. |last2=Axelrod |first3=J. |last3=Lennard |date=July 20, 2015 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/university/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, Mount Allison University had three faculties: Arts, Theology, and Engineering. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD), and [[Master of Arts]]. It had 246 male students and 73 female students, as well as 28 academic staff, all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy's Academy in 1953 coincided with a period of expansion and provided much-needed space for the growing university. In 1958, a period of construction and acquisition of buildings began, easing the strain of overcrowding at the institution. At this time the university board and administration decided to reaffirm the traditional aims of Mount Allison in providing a high-quality undergraduate [[liberal arts]] education, along with continuing to offer professional programs in already-established fields. As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate course development.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref name=University/&gt; Mount Allison University was established by the Mount Allison University Act, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.ca/governance/regents/MTA_act_1993.htm Mount Allison University Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230235004/http://mta.ca/governance/regents/MTA_act_1993.htm |date=2010-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Allison University's Arms and Badge were registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1201|title=Mount Allison University [Civil Institution]|first=The Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|website=archive.gg.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
The mission statement of Mount Allison University promotes "the creation and dissemination of knowledge in a community of higher learning, centred on the undergraduate student and delivered in an intimate and harmonious environment". Mount Allison currently offers bachelor's degrees in Arts, Science, Commerce, Fine Arts, and Music, as well as master's degrees in biology and chemistry and biochemistry, and certificates in bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/apply/|title=Mount Allison University - Steps to apply|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bachelor's degree in Science with a major in Aviation has been developed in conjunction with the [[Moncton Flight College]].

Mount Allison has one of the best records of [[Rhodes Scholars]] per capita in Canada — 55 all together, and 14 in the past 16 years.

In 2014, 76 per cent of the student body received an entrance scholarship.

The University's enrolment is approximately 2,300 students.

== Architecture ==

Mount Allison’s architecture is one of the campus’s defining features.

In most cases, the present campus is much newer than the age of the institution, which was founded in the mid-19th century. At that time, the original Mount Allison buildings were wooden clapboarded structures all painted white. Succumbing to fires or demolition, these earlier buildings have been replaced with brick or stone structures, although a unique and significant instance of early Mount Allison wooden architecture survives at the centre of campus: the President’s Cottage of 1857.

Noted architectural historian, John Leroux, who is working with visual artist Thaddeus Holownia on a book about the University’s architecture, calls the campus "one of the finest in Canada" &lt;ref name="mta.ca"&gt;The Record. {{cite web |url=http://www.mta.ca/therecord/fall15/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222161707/http://www.mta.ca/therecord/fall15/index.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and says some of the most beautiful buildings built in New Brunswick in the last 100 years are located at Mount Allison.

In particular, Leroux names the Mount Allison chapel as one of the most significant buildings in the province, saying, "It is exquisite. It is nearly a perfect building." &lt;ref name="mta.ca"/&gt; The Chapel is a masterwork of the Ontario-based architecture firm of Brown, Brisley and Brown, who designed numerous new buildings and transformed the site configuration of Mount Allison in the mid- to late-1960s and early 1970s into the landscape it is today. Paramount of their scheme was the creation of the central courtyard with the Chapel as a focus at one end, and the Library’s gateway colonnade overlooking the town and Convocation Hall at the other. Among the other Brown, Brisley and Brown buildings completed at Mount Allison between 1964 and 1980 are: the Gairdner Fine Arts building, the Marjorie Young Bell Conservatory of Music, the Barclay Chemistry Building, Edwards House, Thornton House, the Ralph Pickard Bell Library, and the Harold Crabtree building.

[[File:Owens Art Gallery, Mount A.jpg|thumb|right|Owens Art Gallery]] Other significant buildings are the Owens Art Gallery, the oldest University art gallery in Canada, which opened in 1895, and Hammond House, the only registered National Historic Site in the Town of Sackville. Both were designed by noted Toronto architect Edmund Burke. The Queen Anne Revival-style Hammond House was originally built for Canadian artist and head of the Fine Arts department John Hammond in 1896. It now serves as the President’s residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/Community/News/2013/August/National_Historic_Site_reopens_at_Mount_Allison/|title=Mount Allison University - National Historic Site reopens at Mount Allison|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several campus buildings were designed by architect Andrew R. Cobb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1618|title=Cobb, Andrew Randall - Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada|website=www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Memorial Library (1926–27; demol. 2011), Flemington Building (1930–31), and Centennial Hall (1883–84, but redesigned by Cobb in 1933 after the original was gutted by fire).

The Memorial Library (renamed University Centre in 1970) was constructed in the Tudor-inspired Gothic Revival style. The library also included a set of plaques, now located on the ground floor atrium of the Wallace McCain Student Centre, which are listed in the Canadian Forces' National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials – № 13002-004.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials|id=8237|title=Mount Allison University: Memorial 13002-004 Sackville, NB|access-date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaques list the names of Allisonians who lost their lives at war. Every year since 1927, the names of each of the fallen are read aloud during the University’s annual Remembrance Day service.

The Wallace McCain Student Centre, originally constructed as a men’s residence (Trueman House) in 1945 and designed by Halifax architect C.A. Fowler, was gutted and repurposed in 2008, keeping the exterior form and stone walls intact.

The newest building on campus is the Purdy Crawford Centre for the Arts, which opened in 2014. Housing the Department of Fine Arts and the drama program, the building features art studios, a large atrium, and the 100-seat Motyer-Fancy Theatre. Designed by the internationally honoured Canadian architecture firm Zeidler Partnership, it was featured in Canadian Architect magazine in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Architect. https://www.canadianarchitect.com/features/making-a-scene/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing ==
[[File:Cambellhallroom1.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the single rooms at Campbell Hall]]

Mount Allison has housing facilities available for approximately 50 percent of its student population. More than 85 percent of first-year students choose to live in residence. On-campus accommodations are guaranteed to all first-year students who meet admission and deposit deadlines. All rooms come with high speed wired as well as wireless Internet, as well as cable, phone, and mini fridge.

All buildings are co-ed with wing to wing or integrated bathrooms. Sixty percent of rooms are either single or ensuite style and 40 percent are double accommodation. Campbell Hall, winner of CBIP Award for incorporation of environment features, offers large single rooms with ensuite bathrooms. In addition, Mount Allison also offers senior students a chance to live in one of two small residences (Carriage – six rooms, Anchorage – 11 rooms.)

The following residences are open for new and returning students:
* Campbell Hall
* Harper Hall
* Windsor Hall
* Bigelow House
* Bennett House
* Hunton House
* Thornton House
* Edwards House

== Social life ==

Social life at Mount Allison tends to focus on extracurricular activities: 140 clubs and societies and over 30 varsity, club, and intramural sports teams.&lt;ref name="aucc.ca"/&gt;

Mount Allison students also socialize at places like Gracie's, The Pond (campus pub), Ducky's, Joey's, and the Bridge Street Café.

Mount Allison's campus paper, ''The Argosy'', is an independent publication produced weekly. The publication dates from 1872,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argosy.ca/about-argosy ]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the oldest student publications in the country. The campus and community radio station, [[CHMA-FM|CHMA]] 106.9 FM, is owned and operated by the members of Attic Broadcasting Company Ltd., a non-profit organization with its offices on the university campus.

[[File:MTAConvocationHall.jpg|thumb|220px|Springtime in Sackville – a view of Convocation Hall from the swan pond, Mount Allison University.]]

[[Tintamarre theatre company]] was founded at Mount Allison by Professor Alex Fancy and produces a bilingual collective show each year, staged at the Motyer-Fancy Theatre and later presented at junior and senior high schools throughout the Maritime provinces. A performing arts series is held at Convocation Hall (one of the largest concert halls east of Montreal) during the school year, and the annual President's Speakers Series &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/pss|title=Mount Allison University - President's Speakers Series|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings nationally and internationally renowned speakers to campus each year.

Fine Art students run START Gallery within Struts Gallery, a CARFAC artist-run center.

== Student government ==

The Mount Allison Students’ Union (MASU) represents all full- and part-time students at Mount Allison. It operates as a membership-based non-profit corporation, and was incorporated in 1980 under the New Brunswick Companies Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masu.ca/who/about|title=About the MASU|website=masu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Mount Allison Mounties}}

The school's team name in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS) is the [[Mount Allison Mounties]]. The football team has appeared in the [[Vanier Cup]] national college football championship game twice (1984 &amp; 1991). The Mount Allison football team also made playoff appearances in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The team won the 2013 AUS championship, but lost to the Laval Rouge et Or in the [[Uteck Bowl]] (the national college football semi final) and in 2014, losing to McMaster in the Mitchell Bowl.

Mount Allison is also home to a CIS-level women's hockey team, as well as swim, badminton, and soccer teams. Basketball and volleyball teams compete against colleges and other smaller universities.

Mount Allison is the winner of the first ever [[Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association|ACAA]] men's rugby championship in 2007 and remained undefeated through 2010, resulting in four consecutive championships.&lt;ref name="ACAA Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acaa.ca/page.php?page=43&amp;menu=9&amp;gen=m&amp;sport=rugby |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164131/http://www.acaa.ca/page.php?page=43&amp;menu=9&amp;gen=m&amp;sport=rugby |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both 2008 and 2009 the men's and women's Mounties remained undefeated throughout the regular season and became ACAA champions.&lt;ref name="ACAA Homepage"/&gt; The university women's hockey team plays at the [[Tantramar Civic Centre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7251">'''Multimedia Studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of academic discourse focused on the understanding of technologies and cultural dimensions of linking traditional media sources with ones based on new media to support social systems.

==History==
Multimedia Studies as a discipline came out of the need for media studies to be made relevant to the new world of CD-ROMs and [[hypertext]] in the 1990s. Revolutionary books like Jakob Nielsen's 'Hypertext and Hypermedia' book lay the foundations for understanding multimedia alongside traditional cognitive science and interface design issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. (1990). Hypertext and Hypermedia. Saunders College Publishing/Harcourt Brace. {{ISBN|0125184107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software like [[Adobe Authorware|Authorware Attain]], now owned by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], made the design of multimedia systems accessible to those unskilled in programming and became major applications by the end of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Schifman, R.S. (1999). The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3540641238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Challenges===
The Internet age that has been growing since the launch of [[Windows 98]] has brought new challenges for the discipline including developing new models and rules for the World Wide Web. Areas such as usability have had to develop specific guidelines for Website design&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. &amp; Tahir, M. (2001). Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed. {{ISBN|073571102X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional concepts like genre, narrative theory, and stereotypes have had to be updated to take account of Cyberculture.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S.C., Scheidt, L.A. ;  Bonus, S. ;  Wright, E. (2004). Bridging the gap: a genre analysis of Weblogs. In: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.M. (2001). Unsolicited Narratives from the Internet: A Rich Source of Qualitative Data. Qual Health Res 11 (5), 706-714&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural aspects of Multimedia Studies have been conceptualised by authors such as [[Lev Manovich]],&lt;ref name="Manovich 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev |authorlink= Lev Manovich |editor= Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Nick Montfort |title= The New Media Reader |format= PDF |accessdate= 6 May 2007 |year= 2003 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |pages= 13–25 |chapter= New Media from Borges to HTML |chapterurl= http://mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210054445/http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |archivedate= 10 December 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manovich 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev | authorlink= Lev Manovich |title= The Language of a New Media |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-63255-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Fred Forest]].&lt;ref name="Macek 2005"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Forest, Fred| title = Pour un art actuel, l'art à l'heure d'Internet | date = | url = http://www.fredforest.org/artactuel/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolling]] and so-called [[Internet addiction]] has thrown up new problems. Concepts like emotional design &lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A. (2005). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and affective computing &lt;ref&gt;Picard, R. (2000). Affective Computing. MIT Press. {{ISBN|0262661152}}&lt;/ref&gt; are driving Multimedia Studies research to consider ways of becoming more seductive and able to take account of the different needs of users.

====Media Studies 2.0====
Some academics, such as [[David Gauntlett]], have preferred the neologism, 'Media Studies 2.0' to Multimedia Studies, in order to give it the feel of other fields like [[Web 2.0]] and Classroom 2.0.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;British Film Institute, [http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ Media Studies Conference 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107113722/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ |date=2007-11-07 }}, 4–6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;[http://www.transformingaudiences.org.uk Transforming Audiences International Conference], 6–7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2"&gt;Andy Ruddock (2008), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00040.x 'Media Studies 2.0? Binge Drinking and Why Audiences Still Matter'], ''Sociology Compass'', Volume 2 Issue 1 Page 1-15, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;[http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt 'Towards a Brave New World? The Media Studies 2.0 Debate'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003185242/http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt |date=2011-10-03 }}, presentation by Geoff Lealand, University of Waikato, at AMES conference, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;[http://twopointzeroforum.blogspot.com/ Blog/forum about Media Studies 2.0] by William Merrin&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Media Studies 2.0 neologism has received strong criticism. Andy Medhurst at Sussex University for instance wrote of the Media Studies 2.0 neologism introduced by David Gauntlett, 'Isn't it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?'

'''The Oriental Institute in Sarajevo''' ({{lang-bs|Orijentalni institut u Sarajevu / Оријентални институт у Сарајеву}}) is an academic institute in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded in 1950 by the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is part of the [[University of Sarajevo]]. but it suffered significant destruction in 1992 during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]].

==1992 shelling==
Its premises, research library and complete manuscript collection (more than 2,000 codices and 15,000 other archival material) were deliberately destroyed in shelling on May 18, 1992 by Serb forces around the [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged city of Sarajevo]]. According to interviews with eyewitnesses, the building had been hit with a barrage of incendiary munitions, fired from positions on the hills overlooking the town center. No other buildings in the densely built neighborhood were hit. The Institute, which occupied the top floors of a large, four-storey office block on the corner of Veljka Cubrilovica Street and Marshal Tito Boulevard ([[Centar Municipality, Sarajevo|Sarajevo Centar]] municipality), was completely burned out, its collections destroyed. 

The manuscript collection of the Oriental institute was one of the richest collections of Oriental manuscripts worldwide. These manuscripts over centuries were written in the wide areas of the East to serve worldwide as life manuals for the people. 

Losses also included 5,263 bound manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and local ''[[arebica]]'' - ''(Bosnian in Arabic script)'', as well as tens of thousands of Ottoman-era documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51052">'''Philosophy, politics and economics''' ('''PPE''') is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[undergraduate]]/[[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] [[academic degree|degree]] which combines study from three disciplines.

The first institution to offer degrees in PPE was the [[University of Oxford]] in the 1920s. This particular course has produced a [[List of University of Oxford people with PPE degrees|significant number of notable graduates]] such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese politician, State Counsellor of Myanmar, Nobel Peace Prize winner; [[Christopher Hitchens]], the British–American author, [[polemic]]ist, [[debate]]r, and journalist;&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho1"&gt;'Hitchens, Christopher Eric', ''Who's Who''; 2012, A &amp; C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2012 ; online edn, January 2012 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U20283, accessed 5 December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsvq4PYdt40&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23m55s|title=Christopher Hitchens - On C-SPAN discussing his book 'For the Sake of Argument' [1993]|publisher=C-SPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippa Foot]] a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Harold Wilson]], [[Edward Heath]] and [[David Cameron]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]; [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and [[Ed Miliband]], former [[Leader of the Opposition|Leaders of the Opposition]]; [[William Hague]], the former Leader of the Opposition and former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Benazir Bhutto]],  [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Imran Khan]], and [[Malcolm Fraser]], [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Tony Abbott]], former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenny|first=Mark|title=Tony Abbott's Oxford transcript released|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbotts-oxford-transcript-released-20131125-2y6a1.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain |title=PPE: the Oxford degree that runs Britain |last=Beckett |first=Andy|author-link=Andy Beckett|date=23 February 2017|website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course received fresh attention in 2017, when Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Malala Yousafzai]] earned a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=A level results: Malala Yousafzai gets a place at Oxford|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-40959543|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Malala Yousafzai gets into Oxford to study PPE after collecting A Level results|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/08/17/malala-yousafzai-gets-oxford-study-ppe/|accessdate=18 August 2017|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the [[University of York]] went on to establish its own PPE degree based upon the Oxford model; [[King's College London]], the [[University of Warwick]], the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], and other British universities later followed.  According to the [[BBC]], the Oxford PPE "dominate[s] public life" (in the UK).&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11136511 |title=Why does PPE rule Britain? | last1=Kelly | first1=Jon |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now offered at several other leading colleges and universities around the world.

== History ==
Philosophy, Politics and Economics was established as a degree course at the University of Oxford in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp#_Toc146507694] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830181845/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp|date=2009-08-30}} "Balliol was the birthplace of the modern degree of PPE in the 1920s. A. D. Lindsay, who subsequently became the master of the college, played a key role in the establishment of the degree and Balliol has long remained a major college for the study of PPE, and PPE has long been a major subject within Balliol."&lt;/ref&gt; as a modern alternative to [[classics]] (known as "[[literae humaniores]]" or "greats" at Oxford) because it was thought as a more modern alternative for those entering the [[civil service]]. It was thus initially known as "modern greats".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/the_faculty/history_of_philosophy |title=History of Philosophy at Oxford – Faculty of Philosophy |publisher=Philosophy.ox.ac.uk |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PPE students commenced their course in the autumn of 1921.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; The regulation by which it was established is Statt. Tit. VI. Sect. 1 C; "the subject of the Honour School of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics shall be the study of the structure, and the philosophical and economic principles, of Modern Society."&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford (1926) ''The Examination Statutes. together with the regulations of the boards of studies and boards of faculties for the academical year 1926-1927''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 149=54&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was compulsory to study all three subjects for all three years of the course, but in 1970 this requirement was relaxed, and since then students have been able to drop one subject after the first year – most do this, but a minority continue with all three.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

During the 1960s some students started to critique the course from a left-wing perspective, culminating in the publication of a pamphlet, ''The Poverty of PPE'', in 1968, written by Trevor Pateman, who argued that it "gives no training in scholarship, only refining to a high degree of perfection the ability to write short dilettantish essays on the basis of very little knowledge: ideal training for the social engineer". The pamphlet advocated incorporating the study of sociology, anthropology and art, and to take on the aim of "assist(ing) the radicalisation and mobilisation of political opinion outside the university". In response, some minor changes were made, with influential leftist writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Régis Debray]] being added to politics reading lists, but the core of the programme remained the same.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

Christopher Stray has pointed to the course as one reason for the gradual decline of the study of classics, as classicists in political life began to be edged out by those who had studied the modern greats.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stray, ''Classics Transformed: Schools, Universities, and Society in England, 1830–1960''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998. Pp. xiv, 336. {{ISBN|0-19-815013-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk have described the course as being fundamental to the development of political thought in the UK, since it established a connection between politics and philosophy. Previously at Oxford, and for some time subsequently at Cambridge, politics had been taught only as a branch of modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk, ''The History of Political Thought in National Context''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-78234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course material ==
The programme is rooted in the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks. In this regard, the study of [[philosophy]] is considered important because it both equips students with [[meta-tools]] such as the ability to [[reason]] rigorously and [[logic]]ally, and facilitates [[ethical]] reflection. The study of [[politics]] is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the institutions that govern society and help solve [[collective action]] problems. Finally, studying [[economics]] is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events. The vast majority of students at Oxford drop one of the three subjects for the second and third years of their course. Oxford now has more than 600 undergraduates studying the subject, admitting over 200 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|title=Why Study PPE at Oxford?|work=ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic opinions ==
Oxford PPE graduate [[Nick Cohen]] and former tutor Iain McLean consider the course's breadth important to its appeal, especially "because British society values generalists over specialists". Academic and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]] noted that "PPE combines the status of an elite university degree – PPE is the ultimate form of being good at school – with the stamp of a vocational course. It is perfect training for cabinet membership, and it gives you a view of life". However he also noted that it had an orientation towards consensus politics and [[technocracy]].&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

[[Geoff Evans (political scientist)|Geoffrey Evans]], an Oxford fellow in politics and a senior tutor, critiques that the Oxford course's success and consequent over-demand is a self-perpetuating feature of those in front of and behind the scenes in national administration, in stating "all in all, it's how the class system works". In the current economic system he bemoans the unavoidable inequalities besetting admissions and thereby enviable recruitment prospects of successful graduates. The argument itself intended as a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] ethical reflection on how governments and peoples can perpetuate [[social stratification]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

[[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]], a former adviser to [[Ed Miliband]] who studied PPE at Oxford in the 1980s and taught politics there in the 1990s and 2000s, acknowledged that the programme has been slow to catch up with contemporary political developments, saying that "it does still feel like a course for people who are going to run the Raj in 1936... In the politics part of PPE, you can go three years without discussing a single contemporary public policy issue". He also stated that the structure of the course gave it a [[centrist]] bias, due to the range of material covered: "...most students think, mistakenly, that the only way to do it justice is to take a centre position".&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

'''Promession''' is an idea of how to dispose [[Disposal of human corpses|human remains]] by way of [[freeze drying]]. The concept of promession was developed by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[biologist]] Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, who derived the name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "promise" (''promessa'').&lt;ref name=holst&gt;{{cite news|last=Holst|first=Karen|title=Swedish green-burial firm to turn frozen corpses in compost|url=http://www.thelocal.se/33178/20110413/|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She founded [[Promessa Organic]]&amp;nbsp;[[Aktiebolag|AB]] in 1997 to commercially pursue her idea.&lt;ref name=undertaker&gt;{{cite news|last=McNally|first=Patrick|title=Promession: A Return to the Living Soil|url=http://www.dailyundertaker.com/2008/09/promession-return-to-living-soil.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Undertaker|date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was liquidated 2015 without being able to produce a functioning facility. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/orust/promessa-slutligen-i-konkurs-1.925619|title=Promessa slutligen i konkurs|work=Bohusläningen|access-date=2018-09-12|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of promession is questioned and not a functional method according to critics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=3818201|title=Ekologisk begravning - Studio Ett|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Promession involves five steps:
# [[Coffin]] separation: the body is placed into the chamber
# Cryogenic freezing: [[liquid nitrogen]] at −196 [[°C]] crystallizes the body
# Vibration: the body is disintegrated into particles within minutes
# Freeze drying: particles are freeze dried in a drying chamber, leaving approximately 30% of the original weight
# Metal separation: any metals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;tooth [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[Hip replacement|artificial hip]]s, etc.) are removed, either by magnetism or by sieving. The dry powder is placed in a [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] [[casket]] which is interred in the top [[Soil horizon|layers of soil]], where aerobic bacteria decompose the remains into [[humus]] in as little as 6–12 months.

'''''Questions of Truth''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] and Nicholas Beale which offers their responses to 51 questions about science and religion. The foreword is contributed by [[Antony Hewish]].

The book was launched at a workshop at the 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Annual Meeting in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml AAAS Annual Meeting 2009 Workshop Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304021809/http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml |date=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the UK at a discussion at the [[Royal Society]] chaired by [[Onora O'Neill]], in a week when it was also featured on the [[Today Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7918000/7918145.stm Interview with] [[John Polkinghorne]] by [[John Humphrys]] [[BBC]] [[Today Programme]] 2-Mar-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key themes and ideas==
[[File:AAAS Launch workshop1 m.JPG|thumb|upright|Launch at 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Annual Conference with President [[James J. McCarthy]] (standing) and authors]]
The book grew out of questions generated at a website organized to communicate Polkinghorne's ideas. It groups selected questions under seven topics:&lt;ref name="PWorld"&gt;[http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ One Scientist's Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415035123/http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ |date=April 15, 2009 }} review in ''[[Physics World]]'' April-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Leading Questions'' gives an overview of Polkinghorne's views on nine questions, including science and religion, the existence of God, and atheism.
# ''The Concept and Existence of God'' begins with "Can God's existence be proved?" and addresses ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[omniscience]], [[predestination]] and [[the Trinity]].
# ''The Universe'' considers the [[Big Bang]], the [[Anthropic Principle]] and a [[Theory of Everything]].
# ''Evolution'' starts with "Is evolution a fact or a theory?", discusses [[Intelligent Design]], which is deemed an unfortunate use of language and a theological mistake, and explores whether the mind can be explained by evolution.
# ''Evil'' suggests that "The evil that is not the result of human sin seems to be the result of the workings out of the natural laws of physics and biology" and considers the [[Devil]], cancer and [[Original Sin]].
# ''Human Being'' suggests that [[Adam and Eve]] refer to the first spiritually conscious human beings, that the [[soul]] is something ''logically'' distinct from the body but not a separate physical entity, and that [[conscience]] is "our deepest understanding of right and wrong".
# ''Religion'' begins with "Is atheism a form of faith?", suggests that "For each part of the Bible you have to ask what kind of writing it is and what God is trying to tell us through it", and considers the [[Resurrection]] and that "God will not force us to accept his love ... [but] will save everyone he can - no-one will be excluded because God did not want them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthquestion.com|title=Truth theory|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|date=|website=|publisher=Indian Times|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each question is followed by the responses of Beale and Polkinghorne, sometimes as a single answer and sometimes by the two authors individually. Its three appendixes constitute a third of the book:&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;
* ''Anthropic Fine-Tuning'' draws on [[Martin Rees]]'s book ''Just Six Numbers'' to illustrate the point that if the fundamental constants of physics were slightly different then no intelligent life could exist in the Universe. It then considers [[Multiverse]] ideas and especially [[Lee Smolin]]'s [[Cosmological natural selection]], which, it suggests, has problems from physics and evolutionary dynamics. It also discusses notions of complexity and improbability.
* ''Brain and Consciousness'' suggests that "pretty much everything in the universe has a physical aspect and an informational aspect, neither of which is more foundational than the other", and that informational entities like the [[Mass in B Minor]] cannot be considered as material objects. It proposes that "your body and your mind are different aspects of you", and that the inherent uncertainties of neuron firing mean that the brain is not fully deterministic.
* ''Evolution'' begins by pointing out that since [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] Christians have not taken the Genesis creation accounts "literally", and that key developers of the current theory (e.g. [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Simon Conway-Morris]] and [[Martin Nowak]]) have been Christians, suggesting that there is no conflict between Christianity and evolution, that small genetic changes can have big effects, that [[genetic determinism]] is mistaken, and that there are evolutionary benefits to religion.

==Reviews==

[[Julian Baggini]], writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', said that Polkinghorne has no problems reconciling his faith with his science and suggests that "despite the complexity of some of the scientific issues discussed", the book "is a commendably clear read".  He says "it is a pity that the people most likely to buy this book are those simply seeking intellectual reassurance that their faith is not irrational.  Those who would most benefit from reading it are in fact fundamentalists who think that evolutionary science must be wrong, and overconfident atheists who believe that the religious are manifestly irrational.” &lt;ref name = "FT"&gt;[[Julian Baggini]] "A Twist of Faith: How to reconcile religious belief with science" ''Financial Times'' Life and Arts, p.16, 21 Feb.,'09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]]'s [http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=708#comments additional comments on his talkingphilosophy site and the subsequent discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]] wrote a highly critical review in the ''[[New Humanist]]''. He states that the responses to questions concerning science and religion boil down to three strategies, [[God of the gaps]], [[inference to the best explanation]], and religion and science explain truths in [[non-overlapping magisteria|different domains]]. He considers the first two refutable by undergraduates, and for the third strategy to work, he contends that one has to "cherry-pick which bits of scripture and dogma are to be taken as symbolic and which as literally true" in order to conveniently avoid the possibility of direct and testable confrontation with science. He concludes the review by expressing his outrage at the [[Royal Society]]'s decision to allow its premises to be used for the launch of the book, as in his opinion this amounts to having "the superstitious lucubrations of illiterate goatherds living several thousand years ago given the same credibility as contemporary scientific research."&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;A. C. Grayling: [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1998 Book Review: Questions of Truth]. ''New Humanist'' 124 (2), March/April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Physics World]]'' commends the authors for handling the diverse readership, skeptics and believers, in a "remarkably even-handed way", but laments that concerns with specifics of Christian doctrine may limit the book's appeal; however, scientifically minded readers may find the extensive appendices a good starting point. The reviewer concludes that the book provides valuable insight for those interested in the science and religion debate.&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;

In addition, some periodicals have included brief reviews. &lt;!-- These are all less than a paragraph on the book. --&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, "Many readers will welcome this accessible format, but some may find the blurring of science and theology confusing."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6612221.html?industryid=47159 Publishers Weekly Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Library Journal]]'' described it as intriguing and a thought-provoking work, and said that [[John Polkinghorne]] was a “a kind of antidote to [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] for the intellectual theist or Christian."&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 Library Journal Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305095840/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Episcopal Life'' says the book offers "some interesting conclusions".&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life 3-Mar-09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312123834/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Sample, reflecting over his interview with Polkinghorne for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that there was much in the book that he found offensive, especially the idea that God needs to remain [[divine hiddenness|hidden]] from his creation lest they be completely overwhelmed, a notion Sample describes as "a bit patronising".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web | work=The Guardian | last=Sample | first=Ian | accessdate=19 January 2010 | date=9 April 2009 | title=Can science be used to prove the existence of God? | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/apr/09/religion-controversiesinscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''revivalist artist''' or '''revivalist band''' is a musical group, singer, or musician dedicated to reviving interest in a musical genre from an earlier era.

Such performers are usually dedicated enthusiasts of a particular musical genre – often a style that is no longer in vogue – and act as evangelists to spread awareness and appreciation of that music to new audiences. Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.

Unlike [[tribute act]]s who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]]) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.

Unlike [[cover band]]s who are primarily populist entertainers playing [[cover versions]] of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era.  Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.

Most revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre.  Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.

[[image:Palazzo medici riccardi, bugnato 01.JPG|thumb|Two different styles of rustication in the [[Palazzo Medici-Riccardi]] in [[Florence]]; smooth-faced above and rough-faced below.]]
[[File:Château de Fontainebleau 2011 (200).JPG|thumb|Extreme [[Mannerist]] "cyclopian" rustication at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]]]

In [[classical architecture]]  '''rustication''' is a range of [[masonry]] techniques giving visible surfaces a finish that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished, squared-block masonry surfaces called [[ashlar]].  The visible face of each individual block is cut back around the edges to make its size and placing very clear.  In addition the central part of the face of each block may be given a deliberately rough or patterned surface.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 45-47, 58-59, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusticated masonry is usually "dressed", or squared off neatly, on all sides of the stones except the face that will be visible when the stone is put in place.  This is given wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block, by angling the edges ("channel-jointed"), or dropping them back a little.  The main part of the exposed face may be worked flat and smooth or left with, or worked, to give a more or less rough or patterned surface.  Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above. Though intended to convey a "rustic" simplicity, the finish is highly artificial, and the faces of the stones often carefully worked to achieve an appearance of a coarse finish.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustication was used in ancient times, but became especially popular in the revived classical styles of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and that of subsequent periods, above all in the lower floors of secular buildings. It remains in use in some modern architecture.

Similar finishes are very common in medieval architecture, especially in [[castle]]s, walls and similar buildings, but here it merely arises from an unwillingness to spend the extra money required for ashlar masonry in a particular building, and lacks the deliberate emphasis on the joints between blocks. Though it often achieves a decorative effect, this is something of a by-product, and the exploitation for architectural effect within a single building of contrasts between rusticated and ashlar surfaces is rarely seen.  In some buildings, such as the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] (begun 1298) something other than cost-saving is at play, and this may be the association of the technique with the display of power and strength, from its use in military architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;  Rough finishes on stone are also very common in architecture outside the European tradition, but these too would generally not be called rustication. For example, the bases of [[Japanese castle]]s and other fortifications usually use rough stone, often very attractively.

==History==
[[File:Serlio XXIX.jpg|thumb|left|Serlio, rusticated doorway of the type now called a [[Gibbs surround]], 1537]]
Although rustication is known from a few buildings of Greek and Roman antiquity, for example Rome's [[Porta Maggiore]], the method first became popular during the [[Renaissance]], when the stone work of lower floors and sometimes entire [[facade]]s of buildings were finished in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 58; Woodman. There is much detail in Alfonso Acocella, [http://www.architetturadipietra.it/wp/?p=4952 "Greek and Roman rustication"], online re-edit of his section in ''Stone architecture. Ancient and modern constructive skills'', Milan, Skira-Lucense, 2006, pp. 624 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was generally used for secular buildings, and has always remained uncommon in churches, perhaps through a lingering association with the architecture of military power; there are exceptions, such as [[St Giles in the Fields]], London (1730–34).

Probably the earliest and most influential example is the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in [[Florence]], built between 1444 and 1484, with two contrasting rusticated finishes.  The ground floor has an irregular and  genuinely rugged appearance, with a variation in the degree to which parts of the faces of blocks project from the wall that is rarely equalled later.  Above, the rustication is merely to emphasize the individual blocks, and the faces are all smooth and even.  Also in Florence, [[Palazzo Strozzi]], begun 1489, with large oblong rounded cushions, and the front of the [[Pitti Palace]], begun 1458, rusticated their whole facades in the same style.  These facades only used the [[classical order]]s in [[mullion]]s and [[aedicule]]s, with arched forms in rustication the main relief from the massive flat walls.  The [[Palazzo Rucellai]], probably of the 1460s, begins to classicize such facades, using smooth-faced rustication throughout, except for the pilasters at each level.

In Rome, [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Palazzo Caprini]] ("House of Raphael", by 1510, now destroyed) provided a standard model for the integration of rustication with the orders.  Here the obvious strength of a blind arched [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] with emphatic [[voussoir]]s on the rusticated ground storey (in fact using stucco) gave reassuring support to the upper storey's paired [[Doric order|Doric]] columns standing on rusticated [[pier (architecture)|piers]], set against a smooth wall.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major Renaissance building in Spain, the [[Palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] (1527), had a deeply rusticated ground floor facade with regular rounded cushions.

The technique was enthusiatically taken up by the next generation of [[Mannerist]] architects, with [[Giulio Romano]] in the lead.  Most early examples of this "rustic" style are therefore built for sophisticated patrons in the leading centres of taste.  Giulio's [[Palazzo Stati Maccarani]] in Rome and [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] expand the voussoirs still further, and the courtyard in Mantua plays games with the technique, with some blocks ashlar, other projecting further than the rest, and larger blocks placed higher than smaller ones.  The Mannerist architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and others of his generation enjoyed the play between rusticated and finished architectural elements. In the woodcut of a doorway from Serlio's 1537 treatise, the banded rustication of the wall is carried right across the attached column and the moldings of the doorway surround, binding together all the elements. 
[[File:Somerset House courtyard (06).JPG|thumb|Courtyard of [[Somerset House]] in London, mostly smooth-faced "V" joints, but with vermiculated square blocks around the [[Gibbs surround]] to the door.]]

The Italians brought in to expand the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] introduced the technique to France.  Its spread to Germany and England took longer, but by about the end of the 16th century it had reached all parts of Europe.  In his [[Banqueting House]] in London (1619), [[Inigo Jones]] gave a lightly rusticated surface texture to emphasize the blocks on both storeys, and to unify them behind his orders of pilasters and columns. 
 
During the 18th century, following the [[Palladian]] revival, rustication was widely used on the ground floors of large buildings, as its contrived appearance of simplicity and solidity contrasted well to the carved ornamental stonework and columns of the floors above: "Rustication became almost obligatory in all 18th- and 19th-century public buildings in Europe and the USA".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman, exaggerating somewhat&lt;/ref&gt;  A ground floor with rustication, especially in an English mansion such as [[Kedleston Hall]], is sometimes referred to as the "rustic floor", in order to distinguish it from the [[piano nobile]] above.  As well as uses emphasizing the horizontal, rustication is often used in relatively narrow vertical bands, on the [[quoin]]s at corners or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Rustication may also be confined to the surrounds of arches, doors or windows, especially at the top.  In these and other situations where rustication stops horizontally, the edge is usually made up of vertically alternating long and short blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Rustication therefore often reverses the patterns of medieval and later [[vernacular architecture]], where roughly dressed wall surfaces often contrast with ashlar quoins and frames to openings.
[[File:Castle Howard, june 2011.JPG|thumb|left|Regular smooth-faced rustication (left) turns to horizontal banded rustication at the corner of [[Castle Howard]] in North Yorkshire, England.]]

Architectural books by authors such as [[James Gibbs]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] set out detailed recommendations for the proportions of the blocks in relation to columns in the same facade, and the proportion of the block that a widened joint should occupy, though their prescriptions differ, and were not always followed by architects.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, rustication after 1700 is highly regular, with the front faces of blocks flat even when worked in patterns, as opposed to the real unevenness often seen in the 16th-century examples.  Often the Palazzo Medici Riccardi model is followed; the ground floor has heavy rustication with textured faces, while above there is smooth-faced "V" rustication.  Though such horizontal zones of rustication are the most common, vertical zones can often be used as highlights, as in the illustration from Catania above, or the Cour Napoleon in the [[Louvre Palace]].  The Baroque garden front of the [[Pitti Palace]] achieves a striking effect, not often copied, by using extensive "blocking", both rounded and rectangular, on the shafts of its columns and pilasters.

[[Canton Viaduct]], a blind arcade cavity wall railroad viaduct built in 1834-35 in [[Canton, Massachusetts]] is an example of modest effects of rustication in industrial architecture; the effect is pleasing, and the cost was probably reduced. Massive effects of contrasting rustications typify the "[[Richardsonian Romanesque]]" style exemplified in the 1870s and 80s by the American architect [[H. H. Richardson]].  The technique is still sometimes used in architecture of a broadly [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] character, especially in city centre streets where it helps modern buildings blend with older ones with rustication.

Although essentially a technique for stone masonry, rustication can be imitated in brick and [[stucco]],&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt; which began as early as [[Bramante]]'s [[Palazzo Caprini]] and was common in smaller houses in [[Georgian architecture]], and also in wood (see below), which is mainly found in [[British America]].

==Variations==
[[File:Vermiculures.JPG|thumb|Two adjacent vermiculated blocks showing rather different interpretations of the pattern.]]

The most common variation of rustication is the smooth-faced, where the external face of the block is smooth, as in ashlar, and differs from that only by the cutting in at the joints; this became increasingly popular, and is now the most commonly seen type.  If deeply cut-back edges are worked only to the horizontal joints, with the appearance of the vertical joints being minimised, the resulting effect is known as '''banded rustication''', mostly seen on the lowest levels of very large buildings like the [[Palace of Versailles]] or the main [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] building in London.  As at Versailles, the bands may de "elbowed", dipping diagonally around arches to join up with and emphasize the [[voussoir]]s.  Banded rustication is mostly seen with smooth-faced stones, and has remained popular in [[Stripped Classicism]] and other contemporary versions of classical styles.  In this style, the bands are sometimes several feet apart, making it apparent that stone facings are being used.

When the stone is left with a rough external surface, rough shapes may be drilled or chiselled in the somewhat smoothed face in a technique called "vermiculation" ('''vermiculate rustication''' or '''vermicular rustication'''), so called from the Latin ''vermiculus'' meaning "little worm",&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt; because the shapes resemble worms, worm-casts or worm tracks in mud or wet sand.  Carved vermiculation requires a good deal of careful mason's work, and is mostly used over limited areas to highlight them. Disparities between individual blocks are often seen, presumably as different carvers interpreted their patterns slightly differently, or had different levels of skill.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The small Turner Mausoleum at [[Kirkleatham]] by [[James Gibbs]] (1740) has an unusually large area vermiculated, over half of the main level.  When the shapes join up to form a network, the style is called "reticulated".&lt;ref&gt;McKay, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, especially from the Baroque onwards, the roughly flattened central areas of stones are indented in regular, but not too regular, patterns called "pecked" or "picked-work", and various other ways of patterning them may be found.  In garden architecture, where water was to flow over or near the surface, a vertically oriented pattern evoking hanging pond-weed or [[algae]], or [[icicle]]s ("frost-work") is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/styles/classical/features/rustication.html Looking at buildings], "Rustication"&lt;/ref&gt;  Also associated with gardens is "cyclopian" rustication, where the blocks are very large and irregular, as though placed by giants, and "rock-work", where surfaces are built up of rough rocks not placed in regular courses at all.  This last goes beyond rustication, and is found in fountains and follies, and later [[rockery|rockeries]] for planting.

In '''prismatic rustication''' the blocks are dressed at an angle near each edge, giving a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]-like shape.&lt;ref&gt;"Prismatic", in Curl, James Stevens, ''Encyclopaedia of Architectural Terms'', 1993, Donhead Publishing, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the faces rise to a single point, this is often known by terms using "diamond", and is covered below. They may also, usually in blocks that are oblong rather than square, rise to a ridge in the centre.  Both types are illustrated, with several others, by Serlio.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, fig. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diamond rustication===
[[Image:Catane Université.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sicilian Baroque]] [[pilaster]]s with two types of prismatic rustication against a smooth background at the [[University of Catania]]]]
Various types of other patterns in masonry surfaces are sometimes called rustication. These include "diamond point" or "diamond rustication" where the face of each stone is a low [[pyramid]] facing out.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;  This covered the whole facade of the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] in [[Ferrara]], completed in 1503, and most of that of the [[Palace of Facets]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], designed by Italians and completed in 1492, with rectangular "diamonds". These "diamond palaces" influenced other whole walls of diamonds at [[Casa dos Bicos]] in Portugal (after 1523, alternate stones only), and [[Crichton Castle]] in Scotland (c. 1585; all stones, with flat edges between pyramids).

The round towers at the [[Castello Sforzesco]] in [[Milan]] almost use diamonds, but their points are smoothed over. The illustration at right, from [[Catania]] in Sicily, alternates rows of three square "diamond" blocks with two oblong blocks, where the faces rise to a ridge rather than a point, showing both the main forms of "prismatic rustication".

The sharply pointed styles have really nothing to do with classical rustication, and are instead a development of styles of raised decoration of masonry that were popular in late [[Gothic architecture]], especially the Iberian [[Manueline]] (or Portuguese late Gothic) and its equivalent in Spain, known as [[Isabelline Gothic]]. When not figurative these are known as [[bossage]].  These are probably a development of [[Mudéjar]] styles of patterning walls.  In the spectacular late 15th-century gateway to the [[Palacio de Jabalquinto]] in [[Baeza]], [[Andalucia]], small widely spaced pyramids cover one of the many zones with fancy carved elements, projecting from a wall otherwise in ashlar.

Later, in [[Baroque architecture]], relatively small areas of diamond rustication were reintegrated into architecture in the classical tradition, and were popular as highlights, especially in [[Sicily]] and southern Italy and Eastern and [[Central Europe]].  The large [[Černín Palace]] in [[Prague]] (1660s) repeats the Kremlin formula of a broad zone of diamonds across the middle height of the facade, though like the towers in Milan these do not come to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feigned rustication==
[[File:MountVernon-Rustication.JPG|thumb|Simple smooth-faced rustication in wood at [[Mount Vernon]]; an imitation of European style popular in America]] 
The appearance of rustication, creating a rough, unfinished stone-like surface, can be worked on a wooden exterior.  This process became popular in 18th century New England to translate the features of [[Palladian architecture]] to the house-carpenter's idiom: in Virginia [[Monticello]] and [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]] both made use of this technique.  Mount Vernon in particular makes extensive use of feigned rustication and sanded paint and the original finished surfaces of several original planks still survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/visit/plan/index.cfm/pid/541/ |title=George Washington's Mount Vernon - Rustication |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work=Mount Vernon |publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229065757/http://www.mountvernon.org/visit/plan/index.cfm/pid/541/ |archivedate=2008-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustication of a wooden exterior consists of three basic steps.  First, the wood is cut, sanded and prepared with [[bevel]]ed grooves that make each plank appear as if it were a series of stone blocks.  Second, the wood is painted with a thick coat of paint.  Third, while the paint is still wet, sand is thrown or air blasted onto the planks until no more sand will stick.  After the paint dries the plank is ready for use.

In [[Central Europe]], especially the [[Czech Republic]], feigned rustication in [[sgraffito]] (decoration by scraping away one colour of coating on an exterior to show another beneath) is a feature from the Late Renaissance onwards, continuing into the 20th century.  Often "prismatic" or "diamond" rustication is imitated.

'''Scale analysis''' (or '''order-of-magnitude analysis''') is a powerful tool used in the [[mathematical sciences]] for the simplification of [[equation]]s with many terms. First the approximate magnitude of individual terms in the equations is determined. Then some negligibly small terms may be ignored.

==Example: vertical momentum in synoptic-scale meteorology==

Consider for example the [[Primitive equations|momentum equation]] of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in the vertical coordinate direction of the atmosphere

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} + u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} + v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} + w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} - {\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}}= - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} - g +2{\Omega u \cos \varphi} + \nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2}}\right),\qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is [[Earth]] radius, &amp;Omega; is [[frequency]] of rotation of the Earth, ''g'' is [[gravitational acceleration]], &amp;phi; is  latitude, &amp;rho; is [[density]] of air and &amp;nu; is [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] of air (we can neglect turbulence in [[free atmosphere]]).

In [[synoptic scale]] we can expect horizontal velocities about ''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and vertical about ''W'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Horizontal scale is ''L'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and vertical scale is ''H'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.  Typical time scale is ''T'' = ''L''/''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s.  Pressure differences in troposphere  are ''ΔP'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa and density of air &amp;rho; = 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Other physical properties are approximately:

:''R'' = 6.378 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m;

:&amp;Omega; = 7.292 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; rad&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:&amp;nu; = 1.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:''g'' = 9.81 m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2.&lt;/sup&gt;

Estimates of the different terms in equation (1) can be made using their scales:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} &amp;\sim \frac{W}{T} \\[1.2ex]
u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} &amp;\sim W\frac{W}{H} \\[1.2ex]
{\frac{u^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} &amp;\qquad
{\frac{v^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} \\[1.2ex]
\frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} &amp;\sim \frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\Delta P}{H} &amp;\qquad
\Omega u \cos \varphi &amp;\sim \Omega U \\[1.2ex]
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{H^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can introduce these scales and their values into equation (1):

:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^5}}+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10^{-2}{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^4}}
-{\frac{10^2+10^2}{10^6}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between lines of "displayed" TeX, for legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
= - {{\frac{1}{1}} {\frac{10^4}{10^4}} } - 10 + 2 \times 10^{-4} \times 10 + 10^{-5} \left({\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{8}}}  \right).
\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that all terms — except the first and second on the right-hand side — are negligibly small. Thus we can simplify the vertical momentum equation to the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{ { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} = - g. \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

==Rules of scale analysis==
Scale analysis is very useful and widely used tool for solving problems in the area of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, pressure-driven wall jet, separating flows behind backward-facing steps, jet diffusion flames, study of linear and non-linear dynamics. Scale analysis is recommended as the premier method for obtaining the most information per unit of intellectual effort, despite the fact that it is a precondition for good analysis in dimensionless form. The object of scale analysis is to use the basic principles of convective heat transfer to produce order-of-magnitude estimates for the quantities of interest. Scale analysis anticipates within a factor of order one when done properly, the expensive results produced by exact analyses. Scale analysis ruled as follows:

'''Rule1-''' First step in scale analysis is to define the domain of extent in which we apply scale analysis. Any scale analysis of a flow region that is not uniquely defined is not valid.

'''Rule2-''' One equation constitutes an equivalence between the scales of two dominant terms appearing in the equation. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho c_P {{\partial T }\over{\partial t }} = k {\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, the left-hand side could be of equal order of magnitude as the right-hand side.

'''Rule3-''' If in the sum of two terms given by

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of one term is greater than order of magnitude of the other term

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) &gt; O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the order of magnitude of the sum is dictated by the dominant term

:&lt;math&gt; O(c) = O(a)  &lt;/math&gt;

The same conclusion holds if we have the difference of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; c = a-b &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule4-''' In the sum of two terms, if two terms are same order of magnitude,

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) = O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the sum is also of same order of magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) \thicksim O(b) \thicksim O(c)  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule5-''' In case of product of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; p=ab &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of the product is equal to the product of the orders of magnitude of the two factors

:&lt;math&gt; O(p) = O(a)O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

for ratios

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{a}{b}  &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; O(r) = \frac{O(a)}{O(b)}  &lt;/math&gt;

here O(a) represents the order of magnitude of a.

~ represents two terms are of same order of magnitude.

&gt; represents greater than, in the sense of order-of-magnitude.

[[File:Fully developed flow.png|thumb|Developing flow in the entrance region of a parallel-plates duct]]

==Scale analysis of fully developed flow==

Consider the steady laminar flow of a viscous fluid inside a circular tube. Let the fluid enter with a uniform velocity over the flow across section. As the fluid moves down the tube a boundary layer of low-velocity fluid forms and grows on the surface because the fluid immediately adjacent to the surface have zero velocity. A particular and simplifying feature of viscous flow inside cylindrical tubes is the fact that the boundary layer must meet itself at the tube centerline, and the velocity distribution then establishes a fixed pattern that is invariant. Hydrodynamic entrance length is that part of the tube in which the momentum boundary layer grows and the velocity distribution changes with length. The fixed velocity distribution in the fully developed region is called fully developed velocity profile.
The steady-state continuity and conservation of momentum equations in two-dimensional are

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}}=0 , \qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(2)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial v }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(3)  &lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be simplified by using scale analysis. At any point &lt;math&gt;x\sim L &lt;/math&gt; in fully developed zone, we have &lt;math&gt;y\sim\delta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u\sim U_\infty &lt;/math&gt;. Now, from equation(1), 
the transverse velocity component in fully developed region simplified using scaling as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v &amp;\sim {\frac{U_{\infty} \delta}{L}}  \qquad(4) 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;
In fully developed region the section of the duct flow far from inlet such that scale of transverse velocity component v is negligible(L&gt;&gt;d).So, in fully developed flow limit, 
continuity equation requires

:&lt;math&gt;v=0,  {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }}=0  \qquad(5)  &lt;/math&gt;

Based on equation(5), the y momentum equation eq3 reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial P }\over{\partial y }}=0  \qquad(6)  &lt;/math&gt;

this means that P is function of x only. From this, the x momentum equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;{{d P }\over{d x }}=\mu {{d^2 u}\over{d y^2 }}=constant \qquad(7)  &lt;/math&gt;

Each term should be constant, because left side is function of x only and right is function of y. Solving equation(7) subject to the boundary condition

:&lt;math&gt; u=0, y=\pm \frac{D}{2}  \qquad(8) &lt;/math&gt;

this results in the well-known Hagen–Poiseuille solution for fully developed flow between parallel plates.

:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{3}{2}U[1-{(\frac{y}{D/2})}^2]  \qquad(9) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U=\frac{D^2}{12\mu}(-\frac{dP}{dx})  \qquad(10) &lt;/math&gt;

where y is measured away from the center of the channel. The velocity is to be parabolic and is proportional to the pressure per unit duct length in the direction of the flow.

The '''Second Industrial Revolution''', also known as the '''Technological Revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muntone|first=Stephanie|title=Second Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|work=Education.com|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224325/http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The [[First Industrial Revolution]], which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in [[manufacturing]], such as the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, the development of methods for manufacturing [[interchangeable parts]] and the invention of the [[Bessemer Process]] to produce [[steel]], the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the start of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistoryscene.com/article/second-industrial-revolution/ The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870-1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] and [[railroad]] networks, gas and [[water supply]], and [[sewage systems]], which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of [[globalization]]. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly [[electrical power]] and [[telephone]]s. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory [[electrification]] and the [[production line]], and ended at the start of [[World War I]].

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], but also in [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. It followed on from the [[First Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. It was characterized by the build out of [[railroad]]s, large-scale iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], use of [[petroleum]] and the beginning of [[electrification]].  It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by [[Patrick Geddes]], ''[[Patrick Geddes#Published works|Cities in Evolution]]'' (1910), but [[David Landes]]' use of the term in a 1966 essay and in ''[[The Unbound Prometheus]]'' (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] (1918–2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use.&lt;ref&gt;James Hull, "The Second Industrial Revolution: The History of a Concept", ''Storia Della Storiografia,'' 1999, Issue 36, pp 81–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Landes (2003) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially, the [[internal combustion engine]] and petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], electricity and communication technologies (such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and [[radio]]).

Vaclav Smil called the period 1867–1914 "The Age of [[Synergy]]" during which most of the great innovations were developed since the inventions and innovations were engineering and [[Applied science|science-based]].&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil  |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-516874-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.  Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads.  Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives.  This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron ===
The [[hot blast]] technique, in which the hot [[flue gas]] from a blast furnace is used to [[air preheater|preheat]] combustion air blown into a [[blast furnace]], was invented and patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828 at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first=David.  S.|authorlink=David Landes|year=1969|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-09418-6|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling costs for producing [[wrought iron]] coincided with the emergence of the [[railway]] in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. [[Edward Alfred Cowper]] developed the Cowper stove in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=256–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Steel ===
[[File:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Bessemer converter]]. Air blown through holes in the converter bottom creates a violent reaction in the molten pig iron that oxidizes the excess carbon, converting the pig iron to pure iron or steel, depending on the residual carbon.]]

The [[Bessemer process]], invented by [[Sir Henry Bessemer]], allowed the [[mass-production]] of [[steel]], increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from [[pig iron]] by [[oxidation]] with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The "acid" Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce [[hematite]] ore&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is low in phosphorus. [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the [[phosphorus]] from [[iron]]. Collaborating with his cousin, [[Percy Gilchrist]] a chemist at the [[Blaenavon Ironworks]], [[Wales]], he patented his process in 1878;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-GIL-1850.html ''Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist'' at Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolckow Vaughan]] &amp; Co. in [[Yorkshire]] was the first company to use his patented process.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist |volume=26 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom/&gt;

[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] operated 18 Bessemer converters and owned the largest steelworks in the world at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The next great advance in steel making was the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer [[Pierre-Émile Martin]] was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens-Martin process complemented rather than replaced the [[Bessemer process]].  Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, [[skyscraper]]s, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were [[steel cable]], steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s and naval ships.

=== Rail ===
[[File:The rail rolling mill, Hughesovka.jpg|thumb|300px|A rail rolling mill in [[Donetsk]], 1887.]]
The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that [[railroad]]s could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. [[Wrought iron]] was soft and contained flaws caused by included [[dross]].  Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and was damaged by [[hammer blow]]. The first to make durable [[rail profile|rails]] of steel rather than [[wrought iron]] was [[Robert Forester Mushet]] at the [[Darkhill Ironworks]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1857.

The first of his steel rails was sent to [[Derby Midland railway station]].  They were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolt |first1=L.T.C |title=Victorian Engineering |year=1974 |origyear= |publisher=Pelican |location=London |isbn=  |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of [[railways|rail transportation]] throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.

This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first=Nathan|authorlink=|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-27367-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grubler|first1=Arnulf|author1-link=|title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures|year=1990|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrification ===
{{Main|Electrification|Electricity}}
The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist [[Michael Faraday]]. Through his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]], Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Faraday, Michael |volume=10 |page=173 |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004417/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.

[[File:Light bulb Edison 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|U.S. Patent#223898: Electric-Lamp. Issued January 27, 1880.]]

In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the first feasible [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', October 3, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRE&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', December 29, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the first electrical street lighting installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|title=Sir Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=home.frognet.net|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005841/http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Chemsoc/Activities/ChemicalLandmarks/UK/JosephSwan.asp |title=Sir Joseph Swan, The Literary &amp; Philosophical Society of Newcastle |date=3 February 2009 |publisher=rsc.org |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home.

The first modern power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]] at [[Deptford]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) [[alternating current]], it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage [[AC power]] that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. [[Electrification]] allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the [[assembly line]] and [[mass production]].&lt;ref name ="Ford1922"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Henry|author1-link=Henry Ford|author2=Crowther, Samuel |title=My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford|year=1922|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]] was called "the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives |last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2988 }} (Viewable on line)&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric [[tram|street railways]] were either using his equipment or in planning.  The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920.  The AC ([[Induction motor]]) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the [[electrification#History of electrification|electrification]] of industry.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink=  |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= |pages=14, 15 |url= |location= Cambridge, MA; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. [[Fluorescent light]]ing was commercially introduced at the [[1939 World's Fair]].

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of [[Electrochemistry#19th century|electro-chemicals]], such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine tools ===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|A graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts.]]

The use of [[machine tool]]s began with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution|First Industrial Revolution]]. The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in [[James Watt]]'s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to [[Henry Maudslay]] and refined by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became the world's first national machine tool standard called [[British Standard Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9–10.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of [[machine tools]] to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last=Ford |first=Henry |authorlink= |author2=Crowther, Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |isbn= |pages=30 |url= |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper making ===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The first paper making machine was the [[Fourdrinier machine]], built by Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers in [[London]]. In 1800, [[Matthias Koops]], working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000'', Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}. pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1840s,  that [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in [[Saxony]] both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper. This started a new era for [[History of paper|paper making]],&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the invention of the [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The [[petroleum industry#History|petroleum industry]], both production and [[Petroleum refinery|refining]], began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] set up a small business refining the crude oil in 1848. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | authorlink = | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 Young built the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world at [[Bathgate]], using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

[[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|Cable tool drilling]] was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells.  The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine.  Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first "modern oil well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC&amp;pg=PA13 M.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil.  Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the [[gas mantle]]. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. [[Gasoline]] was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the [[Burton process]] for [[cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.&lt;ref name = Yergin/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1881]]
[[Synthetic dye]] was discovered by English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin's accidental discovery was that [[aniline]] could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new "[[mauveine]]", and commercialized it as the world's first synthetic dye.&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.
Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The launch of [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], which was advanced for her time, 1843.|alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags]]
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]] was introduced in 1835 by [[Francis Pettit Smith]] who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |title=History and Design of Propellers: Part 1 |publisher=the boatbuilding.community |accessdate=2007-09-03 |date=2004-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811200813/http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith's [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and the paddle steamer {{HMS|Alecto|1839|6}}; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by [[Horseley Ironworks]] and named the ''[[Aaron Manby]]''. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]''&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan (2006), pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref name="Beckett 2006, pp. 171–173"&gt;Beckett (2006), pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumpleton and Miller (2002), pp. 34–46&lt;/ref&gt; built by engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[keel]] and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H (2003). ''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''. [[Oxford University Press]] (US). {{ISBN|978-0-19-516731-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel's vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion steam engines]] began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt; [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|The oscillating engine]] was first built by [[Aaron Manby (ironmaster)|Aaron Manby]] and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term ''oscillating''.

It was [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]], engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the [[grasshopper beam engine]]. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the [[Admiralty]] yacht, {{HMS|Black Eagle}} with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay, Son &amp; Field]]. Penn also introduced the [[marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. {{HMS|Encounter|1846|6}} (1846) and {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}} (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.&lt;ref&gt;Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103–116 &amp; Preston, A., &amp; Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern [[battleship]]s in the 1870s, evolved from the [[ironclad]] design of the 1860s. The [[Devastation-class ironclad|''Devastation''-class]] [[turret ship]]s were built for the British [[Royal Navy]] as the first class of ocean-going [[capital ship]] that did not carry [[sail]]s, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The [[vulcanization]] of [[rubber]], by American [[Charles Goodyear]] and Englishman [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of [[Tyres|rubber tyre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245 |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling - William Hume, 1938.

&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop's development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]] and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer [[Harry John Lawson]] in 1876, although it was [[John Kemp Starley]] who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1880-1939/IC.025/|title=Icons of Invention: Rover safety bicycle, 1885|publisher=The Science Museum.|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity soon grew, causing the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the [[Macadam]] method pioneered by Scottish engineer [[John Loudon McAdam]], and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile===
German inventor [[Karl Benz]] patented the world's [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|first automobile]] in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition &lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

[[Henry Ford]] built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford's vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with [[machine tools]] and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the [[assembly line]], the complete process being called [[mass production]]. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year.&lt;ref name ="Ford1922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; The savings from [[mass production]] methods allowed the price of the [[Model T]] to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied science===
[[Applied science]] opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of [[thermodynamics]] and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of [[physical chemistry]]. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of [[metallurgy]] was advanced through the work of [[Henry Clifton Sorby]] and others. Sorby pioneered the study of [[iron]] and [[steel]] under [[microscope]], which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Henry Clifton Sorby|url=http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211758/http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for [[Henry Bessemer]] and [[Robert Forester Mushet]] to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[nickel]] which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. [[Vanadium steel]], for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (2006) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s.  Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery.  Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the "father of the fertilizer industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] which produced the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] [[meat extract]]. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], introduced modern conventions for [[molecular modeling]] and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of [[thermodynamics]] was developed into its modern form by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]]. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and [[steam turbine]]s. The work of [[Michael Faraday]] and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of [[electricity]].

Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was particularly influential—his discoveries ushered in the era of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Knots_and_physics.html |title=Topology and Scottish mathematical physics |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that described [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] as manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]], namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]] and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell himself developed the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270–283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr | title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424–444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control theory is the basis for [[process control]], which is widely used in [[automation]], particularly for [[process industries]], and for controlling ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800–1930 |last=Benett|first= Stuart|authorlink=|year=1986|publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology
|location=|isbn= 978-0-86341-047-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Control theory]] was developed to analyze the functioning of [[centrifugal governor]]s on steam engines.  These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by [[James Watt]].  Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders.  However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory.  The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
[[Justus von Liebig]] was the first to understand the importance of [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]], and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to [[plant nutrition]]. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating [[phosphate of lime]] in bone meal with [[sulfuric acid]]. Another pioneer was [[John Bennet Lawes]] who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet |volume=16 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Coprolite#Coprolite mining|coprolites]] in commercial quantities in [[East Anglia]], led Fisons and [[Edward Packard (businessman, born 1819)|Edward Packard]] to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at [[Bramford]], and [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in the 1850s. By the 1870s [[superphosphate]]s produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html History of Fisons at Yara.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50172&amp;back=|title=Oxford DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] along with his business partner [[Sam Eyde]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Aaron John Ihde|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon replaced by the much more efficient [[Haber process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950|author1=Trevor Illtyd Williams|author2=Thomas Kingston Derry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0198581599|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by the [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemists [[Carl Bosch]] of [[IG Farben]] and [[Fritz Haber]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/haberbosch.html Haber &amp; Bosch ''Most influential persons of the 20th century''], by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;/ref&gt; The process utilized molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of [[nitric acid]].

===Engines and turbines===
The [[steam turbine]] was developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] in 1884. His first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152751/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized [[Turbinia|marine transport and naval warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used [[internal combustion engine]] was the [[Otto engine|Otto type]] of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt; The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today's common gasoline engine.

The [[diesel engine]] was independently designed by [[Rudolf Diesel]] and [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world's most efficient prime mover.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

===Telecommunications===
[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|thumb|400px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]
The first commercial [[telegraph]] system was installed by Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] in May 1837 between [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EKr7FUkw?url=http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first [[undersea cable]] being built by [[John Watkins Brett]] between [[France]] and [[England]].
The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. This was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85573-301-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref name="kennedy197110"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=563928| title=Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870-1914 | author=Kennedy, P.

The [[telephone]] was patented in 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John, ''Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications''  (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory]]. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. [[David Edward Hughes]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

It was Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amit|last=Roy|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/nation/story_10221833.jsp|work=The Telegraph|location=[[Kolkota]]|title=Cambridge 'pioneer' honour for Bose|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year transmitted [[Morse code]] across [[Salisbury Plain]], sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea&lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070120163444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]] to [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key development of the [[vacuum tube]] by Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. [[Lee De Forest]]'s subsequent invention of the [[triode]] allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern [[business enterprise]] by scholars such as Alfred Chandler.  Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement.  Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough.  A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather.    A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform.  This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority.  When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines  along the railroads to keep track of trains.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous.  Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs.  For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight.  They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time.  This led to what was called "railroad accounting", which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last= Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred |date= 1993 |title= The Visible Hand|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 115 |isbn= 0674417682 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAI3AwAAQBAJ | access-date = 2017-06-29 | quote = [...] American railroad accounting overstated operating costs and understated capital consumption.[...] The basic innovations in financial and capital accounting appeared in the 1850s in response to specific needs and were perfected in the years after the Civil War.

&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and others in America developed the concept of [[scientific management]] or [[Taylorism]]. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as [[time and motion study|time-and-motion studies]], but the concepts evolved into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], and [[business management]] that helped to completely restructure{{cn|date=June 2017}} the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor's core principles included:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task"
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==
The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)|productivity]].  This caused [[unemployment]] and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from [[public health]] initiatives, such as the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies—(the [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power.  Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ayres|last2=Warr|first1=Robert U.|first2 = Benjamin|author1-link =|title=Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work|year=2004|url=http://www.iea.org/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in steam efficiency, like [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade.  Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the [[Jevons paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships.  This, plus the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods.  This led to many business failures and periods that were called ''depressions'' that occurred as the world economy actually grew.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;  See also: [[Long depression]]

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the [[Low Countries]]) in the 1830s and '40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% percent and the vast majority of the British population was [[urbanization|urbanized]]. This milestone was reached by the [[Low Countries]] and the US in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Grigg|title=Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline|journal=|jstor=40572192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in [[free trade]] throughout this period.  The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 149, based on Paul Bairoch, "International Industrialization Levels from 1750 to 1980," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1982) v. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life.  They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII.  Only a few major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, [[combustion turbine]]s (jet engines) and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives|last=Constable|first=George|authorlink=|author2=Somerville, Bob|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08908-5|pages=|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/id=2988}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}This link is to entire on line book.&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with [[mass production]] techniques (after 1910) greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &amp;mdash; and falling &amp;mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vatter | last2 = Walker| last3 =Alperovitz| first1 = Harold G.| first2 = John F.| first3 =Gar| author1-link =| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910–1990, Journal of Economic Issues| date = June 1995| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5437/is_n2_v29/ai_n28658086/| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century.  The [[Gilded Age]] in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and [[coal mining]].  The iconic event was the opening of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation's financial market in [[Wall Street]]. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry&amp;mdash;a few large corporations, some organized as "trusts" (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the [[Bessemer process]]. The first billion-dollar corporation was [[United States Steel]], formed by financier [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others.&lt;ref name="Edward C. Kirkland 1961"&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860–1897'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hovey Calhoun, ''The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflicts'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment distribution ===
In the early 1900s there was a disparity between the levels of employment seen in the northern and southern United States. On average, states in the North had both a higher population, and a higher rate of employment than states in the South. The higher rate of employment is easily seen by considering the 1909 rates of employment compared to the populations of each state in the 1910 census. This difference was most notable in the states with the largest populations, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Each of these states had roughly 5 percent more of the total US workforce than would be expected given their populations. Conversely, the states in the South with the best actual rates of employment, North Carolina and Georgia, had roughly 2 percent less of the workforce than one would expect from their population. When the averages of all southern states and all northern states are taken, the trend holds with the North over-performing by about 2 percent, and the South under-performing by about 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steuart, William M. Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914 .. Washington: Govt. Print. Off., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Empire]] came to rival Britain as Europe's primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German [[Concern (business)|concern]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.  Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry and O'Rourke (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]]. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.  The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrochemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies "the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1990) p 474-5&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many spin offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Burhop, "Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck," ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] during the [[Belle Époque]] showed the value of the [[History of rail transport|railways]] for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it [[Belgian Revolution|broke away from the Netherlands]] and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. [[History of rail transport in Belgium|The system]] was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative uses==
There have been other times that have been called "second industrial revolution". Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of [[medieval technology]] in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the [[Tang Dynasty]], or of [[ancient Roman technology]], as first. "Second industrial revolution" has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after [[World War I]].

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the [[Atomic Age]] were more intense and lasting than those over the [[Space age]] but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the [[21st century]]&lt;ref&gt;google.com&lt;/ref&gt; the term "second industrial revolution" has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today's modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13437">'''Sensitivity auditing''' is an extension of [[sensitivity analysis]] for use in policy-relevant modelling studies. Its use is recommended - e.g. in the European Commission Impact assessment guidelines &lt;ref name=IA /&gt; - when a [[sensitivity analysis]] (SA) of a model-based study is meant to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence provided by the model, but in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Latinorum"&gt;Saltelli, A., van der Sluijs, J., Guimarães Pereira, Â., 2013, Funtowiz, S.O., What do I make of your Latinorum? Sensitivity auditing of mathematical modelling, International Journal Foresight and Innovation Policy, 9 (2/3/4), 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
In these cases, the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become highly relevant, and a pure SA - with its focus on parametric (i.e. quantified) uncertainty - may be insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may, among other things, derive from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about `what the problem is' and foremost about `who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).

In order to take these concerns into due consideration, sensitivity auditing extends the instruments of [[sensitivity analysis]] to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge- and model-generating process. It takes inspiration from [[NUSAP]],&lt;ref name="NUSAP"&gt;Van der Sluijs JP, Craye M, Funtowicz S, Kloprogge P, Ravetz J, Risbey J (2005) Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system. Risk Analysis 25(2):481-492&lt;/ref&gt; a method used to qualify the worth (quality) of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences.&lt;ref name="Latinorum" /&gt; Sensitivity auditing is especially suitable in an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to the evidence, is the subject of partisan interests. These are the settings considered in [[Post-normal science]] &lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1993. Science for the post-normal age. Futures, 25(7), 739–755.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Mode 2]]&lt;ref name="Gibbons1993"&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges; Helga Nowotny; Simon Schwartzman; Peter Scott; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage. {{ISBN|0-8039-7794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; science. [[Post-normal science]] (PNS) is a concept developed by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]],&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1991"&gt;Funtowicz, S.O. and Jerome R. Ravetz (1991). "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues." In Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability. Ed. Robert Costanza. New York: Columbia University Press: 137–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1992. Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science. In S. Krimsky &amp; D. Golding (Eds.), Social theories of risk (pp. 251–273). Westport, CT: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate when “facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent” (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1992:&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992" /&gt; 251–273). [[Mode 2]] Science, coined in 1994 by Gibbons et al., refers to a mode of production of scientific knowledge that is context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. Carrozza (2015)&lt;ref name="Carrozza2015"&gt;Carrozza, C., 2015. “Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis”, Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a discussion of these concepts and approaches.

Sensitivity auditing is recommended by the [[European Commission]] for use in [[impact assessment]]s in order to improve the quality of model-based evidence used to support policy decisions.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;European Commission. (2015). Guidelines on Impact Assessment - European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/tool_56_en.htm European Commission Better Regulation Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rules==
Sensitivity auditing is summarised by seven rules or guiding principles:
# Check against the rhetorical use of mathematical modeling. Question addressed: is the model being used to elucidate or to obfuscate?;
# Adopt an `assumption hunting' attitude. Question addressed: what was `assumed out'? What are the tacit, pre-analytical, possibly normative assumptions underlying the analysis?;
# Detect Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Issue addressed: artificial deflation of uncertainty operated in order to achieve a desired inference at a desired level of confidence. It also works on the reverse practice, the artificial inflation of uncertainties, e.g. to deter regulation;
# Find sensitive assumptions before they find you. Issue addressed: anticipate criticism by doing careful homework via sensitivity and uncertainty analyses before publishing results.
# Aim for transparency. Issue addressed: stakeholders should be able to make sense of, and possibly replicate, the results of the analysis;
# Do the right sums, which is more important than `Do the sums right'. Issue addressed: is the viewpoint of a relevant stakeholder being neglected? Who decided that there was a problem and what the problem was?
# Focus the analysis on the key question answered by the model, exploring the entire space of the assumptions holistically. Issue addressed: don't perform perfunctory analyses that just `scratch the surface' of the system's potential uncertainties.

The first rule looks at the instrumental use of mathematical modeling to advance one's agenda. This use is called rhetorical, or strategic, like the use of Latin to confuse or obfuscate an interlocutor.

The second rule about `assumption hunting' is a reminder to look for what was assumed when the model was originally framed. Modes are full of [[ceteris paribus]] assumptions. For example, in economics, the model can predict the result of a shock to a given set of equations, assuming that all the rest - all other input variables and inputs - remain equal, but in real life "ceteris" are never "paribus", meaning that variables tend to be linked with one another, so they cannot realistically change independently of one another.

Rule three is about artificially exaggerating or playing down uncertainties wherever convenient. The tobacco lobbies exaggerated the uncertainties about the health effects of smoking according to Oreskes and Conway,&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;Oreskes N, Conway EM (2010) Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. Bloomsbury Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; while advocates of the death penalty played down the uncertainties in the negative relations between capital punishment and crime rate.&lt;ref name="Leamer"&gt;Leamer EE (2010) Tantalus on the road to asymptopia. Journal of Economic Perspectives 4(2):31-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the latter wanted the policy, in this case the death penalty, and were interested in showing that the supporting evidence was robust. In the former case the lobbies did not want regulation (e.g. bans on tobacco smoking in public places) and were hence interested in amplifying the uncertainty in the smoking-health effect causality relationship.

Rule four is about `confessing' uncertainties before going public with the analysis. This rule is also one of the commandments of applied econometrics according to
Kennedy:&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, P. (2007) A Guide to Econometrics, 5th ed., p.396, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; `Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity. Corollary: Thou shall anticipate criticism'. According to this rule, a [[sensitivity analysis]] should be performed before the results of a modeling study are published. There are many good reasons for doing this, one being that a carefully performed [[sensitivity analysis]] often uncovers plain coding mistakes or model inadequacies. The other is that, more often than not, the analysis reveals uncertainties that are larger than those anticipated by the model developers.

Rule five is about presenting the results of the modeling study in a transparent fashion. Both rules originate from the practice of impact assessment, where a modeling study presented without a proper SA, or as originating from a model which is in fact a black box, may end up being rejected by stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2014, When all models are wrong: More stringent quality criteria are needed for models used at the science-policy interface, Issues in Science and Technology, Winter 2014, 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both rules four and five suggest that reproducibility may be a condition for transparency and that this latter may be a condition for legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Cartesian"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2015 Evidence-based policy at the end of the Cartesian Dream: The case of mathematical modelling, in "The end of the Cartesian dream", Edited by Ângela Guimarães Pereira, and Silvio Funtowicz, Routledge, p. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule six, about doing the right sum, is not far from the `assumption-hunting' rule; it is just more general. It deals with the fact that often an analyst is set to work on an analysis arbitrarily framed to the advantage of a party. Sometime this comes via the choice of the discipline selected to do the analysis. Thus an environmental impact problem may be framed through the lenses of economics, and presented as a cost benefit or risk analysis, while the issue has little to do with costs or benefits or risks and a lot to do with profits, controls, and norms. An example is in Marris et al.&lt;ref name="Marris"&gt;Marris, C., Wynne, B., Simmons, P., and Weldon, Sue. 2001. Final Report of the PABE Research Project Funded by the Commission of European Communities, Contract number: FAIR CT98-3844 DG12-SSMI) Dec, Lancaster: University of Lancaster.
&lt;/ref&gt; on the issue of GMOs, mostly presented in the public discourse as a food safety issue while the spectrum of concerns of GMO opponents - including lay citizens - appears broader.

Rule seven is about avoiding a perfunctory [[sensitivity analysis]]. A SA where each uncertain input is moved at a time while leaving all other inputs fixed is perfunctory.&lt;ref name="OAT"&gt;Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, Environmental Modeling and Software, 25, 1508-1517&lt;/ref&gt; A true SA should make an honest effort at exploring all uncertainties simultaneously, leaving the model free to display its full nonlinear and possibly non-additive behaviour. A similar point is made in Sam L. Savage's book `The flaw of averages'.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;Savage SL (2009) The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questions addressed by sensitivity auditing ==

In conclusion, these rules are meant to help an analyst to anticipate criticism, in particular relating to model-based inference feeding into an impact assessment. What questions and objections may be received by the modeler? Here is a possible list:
* You treated X as a constant when we know it is uncertain by at least 30%
* It would be sufficient for a 5% error in X to make your statement about Z fragile
* Your model is but one of the plausible models - you neglected model uncertainty
* You have instrumentally maximized your level of confidence in the results
* Your model is a [[black box]] - why should I trust your results?
* You have artificially inflated the uncertainty
* Your framing is not socially robust
* You are answering the wrong question

== Sensitivity auditing in the European Commission Guidelines ==

Sensitivity auditing is described in the European Commission Guidelines for impact assessment &lt;ref name=IA /&gt;. Relevants excerpts are (pp. 392): 

:"[… ]where there is a major disagreement among stakeholders about the nature of the problem, … then sensitivity auditing is more suitable but sensitivity analysis is still advisable as one of the steps of sensitivity auditing."

:"Sensitivity auditing, […] is a wider consideration of the effect of all types of uncertainty, including structural assumptions embedded in the model, and subjective decisions taken in the framing of the problem." 

:"The ultimate aim is to communicate openly and honestly the extent to which particular models can be used to support policy decisions and what their limitations are."
 
:"In general sensitivity auditing stresses the idea of honestly communicating the extent to which model results can be trusted, taking into account as much as possible all forms of potential uncertainty, and to anticipate criticism by third parties."

'''Sheila Sen Jasanoff''' is an [[Indian American]] academic and significant contributor to the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]].

==Early life and education==
Born in India, Jasanoff attended [[Radcliffe College]], where she studied mathematics as an undergraduate, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1964.  She then studied linguistics, receiving her M.A. at the [[University of Bonn]] (then part of West Germany). She returned to Harvard to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics in 1973, and a J.D. at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1976. She practiced environmental law in Boston from 1976 to 1978. She and her husband then accepted positions at [[Cornell University]], where she became a pioneer in the newly emerging field of Science and Technology Studies. In 1998, Jasanoff joined the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of public policy. In 2002, she became Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies.&lt;ref name=Crimson2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Le|first1=Quynh-Nhu|title=Sheila S.

==Work==
Jasanoff founded and directs the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite web|title=Director: Sheila Jasanoff|url=http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/people/director.html|website=Program on Science, Technology &amp; Society|publisher=Kennedy School of Government Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on science and the state in contemporary democratic societies.  Her work is relevant to science &amp; technology studies, comparative politics, law and society, political and legal anthropology, sociology and policy analysis.  Jasanoff's research has considerable empirical breadth, spanning the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, and India, as well as emerging global regimes in areas such as climate and biotechnology.

One line of Jasanoff's work demonstrates how the political culture of different democratic societies influences how they assess evidence and expertise in policymaking.  Her first book (with Brickman and Ilgen), ''Controlling Chemicals'' (1985), examines the regulation of toxic substances in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman, Ilgen, and Jasanoff, ''Controlling Chemicals''.  Cornell University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book showed how the routines of decision making in these countries reflected different conceptions of what counts as evidence and of how expertise should operate in a policy context.  In ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'' (2005), she has shown how different societies employ different modes of public reasoning when making decisions involving science and technology.&lt;ref name=Ezrahi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezrahi|first1=Yaron|title=Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and 'Civic Epistemology'|journal=Metascience|date=7 May 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=177–198|doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'', Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   These differences, which in part reflect distinct "civic epistemologies," are deeply embedded in institutions and shape how policy issues are framed and processed by the bureaucratic machinery of  modern states.

Jasanoff has also contributed to scholarship on the interaction of science and law.  ''Science at the Bar'' (1995), for example, reached beyond the prevailing diagnoses of structural incompatibilities between science and law to explore how these socially embedded institutions interact and, to a certain extent, mutually constitute each other.&lt;ref name=Keniston&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keniston|first1=Kenneth|title=Book Review Science at the Bar: Law, science, and technology in America By Sheila Jasanoff. 285 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1995. $29.95. 0-674-79302-1|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 May 1996|volume=334|issue=19|pages=1274–1274|doi=10.1056/NEJM199605093341918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Science at the Bar'', Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of regulatory science, conducted for the purposes of meeting legally mandated standards, and the "boundary" drawing activities of science advisory committees are analyzed in ''The Fifth Branch'' (1990).&lt;ref name=Burger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Edward J.|title=Book Review The Fifth Branch: Science advisers as policy-makers By Sheila Jasanoff. 302 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1990. $27.95.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 May 1991|volume=324|issue=21|pages=1518–1518|doi=10.1056/NEJM199105233242124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''The Fifth Branch: Science Advisors as Policymakers'', Harvard University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;   More recently, she has explored the "rise of the statistical victim" in toxic torts, as the law with its individualistic orientation has increasingly encountered, and sought ways to accommodate, the statistical vision of such fields as epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "Science and the Statistical Victim: Modernizing Knowledge in Breast Implant Litigation," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 32, No. 1 (Feb., 2002), pp. 37-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work on science and law, as well as her research on science in the state, she takes an approach that links ideas from constitutional law, political theory, and science studies to consider the "constitutional" role of science in modern democratic states.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "In a Constitutional Moment," in ''Social Studies of Science and Technology: Looking back, Ahead'' (Bernward Joerges &amp; Helga Nowotny, eds., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff  has considered the [[politics of science]] not only in a comparative but also in a global context.  Examples include her work on the transnational aspects of the [[Bhopal disaster]] (''Learning from Disaster'' 1994);&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Oran R.|title=International cooperation : building regimes for natural resources and the environment|date=1989|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, Ny|isbn=978-0801495212|edition=3rd reprint.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U92Nw5FnGLsC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; her research on the formation and politics of global scientific advisory bodies such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]; and her research on national and global environmental movements (e.g., Earthy Politics, 2004).&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Eric|title=Why we argue about climate change|date=2013|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne|isbn=9781863956086|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X6f5d9w_tkC&amp;pg=PT31|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff also has contributed to building Science and Technology Studies as a field.  Prior to moving to Harvard, she was the founding chair of the [http://sts.cornell.edu/ Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies] at Cornell University.  She is also the founder of the [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/sdn/ Science &amp; Democracy Network], a group of scholars interested in the study of science and the state in democratic societies that has met annually since 2002.   Her research has been recognized with many awards, including the Bernal Prize from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Albert O. Hirschman Prize from the [[Social Science Research Council]].

==Personal==
She is married to [[Jay H. Jasanoff]], and has two children, [[Maya Jasanoff]], who is a professor in the Department of History at Harvard, and [[Alan Jasanoff]], who is a professor in the Department of Biological Engineering at [[MIT]]&lt;ref name="Crimson2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarvardMagazine"/&gt;

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

Unlike other subjects in the [[Scottish educational system]], those who take it are picked specially to do it, normally due to failings in other subjects or social issues. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]] in Moray, where it is taken as an additional compulsory standard grade by all pupils, giving most students a possible total of 9.

The '''St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-ru|Санкт-Петербургское отделение Математического института им. В. А. Стеклова РАН}}, abbreviated ПОМИ ('''POMI''') for "Петербургское отделение Математического института", Petersburg Department of the Mathematical Institute) is a mathematical research institute in [[St. Petersburg]], part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Until 1992 it was known as '''"Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]"''' (ЛОМИ, LOMI)

The name of the institution is a historical tradition and since 1995 it has no subordination to the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

The institute was established in 1940 as a department of the Steklov Institute and is named after [[Vladimir Andreevich Steklov]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]], [[mechanics|mechanician]] and [[physicist]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.imi.ras.ru/ru/institut/history.php Institute history]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Textual scholarship''' (or '''textual studies''') is an [[umbrella term]] for disciplines that deal with describing, transcribing, editing or annotating [[text (literary theory)|text]]s and physical [[document]]s. 

==Overview==
Textual research is mainly historically oriented. Textual [[scholar]]s study, for instance, how writing practices and printing technology has developed, how a certain writer has written and revised his or her texts, how literary documents have been edited, the history of reading culture, as well as censorship and the authenticity of texts. The subjects, methods and theoretical backgrounds of textual research vary widely, but what they have in common is an interest in the genesis and derivation of texts and textual variation in these practices.

There are many ways to think if you are a textual scholar, some are interested in what the author is trying to intend or there are those who seek to see how the text is transmitted.

Disciplines of textual scholarship include, among others, [[textual criticism]], [[stemmatology]], [[paleography]], [[genetic editing|genetic criticism]] (critique génétique), [[bibliography]] and [[history of the book]]. Textual scholar [[David Greetham (textual scholar)|David Greetham]] has described textual scholarship as a term encompassing "the procedures of enumerative bibliographers, descriptive, analytical, and historical bibliographers, paleographers and codicologists, textual editors, and annotators-cumulatively and collectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-0058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some disciplines of textual scholarship focus on certain material sources or text genres, such as [[epigraphy]], [[codicology]] and [[diplomatics]]. 

The historical roots of textual scholarship date back to the 3rd century BCE, when the scholarly activities of copying, comparing, describing and archiving texts became professionalized in the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, David C.:  ''Textual Scholarship.

'''''The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters''''', or ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', as it was originally known in Dutch, is a series of artist biographies with engraved portraits written by the 18th-century painter [[Arnold Houbraken]]. It was published in three volumes as a sequel to [[Karel van Mander]]'s own list of biographies known as the ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''. The first volume appeared in 1718, and was followed by the second volume in 1719, the year Houbraken died. The third and last volume was published posthumously by Houbraken's wife and children in 1721. This work is considered to be a very important source of information on 17th-century artists of the Netherlands. The ''Schouburg'' is listed as one of the 1000 most important works in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] from the Middle Ages to today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and influence==
The ''Schouburg'' was not the first sequel to Karel van Mander's work. Various authors had attempted to illustrate Van Mander's work and in 1649, [[Jan Meyssen]] published ''Image de divers hommes'' in imitation of [[Van Dyck|Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''. [[Cornelis de Bie]] published his ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]'' in 1662, [[André Félibien]] published his ''Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellents peintres anciens et modernes'' in 1666, and these were followed by [[Jacob von Sandrart]]'s illustrated ''Teutsche Akademie'' in 1668. Houbraken was very familiar with ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'', 1678, published by his teacher [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten|Samuel van Hoogstraten]] for students of art. [[Roger de Piles]] published ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres'' in the 1690s followed by [[Florent le Comte]] with his ''Cabinet des singularitez'' in 1699. As a gifted engraver, Houbraken wished to correct mistakes and omissions in these earlier works, while updating biographies with engraved portraits of artists. All of these works were used as sources for Houbraken and he mentions them in the first chapter of his first volume.

The ''Schouburg'' was published in three volumes, the first of which was simply meant as an addendum to Karel van Mander's work, and listed about 200 artists born between 1466 (starting with [[Erasmus]]) and 1613 (ending with [[Jacques van Artois]]) that had been omitted or whose lives extended beyond Van Mander's 1604 publication date. The popularity of this volume was such that a second volume was prepared immediately, while plans were made to continue the project up to the period in which Houbraken was writing at the start of the 18th century.

While leaning heavily on the sources already mentioned, Houbraken also consulted local history books of various cities in the Netherlands. Other, unpublished sources for his material came from various contacts via his professional network, mostly members of [[Guild of St. Luke|St. Luke Guilds]] in Holland. He listed many men who became members of the [[Bentvueghels]] group in [[Rome]] while on their [[Grand Tour]], but he also listed most of the men in a competency list drawn up by [[Vincent van der Vinne]] before he died in 1702. Houbraken kept to a system of importance where capitals meant very important, and lower case were honorable mentions. Though the capitalized names were meant for the index, the index of the first volume was far from complete at the time of publication. A later edition of all three books in 1756 contains an improved index and this book is now available on line in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]].

===Notable omissions===
The absence from Houbraken's work of several painters who are now much more highly regarded than very many painters he considered noteworthy, is an interesting feature of the work, and reveals changes in taste since his time; the most notorious omission is [[Jan Vermeer]], who is mentioned once in passing.  One must not forget however, that Houbraken himself died before publishing the final work, and he mentions again and again the impossibility of a complete list. In his first volume he includes painters that he complained were oversights by Karel van Mander, who he regarded as his greatest example. He highly respected all artist biographers who came before him, such as Sandrart, de Bie, and de Lairesse. In fact, Houbraken was quite keen to include painters that he thought were overlooked before him, and was quite thorough in his endeavors. Therefore, his omissions are equally the omissions of previous biographers, though it is Houbraken who receives all the blame. Unfortunately we don't know the exact state of his book at the time of his death, but his son Jacob, his daughter Antonina, and his wife all helped to patch things up for publication, and it is quite possible that their own opinions slipped into the finished work. In general, Houbraken tends to follow the contemporary prejudices of the [[hierarchy of genres]] and undervalue [[landscapist]]s, [[marine artist]]s and painters of [[still life]]. One can also speak of certain prejudices of the Houbraken family. These were in order:

* '''Family dynasties''': All painters who made up a family dynasty received extra space in the book. More space was given to the founder of the dynasty than to any other member (note that Houbraken considered himself the founder of his own family dynasty). An example is that though [[Rachel Ruysch]] was the most famous painter of her family, Houbraken devotes more space to her grandfather Pieter Post and his brother Frans. Similarly, though [[Wouter Crabeth II]] was the most famous painter of the family, Houbraken devotes more space to his illustrious heritage in Gouda, the glass painters Dirk and Wouter.
* '''Engravers''': Houbraken had a business of his own in biographical engravings, and his large family probably all helped in the business, with his son and daughter helping with the oval portraits. Houbraken was quick to realize the importance of reprints, and used them whenever possible for art provenance. He highly respected good engravings. Therefore he was heavily prejudiced towards artists who were also good draftsmen and engravers, such as Rembrandt and the Visschers. He includes also notes about various publishers and engravers, who did not paint at all.
* '''Rome''': Houbraken had great respect for all artists who took the trouble and overcame many hardships to travel to Rome. He went to great pains to add entries for the entire list of painters mentioned in a poem about the [[Bentvueghels]].
* '''Flattery''': As a Mennonite, Houbraken would have been against flattery; however, he writes again and again of the importance of flattering one's patrons in his books, and a recurring theme is when an artist fell onto bad times because he failed to flatter his patron. This type of artist is admired by Houbraken as a sort of "martyr to the artist's cause". Examples of flatterers that Houbraken deprecates are Anthony van Dyck  and Sir Peter Lely followers, and his omissions speak for themselves if we note famous portrait painters of his day such as [[Adriaen Hanneman]], [[Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck]] and [[Thomas de Keyser]]. Similarly, though architecture was considered one of the highest genre's, the popular "family portrait with a view of the house or garden" was omitted as a genre entirely from Houbraken's praise, since this just showed off the wealth of the sitters. Thus landscape-portraitists were often omitted or deprecated, such as [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]] and his wife.
* '''Religion''': Certainly Houbraken included artists of all religions in his book, but we can say that Mennonites are over-represented (see his story on the Mennonite martyr [[Jan Woutersz van Cuyck]]), while Catholics are under-represented. These were the De Grebbers, the De Brays, the Ruisdael family, Jan Vermeer, [[Adriaen Coorte]], Adriaen Hanneman, Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck, [[Hendrick Dubbels]], [[Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen]], [[Meindert Hobbema]], and others.

Other notorious omissions are [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Jan Wynants]], [[Jacobus Mancadan]],  [[Hendrick Avercamp]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer, Ruysch, and Leyster were mentioned, but only briefly.  The subject is dealt with in ''Arnold Houbraken's "Groote Schouburgh" and the Canon of Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting'', by Bart Cornelis, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 26, No. 3 (1998), pp. 144-161, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780895 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schilderessen==
Translated, the title of the book is ''Theatre of Painters and Paintresses'', indicating that Houbraken wrote about women painters, or ''schilderessen''. However, the list of women he included in the book is really quite short. Though he included short biographies of very many painters who were closely related to women painters, the only paintresses he included by name were: [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Anna Francisca de Bruijns]], [[Mayken Verhulst]], [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Margaretha van Godewijk]], [[Maria de Grebber]] (sister of [[Pieter de Grebber]]), [[Maria Potter]], [[Alida Withoos]], [[Catharina Oostfries]] (from a glaspainting family, married glasspainter [[Claes van der Meulen]]), [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Geertgen Wyntges]] (who he mentions as being the servant of Maria van Oosterwijk), [[Anna Katrina]], [[Catharina Rozee]] (1632–82), [[Adriana Spilberg]] (daughter of [[Johannes Spilberg]]), [[Rachel Ruysch]], the three sisters [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Françoise Katharina van Thielen]], and [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Marie Duchatel]], [[Diana Glauber]], [[Maria Sybilla Merian]], [[Margaretha Wulfraet]], and [[Johanna Koerten Blok]]. Of these, he included illustrations of only three women: Schurman, Merian, and Koerten-Blok. Houbraken also mentioned two poetesses; [[Gesina Brit]] and [[Catharina Questiers]].

Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.

==Purpose==
The American theologian [[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] argued that the political situation of the West following [[World War II]] set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

:Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilkey, "Plurality and Its Theological Implications", in ''The Myth of Christian Uniqueness: Toward a Pluralistic Theology of Religions'' (edited by [[John Hick]]), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Three-Point Model==
The most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Race |first=Alan |date=1982 |title= Christians and Religious Pluralism: Patterns in the Christian Theology of Religions |location= Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Pluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is [[John Hick]] of [[Claremont Graduate School]] in California, who first propounded it in his book ''God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)''. It has been notably criticized in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].

This is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.

To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of ''kerygmatic'' mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, "Conclusion," in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'', ed. Stanley N. Gundry, Dennis L. Okholm, and Timothy R. Phillips (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 205-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carroll Smith, "In Defense of a Christian Pluralism," Journal for the Renewal of Religion and Theology 5 (2009), available from http://renewtheology.org/paperCSmith0709.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path" (IV.11)&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;em&gt;Theology of Religion: Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by Imtitoshi Longkumer in "Issues in Mission and Evangelism in a Pluralistic Context: A New Paradigm Inquiry," &lt;em&gt;NCC Review,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. CXXXVII, No.01, Jan-Feb 2017 (Nagpur: National Council of Churches in India, 2017), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different.  To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, "Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism."  Hick considers himself a [[Theological critical realism|critical realist]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "Religious Pluralism and Islam," available from http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article11.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusivism===
[[Inclusivism]] is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, [[Karl Rahner]] (b. 1904-d.1984).{{Nonspecific|date=March 2012}}

One important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Acts 4:12 and 1 Timothy 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.

To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.

Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.

===Exclusivism===
Exclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are [[Samuel Zwemer]], [[Hendrik Kraemer]], and [[Lesslie Newbigin]].

Based on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gnanakan, The Pluralistic Predicament (Bangalore: TBT, 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Brunner &amp; Karl Barth, Natural Theology (London: Geoffrey Bles: The Centenary Press, 1946), pp. 74, 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.

An exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, [[Nehemiah Goreh]] could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the ''Bhagvadgita,''  the ''Bhagvata'', etc., yet they teach something of ''ananyabhakti'' (undivided devotedness to God), of ''vairagya'' (giving up the world), of ''namrata'' (humility), of ''ksama'' (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Proofs of the Divinity of Our Lord, as cited by R.H.S. Boyd in Indian Christian Theology (Delhi: ISPCK, 1969), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: "Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided". Religion "is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraemer, ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'' (1938), p. 40. Cited in {{cite book|author=Tim S. Perry|title=Radical Difference: A Defence of Hendrik Kraemer's Theology of Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FBFtVH_mOwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-377-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitter's Four-Point Model==
A significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by [[Paul F. Knitter]] in his 2002 book ''Introducing Theologies of Religions''. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.&lt;ref&gt; Introducing Theologies of Religions. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2002. 256 pp. {{ISBN|1-57075-419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Replacement Model===

This tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in [[Fundamentalist Christians|Fundamentalist]]/[[Evangelical]] churches, and largely represents the work of [[Karl Barth]]. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the [[World Council of Churches]] in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.

===The Fulfillment Model===

Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.

However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were "God's placeholder," often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.

Proponents of this view include [[Karl Rahner]], whose appreciation of the phrase "all grace is Christ's grace" led him to the controversial theory of "anonymous Christians" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Knitter, 72, 73. See also, Karl Rahner, “Christianity and the non-Christian Religions,” in Theological Investigations (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1966) 5:115-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mutuality Model===

This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. 

===The Acceptance Model===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

'''Time for Citizenship''' is a free website, initiated in 1999 by [[Primary education|Primary schools]] in the UK and Ireland. Since then, the site has expanded somewhat and now has a membership of over 4,000 schools. Its central tenets are to teach children to learn: 
to respect themselves, to respect others’ values and beliefs, to respect their environment, and to respect the law of the land.

Schools interact and share 'best practice' by submitting outstanding projects and children's Artwork. There are currently 38 projects featured on the site from the UK, France, [[South Africa]], Australia, India, Romania, Poland, Spain, Belarus, Greece, Canada, Lithuania, Ireland, Austria, Latvia and Portugal. The site is supported by the Treasury in the UK, [[HSBC]], [[Microsoft]] and [[CSEF]]. Schools and children receive prizes for their entries. A problem page exists for children to pose problems and be answered by their peers - a fine example of [[Mediation|Peer Mediation]].

The site has been endorsed by many of the UK and Ireland's leading politicians.

'''Training Analysis''' (sometimes called '''Training Needs Analysis''' (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.

== Introduction ==
Training Need Analysis(TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a procedure to determine whether training will indeed address the problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each aspect of an operational domain so that the initial skills, concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirjournal.com/guides/how-to-conduct-a-training-needs-analysis/|title=How to Conduct a Training Needs Analysis|publisher=Directory Journal|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.

==Design Integrated Training Analysis==
Tools and methods for an integrated approach, [[Design Integrated Training Analysis]], have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects.

==Training Analysis Process==
Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the [[man-in-the-loop]] has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, [[data assimilation]], communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology.   This has fueled the need for a formal approach.

The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-
* Psycho-motor Skills
* Procedural Skills
* Knowledge Transfer
* Communication Skills
* Colossal Thinking
* Attitude Learning
* Performance Training
* Physiological Stresses

The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the [[transfer of training]] elements into the operational environment.

For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.

There is a wide variety of training media that can be used, ranging from traditional lecture-based teaching to sophisticated simulators. Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas.

There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful.

Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.

A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime.

TST has considerable experience of successfully employing the accepted techniques applied to the development of training systems, including the [[Systems Approach to Training]] (SAT) in both the defence and civilian domains using customer specific standards such as JSP 822 where required.

Carrying out all TNA activates in accordance with SAT principles ensures rigorous visibility in each design stage with clear audit trails from the initial Scoping Study through to the recommended solution.

== Benefits ==

[[File:Coa_Illustration_Cross_Triquetra.svg|right|thumb|Interlaced triquetra which is a [[trefoil knot]]]]
'''Triquetra''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|t|r|ə}}; from the Latin adjective ''triquetrus'', three-cornered) denotes a particular complicated shape formed of three ''[[Vesica piscis|vesicae piscis]]'' (the leaf-like shape in between two equal diameter circles each centered on the circumference of the other), sometimes with an added circle in or around the three lobes. Also known as a "trinity knot" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to Odin's symbol, the [[valknut]].

==Ancient usage==

===Celtic art===
The triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen (2001). "[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]", ''Dalriada Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese use===
The triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Germanic paganism===
The triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Odin]].

===Christian use===
The symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 
It has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.

A very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of three forces. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.

==Modern use==
In contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Seán (1999). ''Story of the Claddagh Ring''. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|9781856351898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=October 2018}}

===Neopaganism===
It is difficult to date the exact origin of the Irish triquetra, and whether it was first used in a Christian or [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] context; the distinctive interlace/knotwork artistic style did not fully develop until ca. the 7th century AD, but the triquetra is the [[trefoil knot|simplest possible knot]]. [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.

Due to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),&lt;ref name="Mac Mathúna"&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].

[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.

The symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.&lt;ref name="scott-cunningham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
&lt;!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject. Other additions will be deleted as spam. --&gt;

The triquetra is often used artistically as a design element when [[Celtic knotwork]] is used. Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].

====In literature and publications====
*The double triquetra is used to represent the Holy Trinity on the ''New King James Version'' [[Bibles]], published by Thomas Nelson, Inc

====In television====
*[[Michonne]]'s [[katana]] in the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' features a triquetra on the inner [[crossguard]]. Custom-designed for the character, propmaster John Sanders intentionally chose the triquetra for its meaning as a triple goddess symbol.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/walking-dead-14-props-and-stories-behind-em/670478_michonnes-katana | title=Michonne's Katana | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | author=Ross, Dalton |author2=Snetiker, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/10/08/walkers-weapons-bees-at-amc-the-walking-dead/16886945/ | title=&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Walking Dead,' up close and personal | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | last=Keveney | first=Bill | quote=We put a trinity on there – mind, body, soul. That's important to who Michonne (Danai Gurira) is. We put some squares around it. And (executive producer) Robert Kirkman wanted a symbol that was like the biohazard symbol … so we put a triple goddess on there, which looks exactly like it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometry==
Topologically, the interlaced form of the plain triquetra is a [[trefoil knot]].
