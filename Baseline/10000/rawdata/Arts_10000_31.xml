{{for|the film|Journey Beyond Three Seas}}

'''''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas''''' ({{lang-ru|Хожение за три моря}}, ''Khozheniye za tri morya'') is a [[Russian literature|Russian]] literary monument in the form of travel notes, made by a [[merchant]] from [[Tver]], [[Afanasiy Nikitin]] during his journey to [[India]] in 1466–1472.

''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas'' was the first Russian literary work to depict a strictly [[commerce|commercial]], non-[[religious]] trip. Prior texts were pilgrimage texts, which depicted travel to holy sites and were more standardized, dry and conventional. The author visited the [[Caucasus]], [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], India and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. However, most of the notes are dedicated to India, its political structure, [[trade]], [[agriculture]], [[convention (norm)|custom]]s and ceremonies. The work is full of lyrical [[digression]]s and [[Autobiography|autobiographic]] passages. There is a strong individual, authorial presence. Its last page is in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the broken [[Arabic language]]; these are, in fact, typical Muslim prayers, indicating that Nikitin might have converted to [[Islam]] while he was in India, although his lapse from Christianity bothered him as he mentions several times in the text.&lt;ref&gt;For a translation of Nikitin's account, see Richard H. Major, ed. "The Travels of Athanasius Nikitin," tr. Mikhail M. Wielhorsky. In India ''in the Fifteenth Century''. Hakluyt Society, ser. 1. volume 22. (London: Hakluyt Society, 1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, however, Nikitin all time prays to [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Theotokos]], Christian Orthodox [[Saints]], tries to observe Christian rites, and so on.
The author did not make his way back to his native land; he died on the trip home. 
In 1475, the [[manuscript]] made its way to [[Moscow]] into the hands of a government official Vasili Mamyrev. Later on, it was incorporated into the [[annals|annalistic]] code of 1489, the [[Sofia Second Chronicle]] and the [[Lvov Chronicle]].

The '''American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society''' was created in 1895 as New York’s first organized preservation lobby. The Society operated as a national organization to protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America. &lt;ref&gt;"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society." ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no information about when the Society dissolved but there are no records of their activities after 1979.


==Projects==
The Society's primary purpose was to protect historic and/or scenic sites. In many cases, it acted as custodian for these properties, purchasing them, providing maintenance, and keeping them open to the public. Examples&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/mss/91 NYPL Archives - Collection Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; include:
* [[Battle Island State Park|Battle Island Park]]
* [[Fort Brewerton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort Brewerton will be restored by Historic Society||work=New York Times|issue=p. 11|date=November 23, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|Hamilton Grange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamilton Grange becomes memorial||work=New York Times|issue=p. 12, column 1|date=November 18, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Letchworth State Park|Letchworth Park]]
* [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]]
* [[Stony Point Battlefield|Stony Point Battlefield Reservation]]
* [[Watkins Glen State Park|Watkins Glen]]

==Awards==
The Society had responsibility for selecting the recipients of a number of Awards, the most prestigious being the [[Pugsley Medal]], created by [[Cornelius Amory Pugsley]] in 1928. The award honors champions of parks and conservation. After the dissolution of the Society, the Pugsley Medal was awarded by the [[National Park Foundation]]. In recent years, the Award has been presented by the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration.

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birmingham EBRI front.jpg|thumb|The front of the former Delicia Cinema, and later the Aston University Centre for the Arts. 12 Gosta Green, Birmingham, which Birmingham Arts Lab turned into the Triangle Arts Centre]]
The '''Birmingham Arts Laboratory''' or '''Arts Lab''' was an experimental [[arts centre]] and [[artist collective]] based in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] from 1968 to 1982 – an "arts and performance space dedicated to radical research into art and creativity".&lt;ref name="little-obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fox |title=Ted Little |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/ted-little-1116790.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Newspaper Publishing PLC |date=6 September 1999 |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loosely organised and biased towards the obscure and avant-garde, it was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1997 as "one of the emblematic institutions of the 1960s".&lt;ref name="barker-obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Hutchinson |title=Edward Barker: Lines from the underground |url= http://www.arsydd.btinternet.co.uk/edobituary.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=19 April 1997 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814062218/http://www.arsydd.btinternet.co.uk/edobituary.html |archivedate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab was originally based in a run-down youth centre run by The Birmingham Settlement on Tower Street in [[Newtown, Birmingham|Newtown]] on the northern edge of [[Birmingham City Centre]], and was accessible from the street only via a metal fire escape. It moved to a former brewery on Holt Street in [[Gosta Green]] in 1977, before financial problems and pressure from the arts establishment forced it to amalgamate with and take over [[Aston University]]'s Centre for the Arts on Gosta Green to form the more conventional '''Triangle Arts Centre''' in 1982.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimley |first=Terry |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |place=Birmingham |publisher=[[Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery]] |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Introduction |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Birmingham Arts Lab had a wide influence across numerous art forms. Figures involved with the Arts Lab, often early in their careers, included cartoonists [[Hunt Emerson]], [[Edward Barker (cartoonist)|Edward Barker]], [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], [[Bryan Talbot]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]] and [[Suzy Varty]];&lt;ref name="Skinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinn |first=Dez |title=Comix: The Underground Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DaISz0tCjMIC |year=2004 |place= |publisher=Collins &amp; Brown |isbn=1-84340-186-X |pages=193–194 |chapter=Hunt Emerson and Ar:Zak Comix}}&lt;/ref&gt; playwrights [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]; film director [[Mike Figgis]]; writer and poet [[Gareth Owen (writer)|Gareth Owen]]; comedian and performance artist [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]; photographer and journalist [[Derek Bishton]]; the psychedelic group [[Bachdenkel]]; novelist [[Jim Crace]]; singer [[Ruby Turner]], film maker and photographer [[Pogus Caesar]] and composer and sonic artist [[Trevor Wishart]].&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The genesis of the Birmingham Arts Laboratory can be traced to a meeting on 8 September 1968, of five figures (Mark Williams, Fred Smith, Dave Cassidy, Tony Jones and Bob Sheldon) from the [[mac (Birmingham)|Midlands Arts Centre]], who had been promoting avant garde music performances at the centre's outdoor auditorium and had been involved in [[Mike Leigh]]'s experiments in improvised theatre, but had become frustrated at what they saw as the bureaucracy and obstructionism of the centre's management.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt; The group resolved to start a breakaway venue to "provide a centre for experimenting in the Arts; be a community of creative people, self-aware and self-supporting; participate creatively in the life of the City; and present work of both its members and visiting groups and individuals"&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |editor= |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |origyear=1969 |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery |place=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Published aims of the Arts Lab (reprinted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed five months of fund-raising events around the city called Strange Days and featuring bands such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]] and DJ [[John Peel]] (whose fundraising efforts saw him became the Arts Lab's first life member), during which a local charity offered the group the use of a first floor room in its [[Newtown, Birmingham|Newtown]] Youth Centre as a venue. The Arts Lab opened in January 1969, initially only at weekends.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{harvnb|BMAG|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Grimley, later arts correspondent of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', recalled "When I first found my way to the Arts Lab, it did not resemble an arts centre so much as a night club with a rather different ambience to other places in town. Nothing happened except at weekends, and not much happened then either, except that music was played, coloured lights were projected and people ate vegetables and brown rice and drank instant coffee."&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt;

===Tower Street===
The Arts Lab was open full-time from April 1969. Initially occupying only a single room, it quickly established cinema and theatre programmes and in its first year held two experimental arts festivals – ''Cybervironment Plus'' organised by Simon Chapman and ''Gathering Number One'' organised by Pete Stark. Funding from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] from 1971 secured its future and saw it gradually expand: firstly to occupy the whole first floor (with the gymnasium becoming the main theatre and performance space), and eventually to occupy the entire building.

The Arts Lab was initially run along the lines of a club for members and guests.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Although it never had a drinks licence (due to constant friction with the local licensing authorities) it had a coffee bar, beneath which was a void between the floors in which several members intermittently lived. [[Jim Crace]] later recalled that "it was no surprise to discover a badly-smelling playwright or drink-wrecked mime artist emerging between your legs from a priest hole below the floorboards".&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crace |first=Jim |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery |place=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Birmingham Arts Lab: Remembered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab started with no formal organisation, but with Peter Stark as unofficial administrator. Stark left in 1970 and was replaced by Simon Chapman, who left in 1972 to become the Director of the [[Ikon Gallery]] and was replaced by [[Ted Little]]. Little was to be artistic director through to 1982, apart from a two-year spell as head of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in [[London]], during which he transformed it "from a club for the self-absorbed of Kensington to a roaring popular venue" and paved the way for its important role in the early years of British [[punk rock|punk]].&lt;ref name="little-obit"/&gt;

===Holt Street===
The Arts Lab's earlier chaotic, co-operative organisation was increasingly challenged by funders from 1975 onwards, with a formal Board of Management being established in 1976. August 1977 saw the Arts Lab move completely from Tower Street to new, much larger premises in a former brewery on the campus of [[Aston University]], with a bookshop, studios and exhibition spaces. Shortage of funds meant that not all of the planned facilities were finished, however, and the new more orderly surroundings were felt by some to have compromised the Arts Lab's uniquely liberating culture.&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"/&gt;

The first signs of problems became apparent in 1980 when two members of the music staff were made redundant and [[Ted Little]] left to pursue freelance work. The Arts Lab's programme began to focus increasingly on film to the exclusion of other media. In 1982 West Midlands Arts sponsored a move to combine the Arts Lab with Aston University's own Centre for the Arts (with the resultant demise of the Centre for the Arts, which had previously been a popular, thriving, live performance arts venue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/972394445|title=UP THE FIRE ESCAPE AND THROUGH THE KITCHENS.|last=CLIFF.|first=DIX,|date=2015|publisher=COMPLETELYNOVEL|isbn=9781849146111|location=[S.l.]|oclc=972394445}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a venue focussing primarily on cinema and photography, and in 1983 the Arts Lab's premises reopened as a new Arts Centre called the Triangle Media and Arts Centre. Funding for this was removed in 1987, however, and the cinema finally closed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Grimley |title=Looking back on good old 70s: The Arts Lab was a great launching platform, says Terry Grimley |newspaper=[[Birmingham Post]] |publisher=Mirror Regional Newspapers |page=15 |date=3 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and influence==
===Theatre and performance===
The Arts Lab's theatre programme was controversial from its start in 1969, with a nude open-air performance on the Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the ''Birmingham Post''. By 1971 there was a regular programme of visiting theatre companies - mainly radical [[performance art]] groups such as the [[People Show]], [[Pip Simmons Theatre Group]] and [[John Bull Puncture Repair Kit]] - together with performances by the Arts Lab's own theatre company '''Zoo'''.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;

A regular Theatre Workshop was established from 1973, and the following years saw a series of plays written specifically for the Arts Lab including [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]'s ''Stillsmith'', [[Gareth Owen (writer)|Gareth Owen]]'s ''Confession of Jon-Jak Crusoe'' and his rock operetta ''Rupert'', [[Bruce Lacey|Bruce Lacey and Jill Bruce]]'s ''Stella Superstar and Her Amazing Intergalactic Adventures''&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; and most notably [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s ''Summer Sports'', later revived as ''Blood Sports'' and still widely performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edgar |first=David |authorlink=David Edgar (playwright) |title=Edgar: Shorts |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FtYX_9YGQl8C |accessdate=21 November 2008 |year=1989 |place= |publisher=Nick Hern Books |isbn=1-85459-051-0 |page=vii |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1976 the '''Performance Group''' - based at the Arts Lab but touring internationally - produced a range of shows that combined dance, film, text, poetry, electronics and ambient music; declaring "Total Theatre, Mixed or Multimedia, Compound Theatre are all terms we use in this connection",&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; and from 1976 the '''Writers' Theatre Company''' provided an outlet for the professional production of work by young local writers. The Arts Lab was also notable as a [[Stand-up comedy|comedy]] venue, with [[Stewart Lee]] crediting [[Victoria Wood]] and [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]'s work at the Arts Lab as being one of the earliest roots of the later [[alternative comedy]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefixonline.com/features.php?id=148 |title=Simon Munnery and Stewart Lee in Conversation |accessdate=23 November 2008 |last=Lee |first=Stewart |authorlink=Stewart Lee |date=November 2007 |work=The Fix Online |publisher= |quote=You know, people say alternative started in ’79, but there were people like Victoria Wood and John Dowie who were both coming out of the Arts Lab in Birmingham. Dowie was doing what you would recognise as modern stand up in a decade when it was not wanted at all  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311170314/http://www.thefixonline.com/features.php?id=148 |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Janice Connolly, who later became comedy character Mrs Barbara Nice, performed at Tower Street in a piece directed by John Dowie from a Hunt Emerson cartoon "Dog Man".

===Cinema===
The Arts Lab's cinema programme was established by Tony Jones – the first film shown being ''[[Medium Cool]]'' by [[Haskell Wexler]], which had never before seen in the UK&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; – and it continued after the programmes in most other media went into decline from 1980 onwards. The reputation of the Arts Lab's Tower Street venue as "the world's most uncomfortable cinema, the silence only broken by the accompaniment of some thrasher on the piano and the timpani of scurrying rats"&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"/&gt; was partly explained by the fact that the seating had been bought second-hand from a local cinema.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt; In addition to its regular programme the Arts Lab held an annual Film Festival from 1972, focussing on particular themes including film makers such as [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Josef von Sternberg]] or [[F. W. Murnau]], or 1976's focus on [[Cinema of Poland|Polish Cinema]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Jones left the Arts Lab in 1978 to join the Cambridge Film Theatre.

===Music===
The Arts Lab's music programme was defiantly aimed at "presenting contemporary music in Birmingham on a regular basis, regardless of the support it may or may not receive", starting off with a then-unusual all-[[Bartók]] concert by the [[Lindsay String Quartet]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; 1970 saw the foundation of the '''Arts Lab Sound Workshop''' by Jolyon Laycock, which produced a series of experimental sound performances throughout the 1970s involving [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], [[electronic music]], [[Audio amplifier|amplification effects]] and  [[liquid light shows]], in regular collaboration with artists such as [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[David Panton]], [[Trevor Wishart]] and various ensembles associated with the [[University of Birmingham]], often touring through Europe and North America. Notable premieres included Wishart's ''Menagerie'' and ''Audio Movies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stalk.net/paradigm/pd03.html |title=Trevor Wishart – Beach singularity/Menagerie/Vocalise |accessdate=21 November 2008 |work=Releases |publisher=Paradigm Discs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab also developed a reputation as a centre of improvised [[rock music|rock]], running from the [[psychedelia]] of [[Bachdenkel]] in the late 1960s, through the Arts Lab's own '''Amphioxus''' [[jazz-rock]] ensemble of the mid-seventies, to later collaborative performances at [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]].

===Art, comics and poster art===
The Arts Lab had a printing operation from its establishment in 1969, set up by Bryan Brown and Simon Chapman whose work was influenced by the psychedelic imagery of the West Coast of America.  It initially used [[silkscreen printing]] to produce [[posters]] for Arts Lab events, and raising funds by producing posters for local Student Unions and music promotors. The posters operation was later taken over by [[Bob Linney]] and [[Ken Meharg]] for the Arts Lab – emphasising simultaneous colour contrasts and the dynamic integration of hand-painted text with manipulated photographic imagery – were especially notable, being the subject of an international touring exhibition by the [[British Council]] between 1981 and 1985,&lt;ref name="Meharg-Linney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sidey |first=Tessa |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery |location=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |pages= |chapter=Bob Linney and Ken Meharg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibition by [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] in 1998. Ernie Hudson was particularly renown for his revolutionary multiple colour silk screen prints produced during this time, notably posters for John Peel at Aston University, and various bands at the time. Although few remain, those that do are archived in Birmingham Museum and Art gallery. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Edmonds |title=Memory of unique Birmingham experiment. Richard Edmonds visits the Museum and Art Gallery's exhibition about Birmingham's 1970s experimental arts centre, the Arts Lab |newspaper=Birmingham Post |publisher=Mirror Regional Newspapers |page=14 |date=7 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Arts Lab obtained an [[Offset printing|offset]] [[Lithography|litho]] press on loan from a local cash and carry operation (in return for printing the company's price list for free) and in 1972 bought a second hand press of its own. Initially intended to print flyers and price lists on a commercial basis, the take-over of the printing operation by [[Hunt Emerson]] in 1974 saw the Arts Lab move into comic art, producing a series of publications under its own '''Ar:Zak''' imprint.&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt; Starting with Emerson's own ''Large Cow Comix'' – which also featured work by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] and [[Bryan Talbot]]&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt; – and eventually branching out such varied publications as [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]'s ''Big Foot''; [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s anti-Nazi ''Committed Comix'' and [[Suzy Varty]]'s ''Heroine'' (the first British women's comic),&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Ar:Zak was to become an important part of the history of underground British comics, a position reinforced when the Arts Lab held ''KAK'' – the first ''Konvention of Alternative Komix'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt;

'''''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness''''' is a 2012 [[New York Times Bestselling]] [[autobiography]] by ''[[New York Post]]'' writer [[Susannah Cahalan]]. The book details Cahalan's struggle with a rare [[autoimmune disease]] and her recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couric |first=Katie |title=Brain on Fire: Susannah Cahalan’s Medical Mystery |url=http://katiecouric.com/videos/brain-on-fire-susannah-cahalans-medical-mystery/ |publisher=KatieCouric.com |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108113621/http://katiecouric.com/videos/brain-on-fire-susannah-cahalans-medical-mystery/ |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first published on November 13, 2012 through [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] in hardback, and was later reprinted in paperback by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] after the two companies merged. 

==Synopsis==
The book narrates Cahalan's issues with [[anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]] and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of [[encephalitis]]. She wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month, during which time she would have violent episodes and delusions. Her eventual diagnosis is made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as "partying too much" and [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahn |first=Jennifer |title=Under Attack: One Woman's Terrifying Battle With an Auto-Immune Disease |url=http://www.oprah.com/health/Susannah-Cahalan-Interview-Brain-on-Fire |publisher=Oprah |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026000343/http://www.oprah.com/health/Susannah-Cahalan-Interview-Brain-on-Fire |archivedate=October 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually several physicians, including Dr. [[Souhel Najjar]], began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an [[autoimmune disease]].&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite web|last=Forman MD |first=Howard |title=Brain on Fire: An Interview With Susannah Cahalan on Anti–NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/brain-fire-interview-susannah-cahalan-anti%E2%80%93nmda-receptor-autoimmune-encephalitis |newspaper=[[Psychiatric Times]] |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705110220/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/brain-fire-interview-susannah-cahalan-anti%E2%80%93nmda-receptor-autoimmune-encephalitis |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Cahalan, ''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness'', pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also covers Cahalan's life after her recovery, including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital. Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization, as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; While researching, she learned that the disease had only been discovered three years before she became ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edemariam |first=Aida |title=Brain on Fire by Susannah Cahalan - review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/24/brain-fire-susannah-cahalan-review |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714231556/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/24/brain-fire-susannah-cahalan-review |deadurl=no |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research indicated that in 2009 most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Cahalan, ''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness'', pp. 221-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Brain on Fire'' has been mostly positive. [[NPR]] commented that the author was "a naturally talented prose stylist" and that "she perfectly tempers her brutal honesty with compassion and something like vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schaub |first=Michael |title='Brain On Fire' Details An Out-Of-Mind Experience |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/164400198/brain-on-fire-details-an-out-of-mind-experience |work=[[NPR]] |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720074459/http://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/164400198/brain-on-fire-details-an-out-of-mind-experience |deadurl=no |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' praised Cahalan's researching abilities for the book, as they noted that she had to rely on information from others, including family members and medical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scarf|first=Maggie|title=‘Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness’ by Susannah Cahalan|date=January 12, 2013|accessdate=January 8, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/brain-on-fire-my-month-of-madness-by-susannah-cahalan/2013/01/12/d5e5ffcc-43c3-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Branchwork''' or branch tracery ({{lang-de|Astwerk }}) is a type of architectural ornament often used in late [[Gothic architecture]] and the [[Northern Renaissance]], consisting of knobbly, intertwined and leafless branches. Branchwork was particularly widespread in Central European art between 1480 and 1520 and can be found in all media. The intellectual origin of branchwork lies in theories in [[Renaissance humanism]] about the origins of architecture in natural forms and barely-treated natural materials.

In artistic terms it often follows [[Scroll (art)|scrolling patterns]] that had long been used with thinner stem and tendril plant forms.  The development of the representation of thicker tree branches had a long history in the crosses in representations of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], and the popular subject of the [[Tree of Jesse]].

== Origins and meanings ==
Traditionally branchwork was conceived as a typical ornament of late Gothic art in the lands north of the Alps. Only recently has the connection between the vegetal architectural forms in branchwork and theories of early Renaissance humanism about the origins of architecture been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Crossley: ''The Return to the Forest: Natural Architecture and the German Past in the Age of Dürer.'' In: Thomas W. Gaehtgens (ed.): Künstlerischer Austausch, Akten des 28. Internationalen Kongresses für Kunstgeschichte. vol 2, Berlin 1993, pp. 71–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the increased appearance of branchwork in art from the last third of the 15th century, there is evidence in the treatise literature of an architectural theoretical background to this form of design that recalls [[Vitruvius]]'s concept of the "[[The Primitive Hut|Primitive Hut]]".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert: On Adams House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History. New York: Museum of Modern Art. 1972 {{ISBN|0870705121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[De architectura]]'' Vitruvius creates a model for the emergence of architecture from nature, according to which the first people would have built their dwellings from vertical forks of branches with branches laid over them. [[Filarete]] also takes up this idea in his manuscript ''Trattato di Archittetura'', in which he explains the origin of the [[arch]] as the first doorway. In the early 16th century similar explanations can be found in the writings of [[Raphael]], among others.

The derivation of the Gothic [[ogive|ogival]] arch from branches tied together from trees found another historical basis in ''[[Germania (book)|De Germania]]'' by the Roman author [[Tacitus]] (c. 98 AD) which was rediscovered in the early 15th century by humanist scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Krebs: A Most Dangerous Book. Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich. W. W. Norton 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that the Germans worshipped their gods in the forests. The particularities of Gothic architecture north of the Alps – pointed arch vaults in analogy to the canopy of leaves of the Germanic groves – are interpreted by early German humanists as their own national antiquity. Cardinal [[Francesco Todeschini-Piccolomini]] (1439–1503), who was in possession of the copy of ''Germania'' of his uncle, [[Pope Pius II]], played a decisive role in the reception of Tacitus by German scholars. Several copies of this found their way across the Alps via [[Regensburg]].

== Use ==
In [[Central Europe]]an art of the 15th and 16th centuries, architectural elements were often replaced by branches. In stone sculpture, the juxtaposition of architectural and natural elements, such as branches, takes on a further level. First a wooden branch is imitated in stone, which then replaces a component.

A very early example of this new approach to architecture is the vault in the west choir of [[Eichstätt Cathedral]] (dated 1471), where the architectural ribs are presented in the shape of a round staff of branches. Here Wilhelm von Reichenau, humanist and bishop of Eichstätt, can be identified as a source of ideas and intellectual background. Wilhelm had studied together with Johannes Pirckheimer, the father of [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], at the [[University of Padua]] and represents a typical early representative of early [[Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe|Humanism in Germany]] with Italian roots. In Johannes Pirckheimer's library there was also a copy of the ''Germania'', which he probably had acquired during his studies in the 1460s.&lt;ref&gt;See Dieter Mertens: ''Die Instrumentalisierung der Germania des Tacitus durch die deutschen Humanisten.'' In: Heinrich Beck (ed.): Zur Geschichte der Gleichung germanisch – deutsch. Sprache und Namen, Geschichte und Institutionen. Berlin 2004, pp. 37–101, here pp. 39 and 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eichstätt, with the so-called "beautiful column" (''Schöne Säule'') of 1489 in the Mortuarium of the cathedral, there is a further, later example of the use of branchwork. At the same time, this pillar with a twisted shaft is an early example of the revival of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms and stylistic features in the 15th century architecture. This style of an Romanesque Renaissance, understood as specifically northern Alpine antiquity, was first used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] for depicting ancient buildings and was also received as an inspiration for new architectural motifs in Germany from around 1460 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Hoppe: ''Romanik als Antike und die baulichen Folgen. Mutmaßungen zu einem in Vergessenheit geratenen Diskurs''. In: Norbert Nußbaum et al. (Hrsg.): Wege zur Renaissance. Beobachtungen zu den Anfängen neuzeitlicher Kunstauffassung im Rheinland und den Nachbargebieten um 1500, Cologne 2003, pp. 89–131 [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/996/ Online version].&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the interlinking of architectural and vegetable form is [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s ''Heilig-Blut-Altar'' ([[St. James's Church, Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], 1501/05). Here, the canopies are formed by intertwined branches, which in turn are crowned by an architectural [[finial]]. This artistic approach deliberately broke with the expected order and with the comprehensibility of the architectural system.

Similarly, the monumental north portal of the [[Benedictine]] monastery church in [[Chemnitz]], which was built in 1525 by the wood carver and stone sculpture Franz Maidburg, combines pre-Gothic (Romanesque) forms like rounded arches with branchwork. Both the style and the figurative program with the founders of the 12th century emperor [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]] refer here to the distant foundation of the monastery and emphasize the age and venerability of the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Hoppe: ''Stildiskurse, Architekturfiktionen und Relikte. Beobachtungen in Halle, Chemnitz und Heilbronn zum Einfluss der Bildkünste auf mitteleuropäische Werkmeister um 1500''. In: Stefan Bürger und Bruno Klein (Hg.): Werkmeister der Spätgotik. Position und Rolle der Architekten im Bauwesen des 14. bis 16. Jahrhunderts. Darmstadt 2009, pp. 69–91 [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/1010 online version].&lt;/ref&gt;
Also [[Donato Bramante|Bramante's]] tree pillars in the cloister of [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]] are such an implementation of the architectural theoretical discourse.

'''Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England''' refers to the [[grave (burial)|grave]] and [[burial]] customs followed by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] between the mid 5th and 11th centuries CE in [[Anglo-Saxon England|Early Mediaeval England]]. There was "an immense range of variation" of burial practice performed by the Anglo-Saxon peoples during this period,&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 275"&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; with them making use of both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]]. In most cases, the "two modes of burial were given to both wealthy and ordinary individuals", and in many cases were found alongside one another in the same cemetery.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 275"/&gt; Both of these forms of burial were typically accompanied by [[grave goods]], which included food, jewellery and weaponry. The actual burials themselves, whether of cremated or inhumed remains, were placed in a variety of sites, including in [[cemeteries]], [[burial mounds]] or, more rarely, in [[ship burial]]s.

Within the areas of Anglo-Saxon settlement, there was both regional and temporal variation while burial practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luc00|Lucy 2000]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Anglo-Saxons were followers of a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan religion]], which is reflected in their burials from this time, while they later converted to [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Christianity]] in the seventh and eighth centuries CE, which was again reflected in their burial practices, when cremation ceased to be practiced and inhumation became the sole form of burial, typically being concentrated in Christian cemeteries located adjacent to churches.

In the eighteenth century, [[antiquarianism|antiquarians]] took an interest in these burials, and began excavating them, although more scientific excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of [[archaeology]]. Prominent Anglo-Saxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of [[Spong Hill]] in [[Norfolk]] and the great sixth-seventh century ship burial of [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]].

==History==
[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|200px|A map showing the general locations of the Anglo-Saxon peoples around the year 600, based upon Bede's account.]]
The early Anglo-Saxon period in England lasted from the fifth to the eighth centuries CE, during which time burial was the common custom for disposing of the dead. Archaeologists believe that the treatment of the deceased was important to Anglo-Saxons due to the "rich variation" in burial rites from this era,{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=65}} and that different forms of burial reflect differences in the status, wealth, sex and/or gender, age, and tribal affiliation of the dead.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=135}} There was greater variation in burial types than at most earlier periods of British history, with early Anglo-Saxon graves differing greatly from those found in the preceding period of [[Roman Britain]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=135}} The common Romano-British form of disposal was inhumation, although some rare cremations had taken place.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=119}}

During the [[Anglo-Saxon migration]], which began in the fifth century CE, Germanic-speaking tribes from continental northern Europe, such as the [[Angles]], [[Jutes]] and [[Saxons]], arrived in Britain, where their own culture—with its accompanying [[Old English|language]] and [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan religion]]—became dominant across much of eastern Britain. Those Romano-British peoples still residing in these areas either adopted and integrated with this incoming culture or migrated westward.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The Anglo-Saxons brought with them their own heterogenous forms of burial practice, which were distinct from those of the British peoples living in western and northern Britain during the Early Medieval,{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=1}} having more in common with those of pagan continental Europe.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=4}} However, not all of those given an Anglo-Saxon burial at this time were necessarily migrants or the descendents of migrants from continental Europe. Some may have been ethnically descended from the earlier Romano-British people, but who had adopted Anglo-Saxon culture as it became dominant across southern and eastern Britain.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=4}} An example of such cohabitation can be seen at Wasperton and Stretton-on-the-Fosse in [[Warwickshire]], where Anglo-Saxon graves were found alongside those that were Romano-British in character.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=138}}

In the seventh century, foreign Christian missionaries initiated the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England, with repercussions for burial practices.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=138}} Though common in the fifth and sixth centuries, cremation rapidly declined as a form of burial, with few known later examples.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=119}} The Christian Church initially objected little to grave goods, although there was a decline in their popularity as they came to be understood as irrelevant. Instances of rich grave goods would however continue into the eighth century.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Taylor|2001|pp=138&amp;ndash;139}}

==Early Anglo-Saxon period==

===Inhumations===
[[File:The Sandman - geograph.org.uk - 1000294.jpg|thumb|right|Inhumation at Sutton Hoo under archaeological excavation.]]
The most common way for Anglo-Saxon communities to deal with their dead was through [[inhumation]], the burial of the corpse straight into the ground. This form of corpse disposal would have taken less "time and equipment" than cremation.{{sfn|Meaney|1964|p=17}} Such inhumations remain an "invaluable resource" for understanding Early Medieval society.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=36}} In many cases, [[alkaline]] soils have led to the good preservation of the skeletal remains, enabling archaeologists to excavate inhumed corpses and gain "a great deal of information" from them. Data that can be gathered or inferred from Anglo-Saxon inhumations includes the [[biological sex]] or age of the individual, as well as information about their health or lifestyle.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=65}} Isotopic analysis of the skeletons can be used to detect which region the individual grew up in.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=81}}

Graves for Anglo-Saxon inhumations varied widely in size, from "a shallow scoop in the ground to a large pit with regular sides over 2 m[etres] long and over 1 m[etre] deep."{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=97}} Although most Anglo-Saxon inhumation burials were of individuals, it is "reasonably common" to find multiple burials from the period. These multiple burials most often contain a couple, quite commonly an adult and a child. In some rarer cases there were three or more individuals buried in a single grave.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=82}}

====Positions====
The bodies in Anglo-Saxon inhumations are found in a variety of positions. They have been found "placed on the back (supine), front (prone), or on one side. The legs can be arranged straight out, be crossed at the lower leg or ankle, be slightly bent (flexed), or even pulled right up to the chest in a foetal position (crouched or contracted)."{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=78}} According to archaeologist [[David M. Wilson|David Wilson]], the "usual orientation" for pagan inhumations was with the head to the west and feet to the east, although there are many exceptions to this.{{sfn|Wilson|1992|p=87}}

Those inhumations containing a corpse lying on their side may have been laid out such for various reasons. At [[Horton Kirby]] in [[Kent]], it appears that the corpses were bent into such a position in order to fit into their small graves.{{sfn|Spurrell|1889|pp=214–315}} Contrastingly, other examples show side-orientated bodies placed into graves "of ample size and sometimes of quite large dimensions."{{sfn|Lucy|2000|80}} Those Anglo-Saxon corpses that have been found prone, or face down in their grave, have been interpreted by some archaeologists as having been "live burials", where the individual was thrown into the grave and [[premature burial|buried alive]].{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=78}} Other archaeologists have interpreted such burials in different ways, leading Sam Lucy to claim that "There is probably no single explanation for the use of prone burial" amongst the Anglo-Saxons. "In some cases it may be accidental, especially if the burial was in a coffin which had been clumsily handled. In other cases it might have specific significance attached to it".{{sfn|Lucy|2000|80}}

====Mutilations and decapitations====
In some cases, the body was mutilated prior to burial, primarily through [[decapitation]], and there are examples of entire cemeteries being filled with these decapitated corpses, leading archaeologists to conclude that these were sites specifically for the burial of executed individuals.&lt;ref name="Lucy 2000. p. 75"&gt;[[#Luc00|Lucy 2000]]. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There are few examples of these possible execution cemeteries from the early Anglo-Saxon period, with one exception being the barrow cemetery at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="Lucy 2000. p. 75"/&gt; Here, several burials containing the corpses of individuals who had been hanged, beheaded or in other way mutilated were placed around Mound 5 on the eastern side of the cemetery. Using [[radiocarbon dating]], archaeologists have determined that the earliest of these may well date from the seventh century CE, and that they continued to be deposited at the site into the ninth and tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car98|Carver 1998]] p. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples of probable Anglo-Saxon execution cemeteries that date from the tenth or eleventh centuries have been found at Five Knolls in [[Dunstable]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dun31|Dunning and Wheeler 1931]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Bran Ditch in [[Fowlmere]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fox26|Fox and Palmer 1926]]. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Let29|Lethbridge 1929]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also examples of decapitated corpses who have been buried in ordinary Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. One unusual example has been found at Loveden Hill in [[Lincolnshire]], where one of the corpses had their head placed on their stomach, and an urn was placed where the head would have been.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea64|Meaney 1964]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Great Addington]] in [[Northamptonshire]], three decapitated skeletons had been found with stones in place of their heads,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith 1902]]. pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; while at [[Chadlington]] in [[Oxfordshire]] two corpses had their decapitated heads placed between their legs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee39|Leeds 1939]]. pp. 357–358.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Mitcham]] in [[Surrey]] several inhumations contained extra heads, while other graves instead had none or had them placed at the corpses' feet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In some rare cases, at sites in Bideford-on-Avon in [[Warwickshire]] and [[Port Way|Portway]] in [[Hampshire]], skulls had been buried on their own by the Anglo-Saxons, without their accompanying bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ritual elements====
Certain Anglo-Saxon burials appeared to have ritualistic elements to them, implying that a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] religious rite was performed over them during the funeral. while there are many multiple burials, where more than one corpse was found in a single grave, that date from the Anglo-Saxon period, there is "a small group of such burials where an interpretation involving ritual practices may be possible". For instance, at [[Welbeck Hill]] in [[Lincolnshire]], the corpse of a decapitated woman was placed in reverse on top of the body of an old man, while in a number of other similar examples, female bodies were again placed above those of men. This has led some archaeologists to suspect a form of [[suttee]], where the female was the spouse of the male, and was killed to accompany him upon death. Other theories hold that the females were slaves who were viewed as the property of the men, and who were again killed to accompany their master.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. pp. 71–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, four Anglo-Saxon burials have been excavated where it appears that the individual was buried while still alive, which could imply that this was a part of either a religious rite or as a form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cremations===
[[File:Pashupatinath Temple Cremation.jpg|left|thumb|Anglo-Saxon cremation was open and public, like that in contemporary South Asia (pictured).]]
Alongside inhumation, it was common for early Anglo-Saxons to [[cremation|cremate]] their dead by burning the corpses and then burying the cremated remains within an [[urn]]. Cremation rites declined in the seventh century, but throughout that century remained a viable form of burial at sites like St Mary's Stadium in [[Southampton]].{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=87}}
Archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]] suggested that cremation was performed to "release the spirit" from the body after death,{{sfn|Meaney|1964|p=16}} while [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]] remarked that cremation rites presented "the public transformation of the dead body."{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=86}} Archaeological understandings of the Anglo-Saxon cremation processes have been largely reconstructed from an osteological analyses of the cemeteries at Spong Hill and Sancton.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=86}} The pyre sites are rarely archaeologically identifiable.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=87}}

The method of Anglo-Saxon cremation is still debated; based on an examination of cremated remains at [[Illington]], Calvin Wells speculated that at that site, the bodies had been laid out on the ground, with a pyre then built on top of them before being set alight. Wells believed that this would explain why the shoulder tips of corpses at the site were not always properly cremated.{{sfn|Wells|1960}} This idea was criticised by Jacqueline McKinley, who argued that such a process would lack sufficient [[oxygen]] to cremate the entire body. Instead she argued that Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres were most likely a criss-cross of timbers filled with brushwood, with the corpse laid on top.{{sfn|McKinley|1994|p=83}} The process of cremating the body would likely have been visible to onlookers, creating a connection between living and dead.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=86&amp;ndash;87}}

Following the cremation, the ashes and remains would have been collected and placed within an urn.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=87}}{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=116}} It is not known how long the urn was kept before being buried; it is "very possible" that in certain cases they were stored above ground for "long periods of time".{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=87}} When buried, the urns were most often placed upright, although in a few rare examples they were instead inverted.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=116}}  At times they were buried individually, each in their own pit, although in other cases, several urns were clustered together in a burial pit.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=117}}

====Burial urns and grave goods====
Anglo-Saxon burial urns were typically hand-made out of [[pottery]], and often decorated with various motifs. These included bosses, stamps and linear incised marks, as well as freehand designs.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}} The most notable of these motifs was the [[swastika]], which was widely inscribed not only on crematory urns but also on certain pieces of weaponry, various brooches and other forms of (often female) jewellery. Archaeologist [[David M. Wilson|David Wilson]] remarked that the swastika "undoubtedly had special importance", suggesting that it was the symbol of the pagan god [[Thunor]]. He accepted that through increasing usage, it might have become a "purely decorative device with no real symbolic importance."{{sfn|Wilson|1992|pp=115, 118–119}} Another symbol that appears on urns and other artefacts is the [[rune]] {{runic|ᛏ}}; this represented the letter T and has been associated with the god [[Týr|Tiw]].{{sfn|Wilson|1992|pp=116&amp;ndash;117}}

[[File:Snape urn.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Funerary urn from the [[Snape Anglo-Saxon Cemetery]].]]
In rare cases, such as at [[Baston]], [[Lincolnshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#May76|Mayes and Dean 1976]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drayton, Norfolk|Drayton]], [[Norfolk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi01|Smith 1901]]. pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; lids were made for these urns; the most elaborate known example &amp;ndash; from [[Spong Hill]], Norfolk &amp;ndash; is decorated with a seated human figure with its head in its hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hil87|Hills, Penn and Rickett. 1987]]. pp. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples used stones as lids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luc00|Lucy 2000]]. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of cases where "window urns" have been uncovered, containing pieces of glass inserted into the fabric of the pottery.&lt;ref name="Lucy 2000. p. 115"/&gt; Examples of this have been found at such sites as [[Castle Acre]] in [[Norfolk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea64|Meaney 1964]]. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helpston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea64|Meaney 1964]]. pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Haslington]] in [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Let38|Lethbridge 1938]]. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a few rare cases, such as at Cleatham in [[Lincolnshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fie89|Field 1989]]. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; where instead of making a new pot to bury cremated remains in, Anglo-Saxon peoples re-used older Late Romano-British period urns or pots in their funerary rites.&lt;ref name="Lucy 2000. p. 115"&gt;[[#Luc00|Lucy 2000]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, pottery urns were substituted by bronze bowls,{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=115}} with examples being found at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk,&lt;ref name="Lucy 2000. p. 115"/&gt; at [[Coombe, Kent|Coombe]] in [[Kent]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ell67|Ellis Davidson and Webster 1967]].&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Illington]] in Norfolk,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cla57|Clarke 1957]]. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wes73|West and Owles 1973]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like inhumations, cremated remains were sometimes deposited along with grave goods, however sites containing grave goods constitute only "about half of the known cremations".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=275}} Sometimes, these items were placed on the cremation pyre along with the corpse, and were therefore damaged by the fire. They were then placed, along with the skeletal remains, within an urn for burial. At other times, these grave goods were placed inside the urn unburnt, meaning that they remained intact and undamaged.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|pp=108&amp;ndash;109}} The most common grave goods placed in cremation graves were "toilet implements", among them bronze and iron tweezers, razors and blades, shears and ear-scoops; some were full-sized, but others were miniatures of no practical use.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=93}} Also common were bone and antler combs, some of which had been deliberately broken prior to inclusion.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=93}}

==Burial places==

===Cemeteries===
Archaeologists know of the existence of around 1,200 Anglo-Saxon cemeteries across England.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 276"&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological investigation has displayed that structures or buildings were built inside a number of pagan cemeteries, and as [[David M. Wilson|David Wilson]] noted, "The evidence, then, from cemetery excavations is suggestive of small structures and features, some of which may perhaps be interpreted as shrines or sacred areas".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, there is evidence of far smaller structures being built around or alongside individual graves, implying possible small shrines to the dead individual or individuals buried there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; At the cemetery of Apple Down in [[Sussex]], four-post structures were discovered, mostly situated over cremations, and the excavators Down and Welch theorised that these were the remains of small, roofed huts that contained the cremated deposits of a single family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dow90|Down and Welch 1990]]. pp. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrow burials===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon burial mounds}}
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound cleaned.jpg|right|thumb|''Mound 2'' is the only Sutton Hoo [[tumulus]] to have been reconstructed to its supposed original height.]]
In the late sixth century, well over a century after the Anglo-Saxon peoples had become dominant in eastern Britain, they adopted a new burial practice for the deceased members of the wealthy social elite: their burial in [[tumuli]], which are also known as barrows or burial mounds.

This practice had been adopted by the members of the [[Merovingian dynasty]] who ruled the [[Franks]] in Francia (modern France) during the fifth century. During the sixth century, they had gained increasing influence over the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Kent]], eventually leading to a marriage alliance between the two. The Kentish elites subsequently adopted the practice of tumuli burial, and from here it spread north of the Thames, being adopted by the elites in other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some of the Anglo-Saxons may have adopted the practice from native Britons.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 277"&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, barrows had been constructed for burial in Britain during the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] periods prior to the Anglo-Saxon arrival. In many cases, Anglo-Saxons reused these earlier monuments rather than constructing their own.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 277"/&gt; Barrow burials continued to be practiced by the Anglo-Saxons throughout the seventh century, but had effectively died out by the eighth.

===Ship burials===
[[File:Sutton Hoo ship-burial model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the ship burial at Mound One, Sutton Hoo.]]
Another form of burial was that of [[ship burial]]s, which were practiced by many of the Germanic peoples across northern Europe. In many cases it seems that the corpse was placed within a ship that was then either sent out to sea or left on land, but in both cases then set alight. In [[Suffolk]] however, ships were not burned, but buried, as is the case at Sutton Hoo, which it is believed, was the resting place of the king of the East Angles, [[Raedwald]].&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991. p. 277"/&gt; Both ship and tumulus burials were described in the ''Beowulf'' poem, through the funerals of [[Scyld Scefing]] and [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] respectively.

==Grave goods==
Both pagan and Christian Anglo-Saxons buried their dead with [[grave goods]]. Amongst the earlier Anglo-Saxons who adhered to pagan beliefs, such goods accompanied both inhumed and cremated remains.

In some cases, animal skulls, particularly oxen but also pig, were buried in human graves, a practice also found in Roman Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=274}}

Howard WIlliams argued that grave goods carried mnemonic significance in Early Medieval society.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=36}}Williams has also explored the significance of death, cremation and grooming implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.6.7 | issue=42 | title=Tressed for Death in Early Anglo-Saxon England | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Williams | first1 = Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grave goods can inform archaeologists about cultural connections and trade; for instance, at Buckland cemetery near Dover, Kent, over half of the brooches buried as grave goods were imports from continental Europe, illustrating the connections between the Kingdom of Kent and the Frankish area.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|pp=136&amp;ndash;137}}

==Middle Anglo-Saxon period==

The Middle Anglo-Saxon period is a term applied to the years between circa 600 and 800 CE.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=83}} The burial practices of this period have been described as being less well understood than those of either the Early or Late Anglo-Saxon period.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=83}} The first individual to recognise a cemetery as having dated from this period was the late 18th century antiquarian [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]]; in examining the grave goods found in Kentish barrow cemeteries, he noted the presence of Christian motifs on certain artefacts, thereby concluding that this cemetery contained the burials of those Anglo-Saxons who had converted to Christianity but who lived before the emergence of widespread churchyard burial.{{sfn|Geake|1992|pp=83&amp;ndash;84}} Further Middle Anglo-Saxon cemeteries were identified by the archaeologist [[T. C. Lethbridge]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] during the 1920s and 1930s, who noted that they lacked the 'pagan' elements, such as weapon burials, which were associated with earlier cemeteries; he thus assumed that those inhumed at the site were early Anglo-Saxon Christians.{{sfnm|1a1=Boddington|1y=1990|1pp=178, 179&amp;ndash;180|2a1=Geake|2y=1992|2p=84}}

The archaeologist Helen Geake noted that the burials of this period could be analytically divided into four groups: furnished, unfurnished, princely, and deviant.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=89}} Some cemeteries contain only one form of burial, but others combine different forms; the prominent Middle Anglo-Saxon cemetery at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]] for instance contained three types of burial.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=89}}

The documented [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|conversion of Anglo-Saxon England to Christianity]], which took place during the seventh century, was used by earlier archaeologists to explain many of the changes in burial practices during this period.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=89}} For instance, the gradual decline in the appearance of grave goods and the increasing use of inhumed bodies located in a west-to-east orientation have been attributed to Christian beliefs about the afterlife.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=89}}

===Final Phase burials===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="[T]he model may be synthesized into three major components. Firstly, ''suppression'': burial with grave-goods was gradually squeezed out. Secondly, ''separation'': the Final Phase burial grounds are a discrete group of cemeteries. Thirdly, ''succession'': the cemeteries replace a nearby predecessor. For these three components of the model the causation, the motivating force for change, is Christianity."|source=— Andy Boddington, 1990.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=182}} }}

Cemeteries of this period have sometimes been referred to as "Final Phase", a term coined for them by the archaeologist [[Edward Thurlow Leeds]] in 1936.{{sfnm|1a1=Boddington|1y=1990|1p=179|2a1=Geake|2y=1992|2p=84}} He viewed such cemeteries as the last manifestation of the pagan way of life, before it was supplanted by Christianity with its unfurnished burial practices.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=84}} In 1963, the archaeologist Miranda Hyslop analysed the excavated burials up to that date, and assembled a list of attributes which she believed defined Final Phase burials.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=180}} The furnished burials of the "Final Phase" are typical of 7th and early-8th century cemeteries.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=84}} However, the manner in which archaeologists have assigned burials as "Final Phase" has been uneven, and thus there is no clear corpus of agreed upon examples.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=178}}

Boddington summarised the characteristics of Final Phase burials as a series of eight points.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} First, it involved a new set of cemeteries being established under the influence of Christianity.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} Second, these cemeteries were often located close to settlements, in contrast to their Early Anglo-Saxon counterparts.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} Third, the burials are almost entirely inhumations,{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} with very few cremation burials having been found from this period.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}}
Fourth, these inhumations tend to be oriented on a west-to-east direction.{{sfnm|1a1=Boddington|1y=1990|1pp=178, 181|2a1=Geake|2y=1992|2p=85}} Fifth, some of the graves are located in, or under, barrows.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} Sixth, there is a high proportion of graves with few or no grave goods.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} Seventh, those items that are featured are predominantly relating to utilitarian clothing or represent small personal tokens.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}} The final point is that some of the grave goods, notable the cross forms, have Christian symbolic significance.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=181}}

[[File:Saxon Princess Kirkleatham.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Replica of the "Saxon Princess" bed burial at the [[Street House Anglo-Saxon cemetery]]]]

In addition, Geake noted that the bodies are generally supine, being either extended or slightly flexed, while the arms are typically at the sides of the body or folded across it.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} There is nevertheless variation in the use of structures within and around the graves, which include beds or chambers inside the grave, as well as mounds, postholes or boat parts outside of it.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}}

Burials reflecting this Final Phase exhibit an increasing polarity of grave wealth.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} While most Final Phase burials contain grave goods, there are fewer artefacts interned with the graves than was seen in the Early Anglo-Saxon period.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=84}} The artefacts included as grave goods also differ from those typically found in earlier centuries.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} Brooches and long strings of beads become less common in female graves, while weapons become less common in male graves.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} Men's graves often include small buckles, knives, and sometimes shoelace tags.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} Women's graves typically consist of pins, chatelaines with such accessories as purse-mounts and workboxes, and necklaces containing small, monochrome beads, gold pendants, and slip-rings made of silver or bronze.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}}

The decline in grave goods has sometimes been attributed to suppression of this practice by the ecclesiastical Christian authorities.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=188}} However this explanation has often been challenged, in part because there are no surviving canons or laws from this period that condemn the practice of burying the dead with grave goods; rather, contemporary ecclesiastical documents display little interest in how the dead are buried.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=188}} Moreover, there is no clear termination of the use of grave goods but rather a gradual decline in the practice, whereas any ecclesiastical prohibition might have been expected to result in an immediate end to the practice.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=188}} An alternative explanation for the decline in grave goods is that the Middle Anglo-Saxon period could have witnessed a change in the structure of inheritance; for instance, whereas weapons were previously inhumed along with their owner, there could have been an increasing emphasis on such items being inherited by the deceased's kin.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=189}} A third explanation could be found in a growing desire to conserve limited resources and keep them within circulation, rather than removing them from social usage through burial with the dead. This could in turn be linked to the expansion of trade systems and the establishment of trading sites such as [[Ipswich]] at which items could be more easily exchanged.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=189}}

The spatial patterning of grave good types also differs from those of the Early Anglo-Saxon period, as smaller regional distributions were replaced by larger ones.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=92}} This might reflect that the people of Anglo-Saxon England were beginning to increasingly recognise themselves as members of a larger cultural group, the English, as opposed to their earlier more geographically restricted cultural groupings.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=92}}

===Princely burials===

A different form of burial found in Middle Anglo-Saxon England is termed the "Rich Burial" or "Princely Burial" by archaeologists.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} These are characterised by having a large number and high quality of their grave goods, and are often also found beneath a barrow mound or tumulus.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}} However, there is no precise agreed upon definition among Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists regarding the criteria for characterising a burial as a princely burial or not.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=86}} In various respects &amp;ndash; such as the orientation and position of the inhumed body and the variety of structures within or around the grave &amp;ndash; these princely burials are similar to the wider array of contemporary Final Phase furnished burials.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=85}}

===Unfurnished burials===

A number of cemeteries dating from the seventh and eighth centuries which contain a majority of unfurnished burials.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=86}} The bodies within these inhumations are often laid out supine in a roughly east to west alignment.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=86}}
Such burials have been found in both rural contexts, as at Burrow Hill, Burgh Castle, and Nazeing, as well as in urban contexts such as Staple Green, Winchester and Castle Green, Hereford.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=86}}

The practice of unfurnished burial might have been adopted from other areas of the British Isles who already had such traditions in place, such as Ireland or Northumbria.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=90}}

===Deviant burials and execution cemeteries===

These burials typically have either very few or no grave goods.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=87}} In some instances, for instance at Sutton Hoo and Cuddeston, these burials have been made around a barrow.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=87}}

==Late Anglo-Saxon period==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="A man may bury his brother with the dead&lt;br&gt;And strew his grave with the golden things&lt;br&gt;He would have him take, treasures of all kinds,&lt;br&gt;But gold hoarded when he here lived&lt;br&gt;Cannot allay the anger of God&lt;br&gt;Toward a soul sin-freighted."|source=— A passage in [[Old English]] poem ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'' reflecting Late Anglo-Saxon views on earlier furnished burial.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=177}} }}

In nearby [[Francia]], [[Charlemagne]]'s ordinances of parish rights &amp;ndash; issued in 786 and 810/3 &amp;ndash; prohibited the continuing use of earlier, non-Christian cemeteries, emphasising the need for churchyard burial. This formal ruling may have confirmed attitudes that were already held by the Anglo-Saxon Church.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=168}}

The archaeologist Andy Boddington stated that the transition from the highly furnished graves of the Early Anglo-Saxon period to their unfurnished counterparts on the Late Anglo-Saxon period represented "one of the most dramatic archaeological statements" of the early medieval.{{sfn|Boddington|1990|p=177}}

After 900, a churchyard consecration rite was developed.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=168}} The burial of an individual in the parish to which they belonged was considered mandatory.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=169}} The only individuals excluded from burial in the churchyard were unrepentant perjurers and those who had committed suicide yet were not deemed mad.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=169}} The enclosure of churchyards was a development of the tenth and eleventh centuries.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=169}} Clergy increasingly developed a financial interest in having individuals buried within their churchyard, because they would receive a fee for both the burial and masses to be performed for the dead.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=169}}

Christian teaching held as a basic tenet the belief that after bodily death the human soul would be judged according to their behaviour in life. Those who had been baptised, kept faith, performed good deeds, and had intercessory prayer could be permitted to [[Heaven]], while those who did not do such things would go on an afterlife of torment in [[Hell]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=170}}
Texts from this period reflect that there was a division of opinion about the clergy as to whether judgement followed immediately on from death or whether all deceased soul awaited [[Judgement Day]] before being sent to either Heaven or Hell.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=170}} The concept of [[Purgatory]], an intermediate zone between Heaven and Hell, had yet to be developed.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=171}}

By the eighth century, burial in clothing had largely disappeared, with the exception of clerics.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=174}} Instead, the majority were buried in a white shroud that was wrapped around the body, in this manner emulating the description of the burial of [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Gospels]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=174}}

The use of coffins was practical when a body had to be transported some distance prior to its burial.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=176}} Typically made of wood, in a number of excavated cases &amp;ndash; for instance at [[York Minster]] &amp;ndash; they also included metal fittings and locks.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=176}}
These wooden coffins rarely survive in the archaeological record, however a number of examples were preserved due to waterlogged conditions at [[Barton on Humber]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=176}}
In a minority of cases, coffins were made not of wood but of lead or stone, the latter being used in particular for important clerics.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=176}}

===Graveyards===

The orderly burial of inhumations oriented in a west to east direction with no intercutting was the normal pattern for graveyard burial.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=174}}

===Grave markers===

A tradition emerged of marking important graves, particularly ecclesiastical ones.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=173}} Such markers included slabs that laid flat over the grave, and large crosses that stood upright, a number of which still survive in place.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=173}} Surviving marker stones have shown that a number of regional styles existed.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=173}} In Eastern England, a Scandinavian artistic influence is apparent on many of them.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=173}}

In the areas of Scandinavian settlement in the northeast of England, [[hogback (sculpture)|hogback]] tombs were created.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|pp=173&amp;ndash;174}}
Scandinavian settlement also resulted in the return of furnished burials under barrows in several instances, for instance at [[Ingleby, Derbyshire|Ingleby]] in Derbyshire.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=174}}

===Saints' burials===
Bede offers a description of the burial of [[St Cuthbert]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|pp=189&amp;ndash;181}} This account has been described as being "an extreme case" but not "untypical of those considered sanctified".{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=180}}

==Discovery and excavation==

===Antiquarian investigation===
The earliest record of post-Anglo-Saxon people excavating an early Anglo-Saxon burial comes from the 12th century, when [[Roger of Wendover]] described how several monks dug up the burial mounds at [[Redbourne]], [[Hertfordshire]], in search of the bones of [[Amphibalus|Saint Amphibalus]], a Roman period priest.{{Sfn|Meaney|1964|pp=104&amp;ndash;105}} A later documented case occurred in the 17th century, when Sir Thomas Browne published a pamphlet entitled ''Hydrotaphia, Urn Buriall'' (1658), in which he described a number of cremation urns found in Norfolk; although they had been Anglo-Saxon in origin, he mistook them for being Romano-British. Describing these finds, Browne related that "In a Field of old Walsingham not many months past were digged up between forty and fifty urns, deposited in a dry and sandy soil, not a yard deep, not far from one another... some containing two pounds of bones, distinguishable in skulls, ribs, jaws, thigh-bones, and teeth, with fresh impressions of their combustion".{{sfn|Browne|1966 (1658)|p=10}}

Despite these earlier excavations, archaeologist Sam Lucy remarked that "the accolade of being the first excavators of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries should really go to two Kentish gentlemen clerics."{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=6}} The first was the [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] Reverend Bryan Faussett. Between 1759 and 1773 he excavated at a number of cemeteries in Kent; Gilton, Kingstone Down, Chartham Down and [[Sibertswold]]. Uncovering about 750 graves, he made detailed records in his field notebooks noting anatomical details, but like Browne before him, he mistakenly attributed them to Roman-Britain. Following his death in 1776, Faussett's notes were written up and published in 1856 as the ''Inventorium Sepulchrale'' by Charles Roach Smith, who added his own commentary to the work.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=6}}

The second of these antiquarian Kentish clerics was [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], who excavated at such sites as [[Great Lines Heritage Park|Chatham Lines]] and [[Greenwich Park]] from 1779 to 1793. He published his findings in a book entitled ''Nenia Brittanica'' (1793). Douglas was the first to identify burials of this type as being Anglo-Saxon rather than Romano-British, coming to this conclusion because of "Their situation near villages of [Anglo-]Saxon names" and the fact that "They are scattered all over Britain in places which the [Anglo-]Saxons occupied, and are not discovered in the parts of Wales which they had not subdued."{{sfn|Douglas|1793|p=177}}

===Archaeological investigation===
Although some antiquarians had made attempts to excavate and catalogue the Anglo-Saxon grave-sites, on the whole, such sites were commonly damaged and destroyed in eighteenth and early nineteenth century England, with little attempt being made to properly study them. Due to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]' inability to act on the situation, in 1843 [[Charles Roach Smith]] and Thomas Wright &amp;ndash; both keen Anglo-Saxonists &amp;ndash; founded the [[British Archaeological Association]] (BAA), which held its first conference the following year in [[Canterbury]].{{sfn|Rhodes|1990|pp=32–33}} The BAA's leadership campaigned for better rights for native British archaeology, asking for it to be protected legally and to be recognised by major institutions. When the [[British Museum]] refused to purchase Faussett's collection of Anglo-Saxon artefacts following his grandson's death in 1853, Roach Smith complained that "not only does the Government begin with gathering the monuments, ancient and modern, of all foreign countries, but it ends there also. Our national antiquities are not even made subservient and placed in the lowest grade; they are altogether unrecognised and ignored."&lt;ref&gt;Roach Smith, in [[#Fau56|Faussett 1856]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The bushranger ban''' refers to a ban on films about [[bushrangers]] that came in effect in Australia in 1911-12. Films about bushrangers had been the most popular genre of local films ever since ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906). Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in [[South Australia]] (1911), [[New South Wales]] (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley &amp; Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 53&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1912).&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/film-in-australia "Films in Australia", ''Australia.gov.au''] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15376293 |title=THE CENSOR. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 November 1912 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534055850.html Philippa Hawker, "Cinema's anti-hero rides again", ''The Age'', 29 January 2003] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/chronology/1910s/ Australian film and television chronology] at [[Australian Screen Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/feature-articles/oz_western/ More Australian than Aristotelian: The Australian Bushranger Film, 1904-1914by William D.

The Hollywood bushranging film ''[[Stingaree (1934 film)|Stingaree]]'' (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96373244 |title="OUT!"

The bushranger genre of Australian film fictionalized the experiences of [[Bushranger|bushrangers]] from Australian history. Bushrangers were outlaws, most active in the 19th century, and remembered in Australian folklore for their acts of robbery and violent crime, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/bushrangers-nsw|title=Bushrangers in NSW|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre showed how the bushrangers’ intimate connection with the bush allowed them to skirt the law and engage in outlaw activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheckels|first=Theodore F.|date=June 1998|title="New Wave" Cinema's Redefinition of Australian Heroism|url=|journal=Antipodes|volume=12|pages=29-36|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the films made before the ban glorified bushrangers, rather than making them seem criminal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bushranger films include ''[[Bushranging in North Queensland|Bushranging in Northern Queensland]]'' and ''Robbery of a Mail Coach by Bushrangers.'' Both were released in 1904 and ran five minutes long and six minutes long respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757462033|title=Australian horror films, 1973-2010|last=1962-|first=Shelley, Peter,|date=2012|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=9780786461677|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=757462033}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', about the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]], was released in [[Melbourne]] on December 26, 1906.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' is notable for being the first feature film ever made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time of its release, it was considered to be the longest film that had ever been made, running at around seventy to eighty minutes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/bushrangers|title=National Museum of Australia - Bushrangers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nma.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the majority of the bushranger films that would follow it, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was relatively sympathetic to the outlaws whose lives it fictionalized. As a result, the government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] tried to censor it when it was first released, claiming that it was encouraging crime. It was banned in two towns that had a relation to the gang presented in the movie.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite government discontent, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was a major commercial success, both nationally and internationally. One of the producers of the film stated that it made 25,000 pounds, in comparison to its budget of 1000 pounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Bushranger films from 1906 to 1912 ==
[[File:Mad Dog Morgan.jpg|thumb|252x252px|Wood carving of the bushranger Dan "Mad Dog" Morgan]]
The success of ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' encouraged filmmakers to produce even more bushranger films.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/587198895|title=Australia &amp; New Zealand|date=2010|publisher=Intellect Books|others=Goldsmith, Ben, 1967-, Lealand, Geoffrey.|isbn=9781841503738|location=Bristol, UK|oclc=587198895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1900 and 1914, one hundred and sixteen bushranger films were made in Australia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910448038|title=Censorship : a World Encyclopedia.|last=Stockbridge|first=Sally L.|date=2015|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781136798641|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Derek|location=Hoboken|pages=|chapter="Australia: Film and Video"|oclc=910448038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, of these films focused on the lives of white male bushrangers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435778744|title=The A to Z of Australian and New Zealand cinema|last=Albert.|first=Moran,|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|others=Vieth, Errol, 1950-, Moran, Albert.|isbn=9780810863477|location=Lanham|oclc=435778744}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most significant bushranger films made in this period include ''[[Thunderbolt (1910 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (1910), ''[[Captain Midnight, the Bush King]]'' (1911), multiple adaptations of the classic bushranger novel ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'', and ''[[Dan Morgan (film)|Dan Morgan]]'' (1911). ''Dan Morgan'' was notable for depicting its protagonist, the historical outlaw [[Dan Morgan (bushranger)|Dan Morgan]], as a true criminal, rather than an anti-hero.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic violence of ''Dan Morgan'' was unlike the content of any bushranger film before it, and it spurred the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to pass regulations on film content the very next year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 ==
In 1912, New South Wales’s Theatres and Public Halls Act was amended to directly target the content of films. Specifically, the 1912 amendment was meant to prohibit the screening of “objectionable” films – films with&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/117688374?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Censoring Films: Regulations Gazetted.|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1912|work=Evening News|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“scenes suggestive of immorality or indecency, executions, murders, or other revolting scenes; scenes of debauchery, low habits of life, or other scenes such as would have a demoralizing effect on young person; successful crime, such as bushranging, robberies, or other acts of lawlessness…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The New South Wales government claimed that the Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 was meant to protect film audiences, particularly young audiences, from “injurious influence.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This included the criminal activity of bushrangers. They were also against most bushranger films' depiction of the police as an antagonistic force.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anyone going against the Act could be subject to a fine of up to 20 pounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The police were placed in charge of censoring films in accordance with the standards set by the 1912 amendment. They were to look over film summaries in order to determine their appropriateness, and could also demand a screening of a film if they thought it contained any “objectionable” material.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Censorship of film imports and exports ==
In 1917, state censor boards were supplemented by a national Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. The national Censorship Board judged the content of imported films, primarily those from Britain and the USA. State censor boards could take additional action if they believed that the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board had acted too leniently.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1920, the Chief Secretary of Victoria attempted to prevent the development of a film about the [[Kelly Gang]] that he believed would spread a negative image of Victoria. The Australian government feared that attempts to ban the film in Australia would result in its international distribution. The government worried that the international release of any films that portrayed Australia negatively would damage the country’s global image. Though the government could not intervene in the creation of a film, it could control its distribution. That year, the Minister of Customs was placed in charge of regulating the export of films from Australia to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127388446?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Export of Films: Why Prohibition Was Applied.|last=|first=|date=January 3, 1920|work=The Maitland Weekly Mercury|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the ban on Australian film ==
Before the bushranger ban, bushranging had been the most common topic for Australian films. After the ban, film production in Australia decreased as creators lost their most popular genre and the audiences it drew to the theatres.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Unsurprisingly, the new censorship forces were met with discontent from the Australian film industry. H.M. Hawkins, the managing director of [[Spencer's Pictures|Spencer’s Pictures]], argued that censorship would limit the industry’s ability grow, since depictions of crime were essential to the creation of a successful drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228833817?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship "Will Cripple the Picture Business"|last=|first=|date=November 17, 1912|work=The Sun|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 1916, a week after a violent film about gambling was prevented from being screened, a group of Australian film exhibitors gathered to discuss the impact of censorship on their business.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121345461?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship: Exhibitors Meet To-Day|last=|first=|date=December 17, 1916|work=Sunday Times|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expressed frustration with the fact that the police were in charge of film censors, claiming that the police department was most threatened by bushranger films' depictions of crime and as a result was hardest on crime in film over all other content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They also pointed out that films were being censored far more harshly than written material with the same content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary threat the New South Wales government saw in bushranger films was their apparent glorification of crime. As a result, some bushranger films could get through the censors if the criminal activity they depicted was condemned within the film and law enforcement wasn’t shown in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, because of the stigma that had developed around the genre, few directors were willing to risk making bushranger films, especially if they had established reputations to uphold. In 1920, the director [[Raymond Longford]] avoided adapting ''Robbery Under Arms'' in order to preserve his status within the Australian film industry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Decline of the bushranger ban ==

The end of the bushranger ban was arguably indicated by the 1942 release of ''[[When the Kellys Rode]]'' in New South Wales. ''When the Kellys Rode'', a bushranger film about the Kelly Gang, had been banned in 1934. It was the last film banned under the Theatres and Public Halls Act for bushranging content.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18077432?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Film Banned in N.S.W.: 'Brighton Rock'|last=|first=|date=July 10, 1948|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Baddeley]], Chief Secretary of New South Wales, finally allowed it to screen in New South Wales in the midst of [[World War II]], claiming that the crimes that the film depicted were nothing compared to “the unbridled horrors of war.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/205278235?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Ban on Kelly Gang Film Removed|last=|first=|date=January 7, 1942|work=The Age|access-date=|location=Melbourne, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''When the Kellys Rode'', the Theatres and Public Halls Act was invoked again by Chief Secretary Baddeley to ban the violent British film ''[[Brighton Rock (1948 film)|Brighton Rock]]''. ''Brighton Rock'' had been allowed into Australia by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Appeals Board, and the Chief Secretary would state no reason for the decision to ban the film in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

By the time that bushranger ban was finally lifted in the 1940s, the popularity of and demand for the genre had already faded.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Even after bushranging in film was legal, at least one attempt to produce a bushranger film was met with discontent from Australian citizens. In 1947, residents of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]], a town associated with the Kelly Gang, protested against [[Harry Southwell]]’s plans to shoot a film about Ned Kelly in their town. Glenrowan’s farmers sent a petition to Parliament to ban the film, claiming that bushranger films had given a negative reputation to the descendants of the Kelly Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/161306059?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Ned Kelly Revival: Bitter Opposition to Film|last=|first=|date=August 16, 1947|work=National Advocate|access-date=|location=Bathurst, New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Edward Faxon00a.jpg|thumb]]
'''Charles Edward Faxon''' (January 21, 1846 – February 6, 1918) was an American [[botanical artist]] and instructor of [[botany]] born in [[Jamaica Plain]], [[Massachusetts]].

In 1867 he received his degree in [[civil engineering]] from [[Lawrence Scientific School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. From 1879 to 1884, he taught classes in botany at the [[Bussey Institute]].

Faxon was knowledgeable in regards to the flora of [[New England]], and in 1882 joined the staff at the [[Arnold Arboretum]]. Here he took charge of development of the [[herbarium]] and [[library]]. He worked closely with [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] (1841-1927), the director of the [[arboretum]].

== Publications ==
Faxon created 744 plates for illustration of Sargent's "Silva of North America". In addition to these drawings, he provided the illustrative work for the following publications by Sargent:
* "Manual of the Trees of North America (exclusive of Mexico)", (664 illustrations). 
* "Garden and Forest", (285 illustrations).
* "Forest Flora of Japan", (1894).
* "Trees and Shrubs: Illustrations of New Or Little Known Ligneous Plants", (1902–13).

'''''Charles of Bourbon Visiting [[St Peter's Basilica]]''''' is a painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]], commissioned by its subject [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]] in 1746 and completed later that year. It was part of the same commission as the same artist's ''[[Charles of Bourbon Visiting Pope Benedict XIV at the Coffee House del Quirinale]]'' and both works are now in the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]] in Naples.

[[File:Pincushion distortion.svg|thumb|right|Curvilinear pincushion distortion]]'''Curvilinear perspective''' is a [[graphical projection]] used to draw 3D objects on 2D surfaces. It was formally codified in 1968 by the artists and art historians André Barre and Albert Flocon in the book ''La Perspective curviligne'',&lt;ref name="Français"&gt;Albert Flocon and André Barre, ''La Perspective curviligne'', Flammarion, Éditeur, Paris, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated into English in 1987 as ''Curvilinear Perspective: From Visual Space to the Constructed Image'' and published by the [[University of California Press]].&lt;ref name=Anglais&gt;Albert Flocon and André Barre, ''CurvilinearPerspective: From Visual Space to the Constructed Image'', (Robert Hansen, translator), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1987 {{ISBN|0-520-05979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Earlier, less mathematically precise versions can be seen in the work of the miniaturist [[Jean Fouquet]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in a lost notebook spoke of curved perspective lines.&lt;ref name=Anglais/&gt;

Examples of approximated five-point perspective can also be found in the self-portrait of the [[Mannerism|mannerist]] painter [[Parmigianino]] seen through a [[shaving mirror]]. Another example would be the curved mirror in ''Arnolfini's Wedding'' by the Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]].

The book ''Vanishing Point: Perspective for Comics from the Ground Up'' by Jason Cheeseman-Meyer teaches five and four (infinite) point perspective.

In 1959, Flocon had acquired a copy of ''Grafiek en tekeningen'' by [[M. C. Escher]] who strongly impressed him with his use of bent and curved perspective, which influenced the theory Flocon and Barre were developing. They started a long correspondence, in which Escher called Flocon a "kindred spirit".&lt;ref name=Anglais/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

== Horizon and vanishing points ==
{{multiple image|align=center
| footer = A comparison of the same object displayed, on the left using a '''curvilinear''' perspective and on the right, using a  [[vanishing point]]
| image1 = Curviligne.svg|width1=230
| image2 = VanishingPerspective.svg|width2=300
}}
[[File:Panotools5618.jpg|thumb|250px|Curvilinearity in photography: Curvilinear (above) and [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] (below) image. Notice the [[barrel distortion]] typical for [[fisheye lens]]es in the curvilinear image. While this example has been rectilinear-corrected by software, high quality [[wide-angle lens]]es are built with optical rectilinear correction.]]The system uses curving perspective lines instead of [[Rectilinear grid|straight converging ones]] to approximate the image on the retina of the eye, which is itself spherical, more accurately than the traditional [[linear perspective]], which uses straight lines and gets very strangely distorted at the edges.

It uses either four, five  or more [[vanishing point]]s:

*In five-point ([[Fisheye lens|fisheye]]) perspective: Four vanishing points are placed around in a circle, they are named N, W, S, E, plus one vanishing point in the center of the circle.
*Four, or infinite-point perspective is the one that (arguably) most approximates the perspective of the human eye, while at the same time being effective for making impossible spaces, while five point is the curvilinear equivalent of one point perspective, so is  four point the equivalent of two point perspective.

This technique can, like two-point perspective, use a vertical line as a horizon line, creating both a worms and birds eye view at the same time. It uses four or more points equally spaced along a horizon line, all vertical lines are made perpendicular to the horizon line, while orthogonals are created using a compass set on a line made at a 90-degree angle through each of the four vanishing points.

==Geometric relationship==
{{multiple image|align=center
| footer = '''''Figure 1''''' shows the wall ''1'' and the observer ''2'' from the upper projection
| image1 = Ściana.png
| width1 = 500
}}
Distances '''''a''''' and '''''c''''' between the viewer and the wall are greater than the '''''b''''' distance, so adopting the principle that when an object is a greater distance from the observer, it becomes smaller, the wall is reduced and thus appears distorted at the edges.

{{multiple image|align=center
| footer = '''''Figure 2''''' shows the same situation from the observer's view point.
| image1 = Ściana2.png
| width1 = 500
}}

==Mathematics==

If a point has the 3D [[Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'',''y'',''z''):

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{3D}= (x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting distance from the point to the origin by ''d'' = {{sqrt|''x''{{sup|2}} + ''y''{{sup|2}} + ''z''{{sup|2}}}},

then the transformation of the point to a curvilinear reference system of radius ''R'' is

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{2D} = \left(\frac{xR}{d}, \frac{yR}{d}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 
(if ''d'' = 0, then the point is at the origin, which means its projection is undefined)

This is derived by first projecting the 3D point onto a sphere with radius ''R'' that centers on the origin, so that we obtain an image of the point that has coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{sphere} = (x, y, z) * \left(\frac{R}{d}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we do a parallel projection that is parallel with the ''z''-axis to project the point on the sphere onto the paper at ''z'' = ''R'', thus obtaining

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{image} = \left(\frac{xR}{d}, \frac{yR}{d}, R\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are not concerned with the fact that the paper is resting on the ''z'' = ''R'' plane, we ignore the ''z''-coordinate of the image point, thus obtaining

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{2D} = \left(\frac{xR}{d}, \frac{yR}{d}\right) = R * \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}, \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Since changing &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; only amounts to a scaling, it is usually defined to be unity, simplifying the formula further to:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{2D} = \left(\frac{x}{d}, \frac{y}{d}\right) = \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}, \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A line that does not pass through the origin is projected to a great circle on the sphere, which is further projected to an ellipse on the plane. The ellipse has the property that its long axis is a diameter of the "bounding circle".

'''''Earth''''' ({{lang-ua|Земля}}, [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;''Zemlya'') is a 1930 Soviet propaganda film by Ukrainian director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], concerning the process of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] and the hostility of [[Kulak]] landowners. It is Part 3 of Dovzhenko's "Ukraine Trilogy" (along with ''[[Zvenigora]]'' and ''[[Arsenal (1929 film)|Arsenal]]'').

''Earth'' is regarded as Dovzhenko's masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-06-07/entertainment/0206070320_1_andrei-tarkovsky-film-poet-farmers|title=`Earth' is a testament to Soviet Silent Cinema|last=Petrakis|first=John|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 7, 2002|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with the final moments of grandfather Semyon (Simon) Opanas beneath a pear tree.&lt;ref name=dovzhenko&gt;[http://rayuzwyshyn.net/dovzhenko/Earth.htm Philosophy, Iconology, Collectivization: ''Earth'' (1930)]&lt;/ref&gt; Next local [[kulaks]], including Arkhyp Bilokin, contemplate the process of [[collective farming|collectivization]] and declare their resistance to it, while elsewhere Semyon's grandson Vasyl (Basil) and his [[komsomol]] friends also meet to discuss collectivization, although his father is skeptical.

Later, Vasyl arrives with the community's first [[tractor]] to much excitement. After the men urinate in the overheated [[radiator]], the peasants plow the land with the tractor and harvest the grain. A montage sequence presents the production of bread from beginning to end. That night Vasyl dances a [[hopak]] along a path on his way home, but a dark figure attacks and kills him.

Vasyl's father turns away the priest who expects to lead the [[funeral]], declaring his [[atheism]]. He asks Vasyl's friends to bury his son in a new way without priests and "sing new songs for a new life." The villagers do so, while Vasyl's fiancee, Natalya, mourns him painfully and the local priest curses them as impious. At the cemetery, Bilokin's son Khoma (Thomas) arrives in a frenzy to declare that he will resist collectivization and that he was the one who killed Vasyl, but the villagers pay him no attention. One declares that Vasyl's glory will fly around the world like a new communist airplane. The film ends with a downpour of rain over fruit and vegetables.&lt;ref name=dovzhenko/&gt;

==Production==

===Background===
The political and historic events of ''Earth'' and the agricultural developments of Dovzhenko's home country Ukraine was a hot topic during the film's production and laid the foundation of the controversy that the film's release caused. In 1906 the Tzar had allowed peasants to own private land, which they then passed down through the generations. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, these peasants in Ukraine wanted to keep their family land and farms and the Soviet government tolerated them. After the grain shortages in the late 1920s, Joseph Stalin decided that it was necessary to eliminate "rural capitalism" in these regions and take control of the farming industry in 1929. Stalin stated "We must smash the Kulaks, eliminate them as a class."&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, Vance. ''In the Service of the State: The Cinema of Alexander Dovzhenko.'' London: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-299-10680-2}}. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the land-owning peasants fought back and began to sabotage agricultural machines. The local Kulaks were more militant and committed violent acts against Soviet officials. Most Ukrainians wanted to keep their private land, especially since compared to many other parts of Russia their land was agriculturally rich and fertile. In the middle of the political conflict surrounding this topic, Dovzhenko made a lyrical and poetic film depicting the lives of Ukrainian farmers that many Soviet officials considered completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing and production===
Dovzhenko wrote the original scenario for ''Earth'' in 1929 in response to the newfound collectivisation of small villages in Ukraine, which he described as "a period not only of economic transformation but also of mental transformation of the whole people."&lt;ref&gt;Dovzhenko, Alexander. ''Earth''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973. SBN 671-21393-8. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He based the character of Semyon on his own grandfather&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and the murder of Vasyl on the assassination of a Soviet agent by Kulaks in his own home district.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was Dovzhenko's first film with Kiev Studios after having impressed both critics and the Soviet government with his first two films. He once again used cinematographer and collaborator [[Danylo Demutsky]] on this film.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors, Volume 1''. The H. W. Wilson Company, 1987. p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Dovzhenko later adapted the film into a novelization and published the completed scenario in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dovzhenko, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukrainian and Russian, the title "Zemlia" translates to "earth" in the sense of soil, land or ground.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
===Initial===
''Earth'' received very positive reviews. ''Earth'' was simultaneously lauded and derided by Soviet authorities due to its fairly ambiguous political message on such a controversial political subject. It first premiered in [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine in the spring of 1930 during an event held to honor the local Dovzhenko. The film was an immense success and received a standing ovation.&lt;ref name="Kepley 75"&gt;Kepley, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only occasion during its initial release that ''Earth'' was praised and afterwards it was criticized by Soviet journalists. One critic called it "ideologically vicious" and some Communist Party officials accused Dovzhenko of wasting public funds on the film. ''[[Pravda]]'' praised the film's visual style but claimed it had a false political message. The official spokesman for the Red Army officially endorsed the film.&lt;ref name="Kepley 75"/&gt; Soviet communist artist [[Demyan Bedny]] called the film "counterrevolutionary" and "defeatist".&lt;ref name="Wakeman 263"&gt;Wakeman, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/kinohistoryofrus00jayl#page/275/mode/2up/|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]]|author=[[Jay Leyda]]|title= Kino: A History of the Russian and Soviet Film|year=1960|pages=275-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bedny was known as "The Kremlin Poet" and was also a personal friend of [[Joseph Stalin]]. He publicly criticized the film in the form of a satirical poem that appeared in ''Izvestia'' in which he stated that the film naively took a philosophical attitude towards political reality.&lt;ref name="Kepley 75"/&gt; The film was severely cut by the Soviet government. Dovzhenko was so upset by the negative reaction to the film that, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he left Ukraine and traveled throughout Europe screening his films&lt;ref name="Wakeman 263"/&gt; and experimenting with newly developed sound equipment available in western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[C. A. Lejeune]] praised the film's main section, saying that it "contains perhaps more understanding of pure beauty in cinema, more validity of relation in moving image, than any ten minutes of production yet known to the screen."&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Jacobs]] compared Dovzhenko's work to Eisenstein and Pudovkin, stating that Dovzhenko "had added a deep personal and poetic insight...[his films] are laconic in style, with a strange, wonderfully imaginative quality difficult to describe."&lt;ref name="Wakeman 263"/&gt; Film director [[Grigori Roshal]] praised the film, he wrote "Neither Eisenstein nor Pudovkin have achieved the tenderness and warmth in speaking about men and the world that Alexander Dovzhenko has revealed. Dovzhenko is always experimental. He is always an innovator and always a poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/experimentinfilm00unse#page/159/mode/2up|pages=159-160|publisher=The Grey Walls Press Ltd.|title=Experiment in the Film|editor=Roger Manvell|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was voted one of the twelve greatest films of all time by a group of 117 film historians at the 1958 [[Expo '58|Brussels World's Fair]] and named one of the top ten greatest films of all time by the International Film Critics Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lib.unc.edu/house/mrc/films/full.php?film_id=5592|title = MRC FilmFinder – Full Record: Earth| accessdate = 2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
''Earth'' is usually considered Dovzhenko's best film, and is often cited alongside [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) as one of the most important films of the Soviet era. Dovzhenko's biographer Marco Carynnyk lauded the film's "passionate simplicity...which has made it a masterpiece of world cinema" and praised its "powerful lyric affirmation of life."&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked #88 in the 1995 Centenary Poll of the 100 Best Films of the Century in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/timeoutD.html |title=Top 100 Films (Centenary) |website=filmsite.org access-date=8/25/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work also received 10 critics' votes in the 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of the world's greatest films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb8e7a6/sightandsoundpoll2012|title=Votes for ZEMLYA (1930)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Film Institute]] page for ''Earth'', it is noted that the plot "is secondary to the extraordinarily potent images of wheatfields, ripe fruit and weatherbeaten faces […] [[Terrence Malick]]’s [[Days of Heaven]] (1978) is in a similar [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsodic]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb8e7a6|title=ZEMLYA (1930)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Escape from Woomera''''' is an unfinished [[Point-and-click adventure game#Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure]] video game, intended to criticise the treatment of [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatorily detained asylum seekers in Australia]] as well as the Australian government's attempt to impose a media blackout on the detention centres. In the game, the player assumes the role of Mustafa, an Iranian asylum seeker being held at [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]]. Mustafa's request for asylum has been denied, and, fearing that he will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation to Iran, he decides to attempt to escape Woomera. Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan.

The game was developed in 2003 and 2004 by a team of Australian video game industry professionals and an [[investigative journalist]], using ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''{{'}}s [[GoldSrc]] engine. The developers received an AU $25,000 grant from the [[Australia Council for the Arts|Australia Council]] to make the game, propelling the project to national attention, where the idea received a predominantly negative reception. The Australia Council's decision to fund the game drew condemnation from both [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (Australia)|Minister for Immigration]] [[Philip Ruddock]] and [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] leader Dr. [[Seweryn Ozdowski|Sev Ozdowski]]. Without further funding, a full game was never developed, and the playable prototype was made available free of charge online.

==Plot==
[[File:Escape from Woomera 9.jpg|thumb|right|Mustafa speaks with a woman whose Quran was thrown to the ground by a guard, while detainees line up behind her to use a pay phone. In the upper left corner, the hope meter is shown.]]

''Escape from Woomera'' opens with three screens of text that explain the game's background. Players assume the role of Mustafa, who paid smugglers to bring him to Australia after his parents were killed by the Iranian secret police. After the boat transporting him crashed in the [[Ashmore Reef]], Mustafa was brought to the [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]], where he was given the identification number "RAR-124". After three months, Mustafa was informed that his request for asylum was denied, and that he would be repatriated to Iran. Believing that he would be tortured and killed upon his return, Mustafa decided to escape Woomera.&lt;ref name=CDF_174&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the game was never completed, only a small portion of the intended gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers.&lt;ref name=CDF_174-175&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=P_2-4&gt;Poremba (2013), 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard [[Quran desecration|threw her copy of the Quran to the ground]], mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.&lt;ref name=CDF_174-175 /&gt;

==Gameplay==

''Escape from Woomera'' is a [[Point-and-click adventure game#Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure]] game. The player, controlling Mustafa, explores the Woomera centre, which is populated with [[non-player character]]s—computer-controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him information about the facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.&lt;ref name=CDF_174-175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=P_2-3&gt;Poremba (2013), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a meter that tracks Mustafa's hope. As he completes tasks that take him towards the goal of escaping, the meter increases. Listening to the experiences of fellow detainees, which in some cases is required to gain access to other information or tasks, drains Mustafa's hope. If he is caught breaking rules by the guards, Mustafa is placed in solitary confinement, which also drains hope. Should the hope meter run out, Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape, and is deported.&lt;ref name=CDF_174-175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=P_19-20&gt;Poremba (2013), 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polygon&gt;{{cite web|last=Lien|first=Tracey|title=Escape from Woomera still highlights Australia's shame 11 years on|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/16/5717520/escape-from-woomera-immigration-australia|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for a video game centred on asylum seekers in Australia came to Katharine Neil, then an developer at [[Atari]]'s Melbourne studio, in the aftermath of the 2001 [[Tampa affair]].&lt;ref name=CDF_175&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|last=Golding|first=Daniel|title=Videogames and politics: Why was Escape From Woomera so divisive?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/blog/Daniel-Golding/videogames-politics-Escape-From-Woomera-130901/|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil spent a year and a half assembling a team to work on the game and securing initial funding for the project.&lt;ref name=CDF_175 /&gt; Fourteen people contributed to the game, with a core development team of four.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; Many of the Australian members of the development team, including Neil, contributed to the project anonymously to protect their jobs.&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

Neil stated that her motivation for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of [[Mandatory detention in Australia|detained asylum seekers in Australia]], and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task.&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt; At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, and that they were a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly.&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDF_178-179&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Dominic|title=Australia funds asylum game|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2987745.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=30 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plan for ''Escape from Woomera'' involved several choices in playable detainees, each with a different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia. The game would have players "battle the bureaucracy and try and survive day to day" while working towards any of several escape strategies.&lt;ref name=Scan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swalwell|first=Melanie|title=A conversation with the developers of ''Escape from Woomera''|journal=Scan|date=June 2004|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://scan.net.au/scan/journal/print.php?journal_id=28&amp;j_id=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As originally envisioned, players could attempt to escape through the legal channels, using lawyers and activists, or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholls|first=Sean|title=Escape game wires the minister|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/29/1051381951157.html|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=30 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team worked to create the most realistic depiction of the Woomera centre possible, despite the media not being allowed in the facility. The team utilised interviews with former detainees and activists, existing press reports, and a copy of the facility's floor plan obtained from a member of the Department of Immigration.&lt;ref name=CDF_175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; Kate Wild, an [[investigative journalist]] hired by the development team to conduct research, was able to visit [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]]. She witnessed guards using spotlights and helicopters to keep detainees awake throughout the night, and police on horseback trampling over tents.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; Aside from Woomera and Baxter, [[Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]] and [[Villawood Immigration Detention Centre]] were also used as influences.&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; Details from the daily lives of detainees, such as their being referred to by number and communicating with the outside world through payphones, were incorporated into the game.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; Tasks that players had to complete, as well as the escape strategies themselves, were also based on the experiences of real detainees.&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

Initial funding for the development of ''Escape from Woomera'' came from the Australian government's arts funding organisation, the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. The Australia Council gave the developers AUD $25,000, intended to get the game developed to the point that it could secure funding from other sources. While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding.&lt;ref name=CDF_175-176&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; The playable demo, which was built as a [[mod (video gaming)|modification]] of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', was made available for download on the game's website.&lt;ref name=P_2-4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDF_173&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The Australia Council's decision to fund ''Escape from Woomera'' was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began.&lt;ref name=Polygon /&gt; Australia's [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection|Minister for Immigration]], [[Philip Ruddock]], released a statement saying that the "decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour".&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she was surprised at how strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; The leader of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], Dr. [[Seweryn Ozdowski|Sev Ozdowski]], released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that "The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick."&lt;ref name=AHRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape Game is not a laughing matter|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/media-releases/escape-game-not-laughing-matter|publisher=[[Australian Human Rights Commission]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=1 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the decision to fund ''Escape from Woomera'', stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime. He characterised the team's application for funding as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media.&lt;ref name=Age&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Meaghan|title=Refugee group condemns video game|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/30/1051381998181.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=The Age Company Ltd|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=1 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, the retrospective view of ''Escape from Woomera'' is significantly more positive. In 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] called it "one of the first—and still one of the most important—politically-focused videogames".&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; The textbook ''The Alternative Media Handbook'' used the game as a case study in [[culture jamming]], and categorised it as an early example of video games carrying a political message.&lt;ref name=CDF_177-179&gt;Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 177–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''letters of Gustave Flaubert''', the 19th-century French novelist, range in date from 1829, when he was 7 or 8 years old, to a day or two before his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaubert.univ-rouen.fr/jet/public/correspondance/feuilletage_liste_elts.php?t=C |title=Présentation des lettres par ordre chronologique |editor1-last=Leclerc |editor1-first=Yvan |editor2-last=Girard |editor2-first=Danielle |date=2 November 2017 |website=Correspondence: Édition électronique |publisher=Centre Flaubert, Université de Rouen |language=French |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are considered one of the finest bodies of letters in French literature, admired even by many who are critical of [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]'s novels.{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  His main correspondents include family members, business associates and fellow-writers such as [[Théophile Gautier]], the [[Goncourt brothers]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[George Sand]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Émile Zola]].  They provide a valuable glimpse of his methods of work and his literary philosophy, as well as documenting his social life, political opinions, and increasing disgust with bourgeois society.

== Correspondents ==

4481 letters by Flaubert survive,{{sfn|Leclerc|Girard|2017}} a number which would have been considerably higher but for a series of burnings of his letters to his friends.  Many of those addressed to [[Maxime Du Camp]], [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Louis Bouilhet]] were destroyed in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Laurence M. |last2=Gray |first2=Eugene F. |year=2002 |title=Gustave Flaubert's ''Madame Bovary'': A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T_BcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22most+of+his+letters+to+and+from+his+close+friends%22&amp;dq=%22most+of+his+letters+to+and+from+his+close+friends%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiot9SCn87cAhXLyaQKHUWuCR8Q6AEIJzAA |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Greenwood Press |page=145 |isbn=0313319162 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From those that survive it appears that his principal correspondents were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaubert.univ-rouen.fr/jet/public/correspondance/feuilletage_liste_elts.php?corpus=correspondance |title=Présentation des lettres par destinataire |editor1-last=Leclerc |editor1-first=Yvan |editor2-last=Girard |editor2-first=Danielle |date=2 November 2017 |website=Correspondence: Édition électronique |publisher=Centre Flaubert, Université de Rouen |language=French |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family members:&lt;br/&gt;

== Themes ==

Flaubert's personality was rigorously excluded from his novels, but in the letters, written at night after the day's literary work was done, he expresses much more spontaneously his own personal views.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|p=11}}  Their themes often arise from his life as a reader and writer.  They discuss the subject-matter and structural difficulties of his novels, and explore the problems Flaubert faced in their composition, giving the reader a unique glimpse of his art in the making.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=76}}  They illustrate his extensive reading of the creative literatures of France, England (he loved [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]), Germany and the classical world; also his deep researches into history, philosophy and the sciences.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=244}}  Above all, they constantly state and restate Flaubert's belief in the duty of the writer to maintain his independence, and in his own need to reach literary beauty through a quasi-scientific objectivity.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hampshire |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Hampshire |date=16 December 1982 |title=In Flaubert's Laboratory |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/12/16/in-flauberts-laboratory/ |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But his letters also demonstrate an enjoyment of the simple pleasures of Flaubert's youth.  Friendship, love, conversation, a delight in foreign travel, the pleasures of the table and of the bed are all in evidence.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vidal |first1=Gore |author-link1=Gore Vidal |year=1982 |title=Pink Triangle and Yellow Star, and Other Essays (1976–1982) |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xDQgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;dq=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjul5S1l8_cAhXIK8AKHR8tD68Q6AEIQzAF |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |page=29 |isbn=9780434830756 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These do not disappear in his maturer years, but they are offset by discussions of politics and current affairs which reveal an increasing disgust with society, especially bourgeois society, and with the age he lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Rosemary |year=2014 |orig-year=1990 |title=Madame Bovary |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0F4tBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22flaubert's+letters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3jIb9hK3aAhVlKsAKHdNpAMY4FBDoAQg-MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flaubert's%20letters%22&amp;f=false |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |page=21 |isbn=9781138799349 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  They exude a sadness and a sense of having grown old before his time.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=80}}  As a whole, said the literary critic Eric Le Calvez, Flaubert's correspondence, "reveals his vision of life and of the relation between life and art: since the human condition is miserable, life can be legitimated only through an eternal pursuit of art."{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Flaubert letter.jpg|thumb|An 1877 letter from [[Gustave Flaubert]] to [[Léon Cladel]]]]

For many years after the first publication of the letters critical opinion was divided.  [[Albert Thibaudet]] thought them "the expression of a first-rate intellect", and [[André Gide]] wrote that "For more than five years his correspondence took the place of the Bible at my bedside.  It was my reservoir of energy".  [[Frank Harris]] said that in his letters "he lets himself go and unconsciously paints himself for us to the life; and this Gustave Flaubert is enormously more interesting than anything in ''Madame Bovary''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Frank |author-link1=Frank Harris |year=1927 |title=Latest Contemporary Portraits |location=New York |publisher=Macaulay |page=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand [[Marcel Proust]] found Flaubert's epistolary style "even worse" than that of his novels, while for [[Henry James]] the Flaubert of the letters was "impossible as a companion".{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xvii–xviii}}

This ambivalence is a thing of the past, and there is now widespread agreement that the Flaubert correspondence is one of the finest in French literature.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  Publication of them "has crowned his reputation as the exemplary artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-2807?rskey=3k4M21&amp;result=4 |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature (7 ed.) |date=2009 |editor-last=Birch |editor-first=Dinah |editor-link=Dinah Birch |website=Oxford Reference |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enid Starkie]] wrote that Flaubert was one of his own greatest literary creations, and that the letters might well be seen in the future as his greatest book, and the one in which "he has most fully distilled his personality and his wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Starkie |first1=Enid |year=1971 |title=Flaubert the Master: A Critical and Biographical Study (1856-1880) |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |pages=355-356 |isbn=0297002260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], an inveterate enemy of Flaubert's novels, considered the letters a perfect example of pre-Freudian [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and for [[Julian Barnes]] this description "hints at their fluency, profligacy, range and sexual frankness; to which we should add power, control, wit, emotion and furious intelligence.  The ''Correspondance''&lt;!--He is using the title of the French edition, hence the French spelling--&gt;...has always added up to Flaubert's best biography."{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=239}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  Rosemary Lloyd analyses the elements of their appeal as being "partly [their] wide sweep, partly the sense of seeing what Baudelaire called the strings and pulleys of the writer's workshop, and partly the immediacy of Flaubert's changeable, complex and challenging personality."  She continues, "Reading Flaubert's correspondence brings startlingly alive a man of enormous complexity, of remarkable appetites and debilitating lethargies, a knotted network of prejudices, insights, blind spots, passions and ambitions."{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|pp=67, 83}}

Charpentier }}  This four-volume edition was the first to try to collect Flaubert's letters.  The unnamed editor was Flaubert's niece Caroline Commanville; she censored the letters freely, cutting out many passages which she thought indecent or which referred unflatteringly to living persons, especially to herself, and very often failing to notify the reader of these cuts by the use of [[Ellipsis|ellipses]].  She also corrected his punctuation and sometimes "improved" his phrasing.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=68}}{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xv–xvi}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}{{sfn|Cléroux|2013}}

In [[printing]] and [[publishing]], '''proofs''' are the preliminary versions of publications meant for review by authors, editors, and proofreaders, often with extra-wide margins. '''Galley proofs''' may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases [[electronic publishing|electronically transmitted]]. They are created for [[proofreading]] and [[copyediting]] purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes.&lt;ref name="Tapia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt;

== Historical galley proofs ==

'''Proof,''' in the typographical sense, is a term that dates from c. 1600.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The [[typesetter|compositor, typesetter]], or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies.

'''Galley proofs''' or '''galleys''' are so named because in the days of hand-set [[letterpress printing]] in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place.&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for [[proofreading]].&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. 

From the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). 

Once a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.

== Uncorrected proofs ==

An uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below.

These days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term  uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. 
 
Preliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called '''digital proofs,''' '''pdf proofs,''' and '''pre-fascicle''' proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.&lt;ref name="Knuth"/&gt;

== Final proofs ==

Proofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called '''final proofs.''' At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. 

In the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final [[pagination]], if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's [[index (publishing)|index]] and correcting its table of contents.

== Advance reading copies ==

Historically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as [[advance copy|advance copies or advance reading copies]] (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of [[print-on-demand]] (POD) publication. 

Pre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They may be marked or stamped on the cover "uncorrected proof," but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. 

Galley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of "advance praise" notices within the book itself.

'''Genre studies''' is an academic subject which studies '''genre theory''' as a branch of general [[critical theory]] in several different fields, including the literary or artistic, linguistic, or rhetorical.

Literary genre studies is a [[Structuralism#Structuralism in literary theory and literary criticism|structuralist]] approach to the study of [[genre]] and genre theory in [[literary theory]], [[film theory]], and other [[cultural theory|cultural theories]]. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the [[narratology|telling of a story]] and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or [[Code (semiotics)|semiotic codes]]) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.

Linguistic genre studies is best described by two schools of literary genre, the [[Systemic Functional Linguistics]] or "SFL", scholars of this school believe that language structure is an integral part of a text's social context and function.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, Anis and Mary Jo Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.'' Colorado: Parlor Press and WAC Clearinghouse, 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres usefulness in pedagogy.

[[English for Specific Purposes]] or "ESP" is another school of genre studies that examines the pedagogical implications of genre. ESP scholars focus on how genre can help non-native English speakers on how to use the language and its conventions through the application of genre analysis, the identification of discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in the specific discourse community, etc for bringing changes in epideictic schemata.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Paul Gee|author2=Michael Handford|title=The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2T6-LHp8T8C&amp;pg=PA242|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-67292-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one is Rhetorical Genre Studies or "RGS" studies genre as social action. RGS emerged from Carolyn R. Miller's article "Genre as Social Action".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary and linguistic branches==

===Systemic functional linguistics===
{{main article|Systemic functional linguistics}}
Systemic functional linguistics scholars believe that language is organized within cultures based on cultural ideologies. The "systemic" of SFL refers to the system as a whole, in which linguistic choices are made. SFL is based largely on the work of Michael Halliday, who believed that individuals make linguistic choices based on the ideologies of the systems that those individuals inhabit. For Halliday, there is a "network of meanings" within a culture, that constitutes the "social semiotic" of that culture. This "social semiotic" is encoded and maintained by the discourse system of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Michael. ''Language as Social Semiotic''. London: Edward Arnold, 1978. p.100, 13&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday, contexts in which texts are produced recur, in what he calls "situation types." People raised within a specific culture become accustomed to the "situation types" that occur within that culture, and are more easily able to maneuver through the "situation types" within that culture than people who were not brought up within it.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.29-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday's approach to cultural context in the formation of recurrent "situation types" influenced other scholars, such as J.R. Martin. Martin led the SFL pedagogical approach, which emphasized the role of context in text formation. Martin and his associates believed that process-based approaches to education ignored the cultural boundaries of texts, and privileged middle- and upper- class students at the expense of students from lower-class backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p.32&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin and other SFL scholars, an explicit focus on genre in literature would help literacy teaching. Focusing on genre reveals the contexts that influences texts, and teaches those contexts to students, so that they can create texts that are culturally informed.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their genre work in schools, Martin and his associates developed a definition of genre as a "staged, goal-oriented, social process."&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=J.R.|last2=Rose|first2=David|title=Genre relations: Mapping Culture|date=2008|publisher=Equinox Pub.|location=London|isbn=978-1845530488|page=6|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Martinian genre model, genres are staged because they accomplish tasks that require multiple steps; they are goal-oriented because their users are motivated to see the completion of the stages to the end; and they are social because users address their texts to specific audiences.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"/&gt;

===English for Specific Purposes===
{{main article|English for Specific Purposes}}
English for Specific Purposes scholarship has been around since the 1960s, but ESP scholars did not begin using genre as a pedagogical approach until the 1980s, when [[John Swales]] published ''Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings'', in which Swales laid out the methodological approach that brought together ESP and genre analysis.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"/&gt; Swales identified two characteristics of ESP genre analysis: its focus on academic research in English and its use of genre analysis for applied ends.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41-42&lt;/ref&gt; ESP focuses on specific genres within spheres of activity, such as the medical profession, but it also focuses on the broader concept of communicative purposes within fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

English for Specific Purposes shares some characteristics with SFL studies. Both believe that linguistic features are connected to social context and function, and both aim to help disadvantaged students grasp the system in which texts are created so that they can create similar texts, by teaching them the relationship between language and social function. Both try to accomplish their goals by teaching specific genres to underprivileged users.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also some important differences between ESP and SFL. Whereas SFL scholars focus on teaching basic genre structures to primary and secondary school students, ESP scholars are focused on teaching Professional and Academic disciplinary genres to University- and graduate-level students. ESP students tend to be more bound to discursive genre subjects, within very particular contexts. ESP focuses on micro-level genres and contexts, whereas SFL focuses on macro-level contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS)===

Rhetorical Genre Studies (a term coined by Aviva Freedman) scholars examine genre as typified social action, as ways of acting based on recurrent social situations. This founding principle for RGS was taken from Carolyn R. Miller's essay "Genre as Social Action," which was published in 1984.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Genre as Social Action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 70 (1984):151-167&lt;/ref&gt; In her article, Miller examines Frank Lloyd Bitzer's  notion of exigence as a reaction to social situations, and Kenneth Burke's notion of "motive" as human action.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Using Bitzer, particularly, Miller believes it is possible to examine exigence as "an external cause of discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she is able to view situations as social constructions. Genres are typified ways of responding to recurring social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action."&lt;/ref&gt;

RGS scholarship has evolved beyond Miller's founding definition of genre. Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas Huckin begin with the notion that genre is knowledge foundation, and argue that genres embody communities' knowledge and ways of acting.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt; For Berkenkotter and Huckin, genre becomes a way of navigating social activity. As such, it is dynamic, because the conditions of social activity are always in flux. Recurrence, they claim, involves variation.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Berkenkotter and Huckin redefine genre as social cognition.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"/&gt;

The notion of "uptake" is also integral to RGS scholars' understanding of genre. Anne Freadman uses uptake to describe the ways in which genres interact with each other in her articles "Uptake" and "Anyone for Tennis?".&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre:An Introduction''. p.83-84&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the game of tennis to explain the ways genres interact. Tennis players, she says, do not exchange tennis balls, they exchange shots. Each shot only has meaning within the game, its rules, and the context of the game being play.&lt;ref&gt;Freadman, Anne. "Anyone for Tennis." ''Genre and the New Rhetoric''. Ed. Aviva Freedman and Peter Medway. Bristol: Taylor and Francis, 1994. p.43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Shots are meaningful because they take place in a game. The game is meaningful because it takes place within "ceremonials." Thus, the final at Wimbledon provides a different context than a game between friends. Genres are the games that take place within ceremonials, and shots are utterances, or verbal exchanges. We cannot really understand a text without understanding the ceremonial in which it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; "Uptake" is the illocutionary response elicited by particular situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Devitt's research has further complicated the RGS landscape. In ''Writing Genres'', Devitt distinguishes between the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets." The "context of genres" is the overall set of genres available in a culture. A "genre repertoire" refers to the set of genres that a specific group uses to achieve its purposes. "Genre systems" are the sets of genres that function within an activity system. Finally, "genre sets" are more loosely defined sets of genres that function within an activity system, but only define a limited range of actions within that system.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.87&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if we were to take a courtroom as an activity system, a genre set could be defined as only those genres used by the judge. Studying the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets" enables researchers to study the relationships and power structures of activity systems.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"/&gt;

==Generic conventions==
Conventions are usual indicators such as phrases, themes, quotations, or explanations that readers expect to find in a certain genre. They could be considered "[[stereotypes]]" of that genre. For example, [[Science fiction]] is expected to be set in the future, and have futuristic events, technological advances, and futuristic ideas. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] is expected to contain a story about people who could pass as real, struggling through real-life situations and/or real world events, etc.

Critic Paul Alpers explains that literary conventions are like meeting places where past and present writers "come together" to determine the form a convention should take in a particular literary instance (work). In practical terms, this coming together is a matter of the present writer consulting the work of predecessors, but Alpers wants to connote the sense of active negotiation and accommodation that takes place between the writer and the genre he or she is working in (a genre defined by other people). According to Alpers, a misconception persists in modern criticism that literary convention is an "arbitrary and inflexible practice, established by widespread usage and imposed from without." Convention in this sense is the "antithesis of the personal and individual"; it is "felt to constrain the [writer]." Alpers reconceptualizes literary convention as something "constitutive and enabling." For him, generic conventions are "not fixed procedures imposed by impersonal tradition;" rather, they are the living "usages of other [writers]," "the shared practice of those who come together." Thinking of generic conventions as a practice shared by many users, allows later writers to exercise the same degree of control over convention as those who predated them. Far from constraining writers, convention provides flexibility to preserve certain aspects of a genre and transform others. Convention in this sense enables "individual expression, because the [writer] is seen as responsive to, even when challenging, his predecessors and fellows."&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, Paul. "Lycidas and Modern Criticism." ''English Literary History'' 49.2 (1982): 468-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre theorist [[David Fishelov]] also deals with generic conventions—he calls them "generic rules"—in elaborating his explanatory metaphor of "literary genres as social institutions" in the book ''Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory''. Fishelov, like Alpers, sees generic conventions as an inescapably "vital part of the literary communicative situation," linking present and past writers to each other, as well as to readers. Established conventions are "a challenge, or a horizon, against which the writer and his reader have to define themselves." The writer may respond to this challenge by "stretch[ing] the generic rules."&lt;ref name=Metaphors&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishelov|first=David|title=Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory.|year=1993|publisher=The Pennsylvania State UP|location=University Park, PA|pages=85–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishelov draws his metaphor of genre as social institution from a passage in René Welleck and Austin Warren's ''Theory of Literature'':

:The literary kind [genre] is an ‘institution'—as Church, University, or State is an institution. It exists not as an animal exists or even as a building, chapel, library, or capital, but as an institution exists. One can work through, express oneself through, existing institutions, create new ones, or get on, so far as possible, without sharing in politics or rituals; one can also join, but then reshape institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Welleck, René and Austin Warren. ''Theory of Literature''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc., 1942. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

This formulation ascribes agency to actors within social institutions. In the same way institutions like churches, universities, and states organize social actors to accomplish collective social purposes, literary genres organize relationships between writers and readers to accomplish communicative purposes, which change over time. Genres are not static, but rather, like social institutions, persist through the constant renovation of their conventions by individuals. Fishelov is particularly helpful in theorizing the role of the reader in alternately constraining and motivating generic change:

:[T]he reader demands compliance with the established generic conventions so that he can integrate the new text, but at the same time he expects the writer to manipulate these established conventions so that the new text is more than a tedious repetition of the generic tradition.&lt;ref name="Metaphors" /&gt;

Reader expectations operate as both a constraint on the writer and a "latent demand for innovation." The writer "is expected to manipulate the existing conventions and to carry them (at least) one step further…. From the writer's perspective, the generic convention is a model to follow but also a challenge to overcome." Fishelov explains that writers choose or are compelled to manipulate prevailing conventions for a variety of aesthetic and thematic reasons.

==History of genre theory==
Genre theory or genre studies got underway with the [[Greeks]].  The Greeks felt that the type of person an author was would be directly responsible for the type of poetry they wrote.  The Greeks also believed that certain metrical forms were suited only to certain genres. [[Aristotle]] said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have, then, a natural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythm—and starting with these instincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their improvisations.  Poetry then split into two kinds according to the poet's nature.  For the more serious poets represented the noble deeds of noble men, while those of a less exalted nature represented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others wrote hymns and eulogies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is all based on [[Plato]]'s mimetic principle.  Exalted people will, in imitation of exaltation, write about exalted people doing exalted things, and vice versa with the "lower" types (Farrell, 383). Genre was not a black-and-white issue even for Aristotle, who recognized that though the "[[Iliad]]" is an epic it can be considered a tragedy as well, both because of its tone as well as the nobility of its characters.  However, most of the Greek critics were less acutely aware—if aware at all—of the inconsistencies in this system.  For these critics, there was no room for ambiguity in their literary taxonomy because these categories were thought to have innate qualities that could not be disregarded.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] carried on the Greek tradition of literary criticism.  The Roman critics were quite happy to continue on in the assumption that there were essential differences between the types of [[poetry]] and [[drama]].  There is much evidence in their works that Roman writers themselves saw through these ideas and understood genres and how they function on a more advanced level.  However, it was the critics who left their mark on Roman literary criticism, and they were not innovators.

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], when the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] system took over literary criticism, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres.  This is most likely because of [[Christianity]]'s affinity for Platonic concepts.  This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.

===Enlightenment age===
At the end of the 18th century, the theory of genre based on [[classicism|classical]] thought began to unravel beneath the intellectual chafing of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  The introduction of the [[printing press]] brought texts to a larger audience.  Then [[pamphlet]]s and [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] began to diffuse information even farther, and a greater number of less privileged members of society became literate and began to express their views.  Suddenly authors of both "[[High culture|high]]" and "[[Low culture|low]]" culture were now competing for the same audience.  This worked to destabilize the classical notions of genre, while still drawing attention to genre because new genres like the [[novel]] were being generated (Prince, 455).

[[John Locke|Locke]], in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), had reduced data to its smallest part: the simple idea derived from sense.  However, as the science of cognition became more precise it was shown that even this simple idea derived from sense was itself divisible.  This new information prompted David Hartley to write in his ''Observation on Man'' (1749), &lt;blockquote&gt;How far the Number of Orders may go is impossible to say.  I see no Contradiction in supposing it infinite, and a great Difficulty in stopping at any particular Size. (Prince, 456). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The possibility of an infinite number of types alarmed [[theology|theologians]] of the time because their assumption was that rigorously applied [[empiricism]] would uncover the underlying divine nature of creation, and now it appeared that rigorously applied empiricism would only uncover an ever-growing number of types and subsequent sub-types.

In order to re-establish the divine in categorization, the new taxonomical system of [[aesthetics]] arose.  This system offered first beauty, and then the sublime as the taxonomical device.  The problem with Aesthetics was that it assumed the divine and thus the sublime must underlie all these categories, and thus, the ugly would become beautiful at some point.  The paradox is glaring.

===Evolution===
Ever since the late 18th century literary critics have been trying to find a theory of genre that would be more commensurate with the realities of individual texts within genres.  The evolution of genre took many twists and turns through the 19th and 20th centuries. It was heavily influenced by the [[deconstruction]]ist thought and the concept of [[relativism|relativity]].  In 1980, the instability engendered by these two new modes of thought came to a head in a paper written by [[Jacques Derrida]] titled, "The Law of Genre."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." ''Critical Inquiry'' 7.1 (1980):55-81&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article Derrida first articulates the idea that individual texts participate in rather than belong to certain genres.  He does this by demonstrating that the "mark of genre" is not itself a member of a genre or type.  Thus, the very characteristic that signifies genre defies classification.  However, at the end of this essay, Derrida hints at what might be a more fruitful direction for genre theory.  "There, that is the whole of it, it is only what 'I,' so that say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see.  In sum, the law.  The law summoning: what 'I' can sight and what 'I' can say that I sight in this site of a recitation where I/we is."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  By which Derrida means that not only is taxonomy a [[subjectivity|subjective]] sport, but due to this very fact, ''the place and time the taxonomical act takes place'' deserves further study.

Then, in 1986, Ralph Cohen published a paper in response to Derrida's thoughts titled "History and Genre."  In this article Cohen argued that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;genre concepts in theory and in practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons.  And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category.  Genres are open categories.  Each member alters the genre by adding, contradicting, or changing constituents, especially those of members most closely related to it.  The process by which genres are established always involves the human need for distinction and interrelation.  Since the purposes of critics who establish genres vary, it is self-evident that the same texts can belong to different groupings of genres and serve different generic purposes. (Cohen, 204)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Genre Evolution in RGS''

RGS scholars largely agree that while genres are indeed dynamic and constantly evolving entities, they are difficult to change. [[Amy Devitt]] describes this bind, as she considers a genre to be "both the product and the process that creates it" (580).&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Generalizing about Genre: New Conceptions of an Old Concept." College Composition and Communication. 44.4 (1993): 573-586. Web. JSTOR. 22 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; To Devitt, genres not only respond to recurrent situations, but they construct them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Integrating Rhetorical and Literary Theories of Genre." College English. 62.6 (2000): 696-718.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon makes theorizing genre evolution challenging.  [[Carolyn R. Miller]] even cautions against describing genre change as "evolution," as evolution implies progress.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Do Genres Evolve?" Genre 2012: Rethinking Genre 20 Years Later." Carleton University, Ottawa Canada. 27 Jun 2012. Keynote Address&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many RGS scholars have theorized how genres change. [[Jo Ann Yates]] and [[Wanda Orlikowski]] offer that "one person cannot single-handedly effect the change of an institutionalized structure; other relevant participants must adopt and reinforce the attempted change for it to be implemented and sustained in practice" (108).&lt;ref&gt;"Genre Systems: Chronos and Kairos in Communicative Action" The Rhetoric of Ideology and Ideology of Genre. Eds. Richard Coe, Lorelei Lingard, and Tatiana Teslenko. Cresskill, NJ, Hampton Press, 2002. 103-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Yates and Orlikowski then describe how genres evolve: they claim that genres change when a kairotic moment presents itself, and the rhetor, instead of choosing to employ the "genre most appropriately enacted" tries a new method of which the audience accepts as new way of responding to the recurrent situation (119). See [[kairos]]. [[Natasha Artemeva]] has made similar observations based on an eight-year ethnographic survey that followed engineering students from academia and into the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Artemeva, Natasha. "Stories of Becoming: A Study of Novice Engineers Learning Genres of Their Profession." Genre in a Changing World. Eds. Charles Bazerman, Adair Bonini, and Débora Figueiredo.  West Lafayette, Indiana, Parlor Press, 2009. 158-178. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemeva observed two of her subjects impact the evolution of workplace genres when a kairotic moment presented itself (164).  Yet these former student's success in changing the workplace genre also depended on three individually acquired skills: 1) "cultural capital", 2) "domain content expertise", and 3) "agency in the rhetor's ability" to not only see when a kairotic moment presented itself, but "to also seize the opportunity" (167). [[Thomas Helscher]] is not as optimistic; he writes, the "rhetorical constitution of [a] discourse community operates as a counterweight to the process of community growth and change" (30) and argues that the "transformation of the fundamental generic conventions by which communities constitutes themselves...is paradigmatic of the process of social transformation" (32).&lt;ref&gt;Helscher, Thomas P. "The Subject of Genre." Genre and Writing: Issues, Arguments, Alternatives. Ed. Wendy Bishop and Hans Ostrom. Portsmouth, NH: Boynton/Cook 	Publishers, 1997. 27–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state of genre theory==
The definition of genre from [http://www.dictionary.com dictionary.com] is "a class or category of artistic endeavor having a particular form, context, technique, or the like."  Although it seems that genre should be easy to define, the finer points of textual categorization are not yet established.

Genres, according to [[Daniel Chandler]], create order to simplify the mass of available information.  Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos.  [[Jane Feuer]] has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups.  The first is aesthetic.  By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization.  The second classification method is [[ritual]].  Ritual uses its own culture to help classify.  If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system.  The common taxonomic method is [[ideology|ideological]].  This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies.  The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.

[[Amy J. Devitt]] focuses on the [[rhetoric]]al approach to genre.  Scholars generally recognize the restrictions  placed on works that have been classified as a certain genre.  However, viewing genre as a rhetorical device gives the author and the reader more freedom and "allows for choices."  Genres are not free-standing entities, but are actually intimately connected and interactive amongst themselves.  Rhetorical theory of genre recognizes that genres are generated by authors, readers, publishers, and the entire array of social forces that act upon a work at every stage of its production.

This recognition does not make the taxonomy of texts easy.  Chandler points out that very few works have all the characteristics of the genre in which they participate.  Also, due to the interrelatedness of genres, none of them is clearly defined at the edges, but rather fade into one another.  Genre works to promote organization, but there is no absolute way to classify works, and thus genre is still problematic and its theory still evolving.

Moreover, the metagenre as a concept has been an important point to study. According to Giltrow, metagenre is "situated language about situated language". Metagenres such as institutional guidelines can be "ruling out certain kinds of expression, endorsing others", constraining and enabling. The concept of metagenre also provides a valuable way to understand the dynamics of institutional interrelations between genres. In the mental health discourse, for example, has been demonstrated the metageneric function of the American Psychiatric Association's (DSM) for standardizing and mediating the localized epistemological communicative practices of psychiatrists.

==Functions and limits==

Genre began as an absolute classification system in ancient Greece. [[Poetry]], [[prose]] and [[performance]] had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. This classical system worked well as long as the arts were largely directed by nobility and rich patrons. A common understanding of meaning was handy in knowing what the employer expected, and the crowds understood it.

During the Enlightenment period in 18th century Europe, this system of [[patronage]] began to change.  A merchant [[middle class]] began to emerge with money to spend and time to spend it.  Artists could venture away from classical genres and try new ways to attract paying patrons. "Comedy" could now mean Greek metered comedy, or physical camp, or some other type of experience. Artists were also free to use their mediums to express the human condition in a way that was not possible under single patronage, or at least not profitable. Art could be used to reflect and comment on the lives of ordinary people. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. In fact, as far back as ancient Greece, new art forms were emerging that called for the evolution of genre, for example the "tragicomedy."

Unfortunately, genre does have its limitations. Our world has grown so much that it is difficult to absolutely classify something. Information overlaps, and a single book can encompass elements of several genres. For example, a book might be classified as [[fiction]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[science fiction]] and [[African American literature]] all at once.
	 
Genre suffers from the same ills of any classification system. Humans are pattern-seeking beings; we like to create order out of the chaos of the universe. However, when we forget that our order is imposed, often arbitrarily, over a universe of unique experiences, the merit of the individual gets lost. If a system of classification, like genre, is then used to assign value judgments, we allow our preconceptions about the whole to influence our opinion of the individual. Genre is useful as long as we remember that it is a helpful tool, to be reassessed and scrutinized, and to weigh works on their unique merit as well as their place within the genre.

A simple example of the inherent meaning in an art form is that of a [[western movie]] where two men face each other on a dusty and empty road; one wears a black hat, the other white. Independent of any external meaning, there is no way to tell what the situation might mean, but due to the long development of the "western" genre, it is clear to the informed audience that they are watching a gunfight showdown between a [[villain|bad guy]] and a [[hero|good guy]].

It has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

Genre studies have perhaps gained the most recognition in [[film theory]], where the study of genre directly contrasts with [[auteur theory]], which privileges the director's role in crafting a movie.

== In social communities ==
There is something more about genre theory, and to that effect it is necessary to propose Kristen H. Perry's definition. Written (textual) genres are social constructions that represent specific purposes for reading and writing within different social activities, created by social groups who need them to perform certain things. They change over time, reflecting essential shifts in social function performed by that text. Genres also represent constellations of textual attributes: some attributes are necessary and other attributes are optional.

Another definition which shows the different aspects of genre theory is Miller who defines genres as "typified rhetorical actions" that respond to recurring situations and become instantiated in groups' behaviors. Genre evolves as "a form of social knowledge—a mutual construing of objects, events, interests and purposes that not only links them but makes them what they are: an objectified social need". This view sees genres not as static forms but, rather, as "forms of  ways of being ... frames for social action ... environments for learning ... locations within which meaning is constructed" ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]]), suggesting that different communities use different means of communication to accomplish their objectives.

To try to show the importance of the context in genre an example is used about a particular part of the genre theory—speech genres; but it is important to stress that context is really important in all situations. Context plays an important role in shaping genres (Holquist, 1986). Genre theory does not conceptualize context as simply the space outside of text or the container surrounding texts, but as dynamic environments that simultaneously structure and are structured by the communicative practices of social [[Structure and agency|agent]]s. Speech genres are recognizable patterns of language-in-context (Bakhtin, 1986): speech genres include both oral and written forms of language.

Researchers have also shown that the rhetorical moves people must make within accepted genres to communicate successfully in particular contexts operate to reinforce communities' identities and to legitimate particular communication practices. Thus, the genres that communities enact help structure their members' ways of creating, interpreting, and using knowledge (Myers; Winsor, Ordering, Writing; Bazerman, Shaping, Constructing; Berkenkotter and Huckin; Smart).
Genres are very important in our every day life and we do not realize how much we use them, how much they affect us, how much they determine the way we act and understand the others.

==Aspects of genre theory==

===Rhetorical situation===
[[File:James Matthew Barrie00.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. Barrie]]'s works were notoriously hard to place in any single genre.]]
In 1968, [[Lloyd Bitzer]] claimed that [[discourse]] is determined by rhetorical situations in his article titled, "The Rhetorical Situation". A rhetorical situation refers to the fact that every situation has the potential for a rhetorical response. He looks to understand the nature behind the context that determines discourse. Bitzer states, "it is the situation which calls discourse into existence".&lt;ref name=Bitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd F.|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|date=Jan 1968|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2–4|doi=10.2307/40236733}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place. Each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either act upon or not act upon. He expresses the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse, because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation. Discourse varies depending upon the meaning-context that is created due to the situation, and because of this, it is "embedded in the situation".&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;

According to Bitzer, rhetorical situations come into existence, at which point, they can either mature and go away, or mature and continue to exist. Bitzer describes rhetorical situations as containing three components: exigence, [[audience]], and constraints. He highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are necessary to creating discourse. A situation calls a rhetor to create discourse, it invites a response to fit the situation, the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation, the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality, rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures, rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist. Bitzer's main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to "effect valuable changes in real" (Bitzer 14).

In 1984, Carolyn R. Miller examined genre in terms of rhetorical situations. She claimed that "situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of 'definition'".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn R.|title=Genre as Social Action|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=May 1984|volume=70|issue=2|pages=151–67|doi=10.1080/00335638409383686}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, we essentially define our situations. Miller seems to build from Bitzer's argument regarding what makes something rhetorical, which is the ability of change to occur. Opposite of Bitzer's predestined and limited view of the creation of genres, Miller believes genres are created through [[social constructs]]. She agreed with Bitzer that past responses can indicate what is an appropriate response to the current situation, but Miller holds that, rhetorically, genre should be "centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Since her view focuses on action, it cannot ignore that humans depend on the "context of the situation" as well as "motives" that drive them to this action.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Essentially, "we create recurrence," or similar responses, through our "construal" of types.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller defines "types" as "recognition of relevant similarities".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Types come about only after we have attempted to interpret the situation by way of social context, which causes us to stick to "tradition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller does not want to deem recurrence as a constraint, but rather she views it as insight into the "human condition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The way to bring about a new "type",&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines, thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change. Either way, Miller's view is in accordance with the fact that as humans, we are creatures of habit that tightly hold on to a certain "stock of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; However, change is considered innovation, and by creating new "types" we can still keep "tradition"&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; and innovation at the same time.

===Genre as social action===
The concept of genre is not limited to classifications and lists. People interact within genres daily. Genre is determined based "on the action it is used to accomplish" by the individuals using that particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The distance between the text or action of genre and its users does not have to be vast. People respond to exigencies provided by genre every day. Exigence is "a set of particular social patterns and expectations that provides a socially objectified motive for addressing" the recurring situation of a particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Seeing genre as a social action provides the "keys to understanding how to participate in the actions of a [[community]]".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Carolyn R. Miller argues that, "a rhetorical sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse, but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

The idea that rhetorical situations define genre means that participants in genre make decisions based on commonalities and repeat those instances. Genre is not only about the form of but also the mere repetitiveness of similarities. The classroom setting exemplifies this. When students wish to speak, they raise their hands to signify that desire. Raising a hand is the correct response to speaking in turn in that particular social setting. A person at lunch with a group of friends would not raise their hand to speak because the social situation is different. Miller concludes that social actions are the response to "understanding how to participate in the actions of a community".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Carolyn R. Miller builds on arguments made by other scholars while also contradicting Bitzer's argument by giving her readers five features to understand genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  She believes that if something is rhetorical, then there will be action.  Not only will there be action, but this action will also be repeated.  The repetition of action creates a regularized form of discourse.  Miller would add that the result has more to do with the action accomplished by the situation.  Miller recognizes that a person chooses to take a certain social action within a defined set of rules - rules set in place by that user.  Lastly, a situation cannot dictate a response.  Miller ends her article with the thought that genres are partly rhetorical education through her statement, "as a recurrent, significant action, a genre embodies an aspect of cultural rationality".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  Here, Miller unknowingly encapsulates a future ideology about genre: that genres are created by [[culture]].
According to Mnotho Dlamini genre is basically a deep information in a particular context.

===Social construct===&lt;!--romance and comedy are genres.--&gt;
Bitzer's definition of exigence as "an imperfection marked by urgency... something waiting to be done"&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;  ties in with Miller's idea of social action as the next step after an exigency is realized. Miller also points towards the theory that genres recur, based on Jamieson's observation that antecedent genres finding their way into new genres. More importantly, Miller takes on the bigger picture of a rhetorical situation in which all of these steps happen. "Situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of definition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; From this, it is understood that social constructs define situations and, therefore, exigence is also socially situated.

Genre, also, understood in terms of social contexts provides greater meaning to each recurring situation; it essentially allows for differentiation, though past genres have a role in present and new genres. Through this differentiation, genre is allowed to continue evolving, just as social contexts continue to change with time. Bawarshi describes the way in which this happens as "communicants and their social environments are constantly in the process of reproducing one another" (Bawarshi 69). Rhetoric essentially works the same way, as seen in the example of writing Bawarshi provides, "writing is not a social act simply because it takes place in some social context; it is social because it is at work in shaping the very context within which it functions".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, through social constructs, one can shape rhetorical works, and in turn, the works can shape the social context: "we create our contexts as we create our texts".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"/&gt;

===Antecedent genres===
Written in 1975, [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]]'s "Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint" declares that discourse is determined by the [[Rhetorical Situation]], as well as antecedent genres. Antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses. When placed in an unprecedented situation, a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response. However, caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints.&lt;ref name=Jamieson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jamieson|first=Kathleen Hall|title=Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=Dec 1975|volume=61|issue=4|page=414|doi=10.1080/00335637509383303}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands, and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created, the response to the situation might be inappropriate.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Through three examples of discourse, the papal [[encyclical]], the early [[State of the Union Address]], and congressional replies, she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each. These examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation. Jamieson explains, by use of these three examples, that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation. She discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become "bound by the [[manacles]] of the antecedent genre".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt; These "manacles," she says, may range in level of difficultly to escape. Jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present, because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre. She reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of "choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

===Reciprocity of genre===
People often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers. Amy Devitt states this when she says, "A genre is named because of its formal markers" (Devitt 10). However she also says, "the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named" (Devitt 10). When we label something as a certain genre, we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be.  These two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre. Devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list. A question posed by this example is, is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries? Though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another, they are both correct. Similarly, individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre. The rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre. In other words, genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another. Devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants' situation, contexts and text are all mutually created "no one aspect fully determines the other." (Devitt)

===Tyranny of genre===
The phrase "tyranny of genre" comes from genre theorist [[Richard Coe]], who wrote that "the 'tyranny of genre' is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity" (Coe 188). If genre functions as a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification system, it could constrain individual creativity, since "the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification; the presence of fewer features, or the presence of features of other genres, will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification" (Schauber 403).

Genres can act as constraints on readers as well.  Literary historian [[Hans Robert Jauss]] describes genres as creating a "[[horizon of expectation]]" under which readers will interpret texts based on how much they correspond to the features of the genre they recognize from works they have previously read.&lt;ref name=Jauss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jauss|first=Hans Robert|author2=Benzinger, Elizabeth|title=Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1970|volume=2|issue=1|page=13|doi=10.2307/468585}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification-system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres: "The status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity. Such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others" ([[Dominick LaCapra|LaCapra]] 220).

Under the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as "[[Genre#Genre as social action|social action]]" à la Miller,&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre's "tyranny of genre". Relying on the importance of the [[Genre#Rhetorical situation|rhetorical situation]] in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, "The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea [as social action] is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy" (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the [[Genre#Genre as social action|new genre idea]] insists that "human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres" (Killoran 72).

===Stabilization, homogenization and fixity===
Never is there total stabilization in a recognized genre, nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization. However, because of the relative similarities between the terms "stabilization" and "homogenization", the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion. Necessary discourse is, obviously, always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized. In rhetorical situation or antecedent genres, that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses. Outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse, one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate. The unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Fixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. Fixity almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity, depending on the specific choice. If a situation calls for more mediated responses, the fixity of the situation is more prevalent, and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations. Stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand. The only option is affecting homogenization which in turn, can positively or negatively affect stability. Directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency. The same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes, creating either separate genres or modernized micro-genres. (Fairclough)

===Genre ecology and activity theory===
{{main article|Activity theory}}
Activity theory is not grounded in any one area of field of research, but instead draws from several disciplines including psychology, behaviorism, and socio-cultural studies. Although activity theory originated in the social sciences, it is currently applied most frequently to social-scientific, organizational, and writing studies. Modeled as a triangle, activity theory considers how multiple factors (subject, object, mediating artifacts, rules, and division of labor) existing in an activity system (environment) interact to achieve an outcome. Central to activity theory is the concept of mediation. Human activities are driven by a need to achieve a certain outcome or goal. Typically this activity is mediated by artifacts which include tools, language, signs, and cultural norms. In "Textual Objects" Cheryl Geisler explains that texts are traditionally identified as meditational means to complete a task, though she offers that texts might also be identified as the motive in discourse communities in which text is valued as the outcome as opposed to the means of an outcome. Geisler notes that texts produced for meditational means are typically more private/personalized, whereas texts identified as objects are often written with a public motive. She does not argue, however, that texts should exist exclusively as one or the other, but rather she suggests that texts can function as both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geisler|first=Cheryl|title=Textual Objects: Accounting for the Role of Texts in the Everyday Life of Complex Organizations|journal=Written Communication|year=2001|volume=18|issue=1|pages=296–325|doi=10.1177/0741088301018003003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some genre theorists, such as Clay Spinuzzi, genres are tools-in-use, and as such can be seen as mediating objects within the world. This view of genre as a tool-in-use is exemplified in the school of genre theory that studies genres' relationships to activity systems.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, C. J., Antunes, P., &amp; Dias, J. F. (2002). Integrating two organizational Systems through communication genres (pp. 125–132). Presented at the International Conference on Coordination Languages and Models, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Textual Grounding: How People Turn Texts into Tools," Jason Swarts asserts that users utilize texts as tools when they recognize the text's specific value in a rhetorical situation or environment. User's then "ground" texts, altering the texts structure for personal use, to make them usable under very specific conditions. The user takes the text from a "formalized representation of information" to a personal tool. Swarts argues that the meaning of a text is established by uptake of the users, though this varies depending on the user and the user's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swarts|first=Jason|title=Textual Grounding:How People Turn Texts Into Tools|journal=Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|year=2004|volume=34|issue=1|pages=67–89|doi=10.2190/eg0c-quey-f9fk-2v0d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design'', Clay Spinuzzi asserts that the use of certain tools in certain situations can help users to act purposefully in that activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|title=Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design|year=2003|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this tradition of genre studies, "Genres are not discrete artifacts, but traditions of producing, using, and interpreting artifacts, traditions that make their way into the artifact as a form-shaping ideology."&lt;ref&gt;Morson, G.S. and C. Emerson.''Mikhail Bakhtin:Creation of a Prosaics''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990. p.282-284.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of genres as mediating artifacts within activity systems is closely related to [[Activity Theory]], in which the interactions of different spheres of activity are examined. Activity theory, according to David Russell, "traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, David R. "Rethinking Genre in School and Society: An Activity Theory Analysis." ''Written Communication'' (October 1997). p.509.&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theorists examine the ways that the work done in one sphere of activity could potentially change the work done in another. For example, Russell examines how people use writing to mediate their activities, and how changes in one activity can lead to changes in another activity. Russell points out that "the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Russell. "Rethinking Genre." p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; Subtle changes in the use of writing in one activity can effect changes in the use of writing in related systems. If the government sets down new pharmaceutical documentation laws, then the teaching of how to document the distribution of pharmaceuticals will change, not just in pharmacies, but also in hospitals and nursing classrooms. Activity systems are always in flux, because subtle changes in one level of the system result in subtle changes in other levels of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Activity systems are still relatively stable, despite their constant flux. The changes within them are often subtle, and large scale changes usually occur over long periods of time.

'''Genre ecology''' describes the dense connections between genres within the activities that they mediate. Multiple genres mediate a single activity; no genre exists in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, Clay and M. Zachry. "Genre Ecologies: An open-system approach to understanding and constructing documentation." ''Journal of Computer Documentation'' 24.3 (2000). p:172.&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Ecology of Genre" Anis Bawarshi argues that genres are "rhetorical ecosystems" in which participants actively enact and, consequently, reenact social practices, relations, and identities. Participants use genre to interpret and perform social motives which sustain rhetorical ecosystems that produce social contexts, practices, and identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisser|first=Christian|title=Ecocomposition:Theoretical and Pedagogical Approaches|year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinuzzi, and other genre theorists studying the social aspects of genre (like Carolyn R. Miller, Amy Devitt, and Kathleen Jamieson, among others), genre is more than a category or artifact; genre is a way of interacting with the world. In the study of genre ecologies, genre is seen as a way people can accomplish activities.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Like activity systems, genre ecologies are not entirely stable, because activities change, causing the genres mediating them to change, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Take, for example the digitization of the workplace. Before computers, the workspace was largely mediated by genres such as the paper memo,or the company newsletter. After digitization, paper memos and paper newsletters began to disappear. Memos and newsletters did not disappear; instead, their distribution method changed. Now, memos and newsletters are disseminated electronically in emails. The genres of the memo and newsletter still exists, but they have changed, slightly, to reflect the changes in the activity system that they mediate.

===Secondary speech genres===
Mikhail Bakhtin's theorization of complex, secondary speech genres as composites of simple, primary speech genres in the analysis of the interaction between the multiple competing voices and registers in literary works. Bakhtin defines complex, secondary speech genres as "novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, major genres of commentary, and so forth [that] arise in more complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication" (62). While Bakhtin focuses on the historical emergence of the novel in much of his work, in his essay "The Problem of Speech Genres," he makes clear that his theory can be applied to all literary genres, including "profoundly individual lyrical work[s]" (61) such as the pastoral elegy. Complex, secondary speech genres are formed by "absorb[ing] and digest[ing] various primary (simple) genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communion" (62). Primary speech genres are "short rejoinders of daily dialogue," "everyday narration," "brief standard military command" (60), "verbal signals in industry" (63), "letters, diaries, minutes, and so forth" (98), notable for their referentiality to and function within the pragmatic communicative contexts of "extraverbal reality (situation)" (83). When primary speech genres are absorbed by secondary ones, they are "altered and assume a special character," losing "their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others" (62). This process of absorption and digestion of primary speech genres by secondary ones leads to a "more or less distinct dialogization of secondary genres, the weakening of their monological composition" (66). While Bakhtinian dialogization may weaken the monological composition of secondary speech genres, it does not preclude a dominant theme, ideology, or cultural meaning from arising out of interplay of the "various transformed primary genres" (98) that make up a secondary work (although, Bakhtin admits, this dominant ideology is difficult to isolate in complex works, and is, to a certain extent, left open to the interpretation of individual readers). Bakhtin explains that primary genres undergo a more or less thorough process of contestation and resolution within the secondary work they constitute and "enter into actual reality only via the [work] as a whole, that is, as a literary-artistic event and not as everyday life" (62). "As a rule, these secondary genres of complex cultural communication play out various forms of primary speech communication" (Bakhtin 98). Even as a work permits and enacts dialogization between characters, conventional forms, and semantic content, it resolves or "finalizes" that content into a "wholeness" of utterance, which is intelligible to readers, and therefore "guarantee[s] the possibility of response (or of responsive understanding)" (76). Through the finalization of disparate conventional and thematic strands, a work achieves the fullness of what Bakhtin calls its "specific authorial intent," Milton's "speech plan" or "speech will" for his work, and readies itself for responsive understanding (reception, interpretation) on the part of readers (77). Despite its internal dialogization, the work delivers itself to readers as a semantically exhaustive whole, and in this way uses its internal drama to respond ideologically to its genre: "other works connected with it in the overall processes of speech communication in [its] particular cultural sphere" (75). These include "works of predecessors on whom the author relies," "other works of the same school," and "works of opposing schools with which the author is contending" (75). In this way the work forms a crucial "link the chain of speech communion" of its genre (76).&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail M. "The Problem of Speech Genres." ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays''.

The '''Gyeongju Folk Craft Village''' is a village at the foothills of [[Tohamsan|Toman mountain]], in the neighborhood of Ha-dong, [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang]] province, [[South Korea]]. The village was established in 1986 to preserve and develop crafts of the [[Silla]] kingdom. It consists of [[hanok]] or traditional Korean houses including 45 thatched houses (called ''choga'') and roof-titled houses (''giwajip'') where artisans of the Gyeongju origin live and work.&lt;ref name="Doosan"&gt;[http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=741252&amp;contentno=741252 경주 민속공예촌 慶州民俗工藝村] (in Korean) [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gökbez1.jpg|thumb|Gökbez relief]]
The [[Hittite empire|Hittite]] '''Gökbez relief''' is a [[rock relief]] at Gökbez and dates from the time of the [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite states]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The relief is in a courtyard in [[Gökbez, Bor|Gökbez]], [[Bor, Niğde|Bor]] district, [[Niğde Province]], [[Turkey]], about 12&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Kemerhisar]] and 22&amp;nbsp;km south of the provincial capital of [[Niğde]]. Kemerhisar is the site of the ancient city of [[Tyana]] and was centre of the minor [[Luwian]] state of [[Tuwanuwa]]. The ancient route from Tyana, through [[Faustinopolis|Halala]] to the [[Cilician Gates]], which were probably already in use in Hittite times.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Berges, Johannes Nollé: ''Tyana - Archäologisch-historische Untersuchungen zum südwestlichen Kappadokien''. Rudolf Habelt, Bonn 2000 {{ISBN|3-7749-2959-9}} p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; The relief lies beside the old path.

== Description ==
The relief lies broken away and on its side in a courtyard in the village, leaning on the exterior wall of a house. The stone block measures 3.0 metres wide and 2.4 m high, the relief is 2.0 m x 2.0 m. The badly weathered image shows the god [[Tarhunna|Tarhunzas]] facing left. He holds a [[double axe]] in his right hand and a thunderbolt in his left. The god has a beard and long hair which falls to his shoulders. He is dressed in a knee-length robe with a broad belt. A vine grows up between his legs and grape clusters hang down beside him to the left. To the right of the figure is a double arch with a horizontal line running across it two thirds of the way up. [[Dietrich Berges]] and  [[Johannes Nollé]] suggest that it probably originally contained (or was intended to contain) an inscription. Eringhaus thought it was a [[Phrygia]]n double idol, like that described by Dietrich Brendt at [[Yazılıkaya, Eskişehir|Midas Kenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Berndt. "Midasstadt: Kleine und kleinste Felsmonumente. Überlegungen zu einer frühen Besiedlung." in Elmar Schwertheim, Engelbert Winter (Ed.): ''Neue Funde und Forschungen in Phrygien.'' Asia Minor Studien 61, 2006 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The posture and costume of the figure show strong similarities to the [[Niğde Stele]] (on display in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]]), which also depicts Tarhunzas. For this reason, the relief is dated to the late 8th or early 7th century BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8538">The [[hoplite]]s were soldiers from [[Ancient Greece]] who were usually free citizens. They had a very uniform and distinct appearance; specifically they were armed with a [[spear]] (''[[dory]]'') in their right hand and a heavy round [[shield]] in their left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hoplite soldiers were organized in battle into the "[[Phalanx|Phalanx formation]]". The goal of this formation was to create uniformity and a powerful military force in order to maximize the effectiveness as the army as a whole, rather than use people as individual fighters. With the hoplite formation everyone was the same in battle. The Phalanx formation appeared during the 7th and 8th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180753601|title=War in human civilization|last=Azar.|first=Gat,|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199236633|location=Oxford|oclc=180753601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation of hoplites in art show historians how the Greeks used this formation in battle as well as how the soldiers were dressed and what their armor looked like. The hoplite formation is shown in different styles of pottery such as [[White ground technique|white ground]] and [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and also on many different types of pottery such an ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'', ''[[krater]],'' ''[[alabastron]]'', and ''[[dinos]]''. Across all depictions, hoplite soldiers wear the same armor and carry the same weapons in the same position. In addition, the aspect of uniformity is emphasized in these representations.

== Representations in art ==

=== Chigi Vase ===
[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|
Chigi Vase 650-640 BC
]]The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] is a [[Orientalizing period|Protocorinthian]] ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'' and was made by the Chigi Painter from 650-640 BC. The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] was discovered in an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tomb at Monte Aguzzo. It is [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] style with an unusual use of [[Polychrome|polychromy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvaonline.org/tools/pottery/painters/keypieces/corinthian/chigi.htm|title=Greek vases 800-300 BC: key pieces - The Classical Art Research Centre|website=www.cvaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the earliest known representation of the [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey|date=2002|title=Reading the Chigi Vase|url=|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=71|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vase shows the moment that the two hoplite formations come in contact in battle. Each soldier is armed with a decorative round shield in their left hand and a long spear in their right as well as a helmet. Behind the soldiers is a flute player that may have been used to keep the hoplites marching correctly. The [[Chigi vase]] is arguably one of the most important representations of the Hoplite Soldier in [[Ancient Greek art|Greek Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chigi Vase gives historians as insight to how the phalanx formation was used in battle.

=== Terracotta Alabastron ===
[[File:Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase) MET DP119906.jpg|thumb|Terracotta alabastron 590–570 BC]]
This Middle [[Corinthia]]n perfume vase from 590–570 BC contains two friezes of the [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]]. The [[terracotta]] vase uses a form of [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and is only 21.3&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Both friezes show hoplites with a circular shield in their left hand, spear in their right, as well as a typical hoplite helmet. All of the hoplites are faced in the same way and have about the same distance in between their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase)|date=ca. 590–570 B.C.|url=https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247192|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could reflect the state of uniformity and the lack of individualism within hoplite warfare. The top frieze is interrupted by another figure who does not resemble a hoplite soldier. The rest of the vase is decorated with lines and dots, creating zones on the vase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amyx, Darrell A. 1988. Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. no. 4, p. 156, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.|first=Darrell|date=1988|title=Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period|url=|journal=University of California Press|volume=4|pages=156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoplite black figure Dinos  ===
This Attic black figure [[Dinos]] now located in [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was made by "The Louvre Painter" in 560 BC. It contains three friezes. The first depicts [[Troilus|Troilos]] and Polyxena at the fountain, a  Centauromachy, the return of [[Hephaestus|Hephaistos]], and a [[symposium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20E%20876&amp;object=Vase|title=Louvre E 876 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle frieze shows a [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]], and the bottom frieze shows a horse race. The frieze with the hoplites shows two hoplite formations engaging in battle. The hoplite in front of the first phalanx advances to the left over a body. Another hoplite extends his arm as he leans to throw he spear to the warrior in front of him. The warriors on foot all possess typical characteristics of hoplites with their spear and round shield as well as their helmet. In addition the hoplites are close to each other in proximity which is a feature of the [[Phalanx|phalanx formation]].

=== Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater ===
[[File:Hoplite fight from Athens Museum.jpg|thumb|
Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater
]]This Calyx Krater was made in 530 BCE from [[Farsala|Pharsala]] and uses the [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] stye. It is also painted  in the manner of [[Exekias]]. The [[Krater|Calyx Krater]]  depicts the scene a Four-horse [[chariot]] and a [[Homer]]ic battle around the body of a dead warrior, that might be [[Patroclus|Patroklos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/vases/archaic/archaic14-en.html#|title=NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF ATHENS - OFFICIAL SITE|website=www.namuseum.gr|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the scene is on the two hoplites clashing in battle, behind each of them is a hoplite phalanx. This image gives insight into how two hoplite formations engaged in battle. The figures can be identified as hoplites because of their round [[Round shield|shield]] in their left hand as well as their spear in the right hand.

=== Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Alabastron ===
The "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Ababastron]" was made by the [[Haimon Painter|Haimon painter]] in 480 BC and it from the late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. It is attic black figure and white ground. The lower frieze represents a  [[Gigantomachy]]. [[Heracles|Herakles]] and [[Athena]] fight five [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]], four of whom are represented as hoplites. The viewer can tell that the giants are hoplites because of the typical helmets, the round shield held in the left hand, and the spear in the right hand. One of the hoplite [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]] is on the ground to due to his fight with Athena. the others are attacking Herakles from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase|title=Harvard 1920.44.54 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work of art is an interesting take on the typical [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantomachy]]. The representation of the hoplite formation in this period hints that the Greeks were still using this formation in warfare. In addition, this [[alabastron]] is an example of the combination of a mythological battle (the Gigantomachy) and aspects of real battles (the hoplite formation) that we see in other examples of Greek Art, specifically the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Akropolis]] and the [[Stoa Poikile]] on the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Classical Agora]].

'''Jerome "Jerry" Balmuth''' (May 8, 1924 - September 28, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and the Harry Emerson Fosdick Professor of Philosophy and Religion, Emeritus, at [[Colgate University]] in [[Hamilton, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerome Balmuth|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/uticaod/obituary.aspx?pid=186821402|publisher=The Observer-Dispatch|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Balmuth developed his interest in philosophy after high school, when he enrolled in a philosophy night course at the [[City College of New York]]. In 1944 he joined the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] unit. He subsequently attended [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|officer candidate school]] and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, transferring to the military police.

'''Jolie laide''' (English translation: "beautiful ugly") is the French expression used to describe someone who is unconventionally beautiful. Snaggle teeth, a bump in the nose, closely set eyes are just a few examples of unconventional physical traits, which some might view as deformities, that are embraced under the notion of jolie laide. Although the concept of jolie laide recognizes that ''men act and women appear'' (as the writer John Berger once put it), it also recognizes that behind the visceral image lies an internal life.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merkin|first=Daphne|title=The Unfairest of Them All|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/style/tmagazine/t_b_2122_talk_jolie_laide_.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=16 October 2005|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the literary critic Daphne Merkin put it, jolie laide is "a triumph of personality over physiognomy, the imposition of substance over surface."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; 

It is unclear when and where the term arose in French culture. Some have surmised that the term comes out of Serge Gainsbourg's song "Laide Jolie Laide."&lt;ref name="Ollivier 272"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ollivier|first=Debra|title=What French Women Know: About Love, Sex, and Other Matters of the Heart and Mind|year=2010|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=USA|isbn=042523648X|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Celebrities commonly thought to encapsulate this notion include: [[Anjelica Huston]] whose "regal asymmetry defies the norms of magazine 'pretty'";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ollivier|first=Debra|title=What French Women Know: About Love, Sex, and Other Matters of the Heart and Mind|year=2010|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=USA|isbn=042523648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sofia Coppola]] with her "introspective, girl-in-a-Vermeer-painting aura rather than the paint-by-numbers cheerleader vibe of Lindsay Lohan.";&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] with her "melancholic air and the vaguely awkward way she inhabits her lanky body".&lt;ref name="Ollivier 272" /&gt; The late [[Isabella Blow]] has also been described by this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/34732/?ref=fashion|title=The Sad Hatter|last=Larocca|first=Amy|date=15 May 2007|publisher=''New York Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the similar object in China|Hanging scroll}}
[[Image:Hanging scroll and Ikebana 1.jpg|right|225px]]
A {{nihongo|'''''kakemono'''''|掛物||"hanging thing"}}, more commonly referred to as a {{nihongo|'''''kakejiku'''''|掛軸||"hung scroll"}}, is a Japanese [[scroll]] painting or [[calligraphy]] mounted usually with [[silk]] fabric edges on a flexible backing, so that it can be rolled for storage.

The "Maruhyōsō" style of kakejiku has four distinct named sections. The top section is called the "ten" heaven. The bottom is the "chi" earth with the "hashira" pillars supporting the heaven and earth on the sides. The maruhyōsō style, (not pictured above) also contains a section of "ichimonji" made from "kinran" gold thread.&lt;ref&gt;Hyodokai &amp; Tooru Arakawa, "Watakushi ni mo Dekiru Hyōgu no Tsukurikata Nyūmon". Shibuya, Japan 1997 pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; On observation, the Ten is longer than the Chi. This is because in the past, Kakemono were viewed from a kneeling (seiza) position and provided perspective to the "Honshi" main work. This tradition carries on to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Conversation, Sagawa, Taishin, Hyōsōshi Instructor of Shibuya Kakejikuya.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a cylindrical rod called ''jikugi'' (軸木) at the bottom, which becomes the axis or center of the rolled scroll. The end knobs on this rod are in themselves called ''jiku'', and are used as grasps when rolling and unrolling the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Masako Koyano, ''Japanese Scroll Paintings: A Handbook of Mounting Techniques''. Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Washington D.C., 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the scroll include the "jikubo" referenced above as the jikugi. The top half moon shaped wood rod is named the "hassō" to which the "kan" or metal loops are inserted in order to tie the "kakehimo" hanging thread. Attached to the jikubo are the "jikusaki", the term used for the end knobs, which can be inexpensive and made of plastic or relatively decorative pieces made of ceramic or lacquered wood. Additional decorative wood or ceramic pieces are called "fuchin" and come with multicolored tassels. The variation in the kakehimo, jikusaki and fuchin make each scroll more original and unique.&lt;ref&gt;Hyodokai &amp; Tooru Arakawa, "Watakushi ni mo Dekiru Hyōgu no Tsukurikata Nyūmon". Shibuya, Japan 1997 pg. 130-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Custom Japanese Calligraphy, Jonathan Maples, excerpts translated from the Arakawa text&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15874">The following is a non-exhaustive list of [[K-pop]] videos that have been banned by South Korean television networks, for reasons such as suggestive or offensive lyrics and imagery.

K-pop is a genre of modern [[pop music]] that originates from [[South Korea]]. It is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements, and K-pop singles will typically include a music video and a dance routine. There is a history of media [[censorship in South Korea|censorship]] and [[conservatism in South Korea]], and as a result, many risque or explicit K-pop songs or videos have been banned by South Korean broadcasting stations. Other reasons for banning include having Japanese lyrics, negatively influencing youth, or use of brand names.

[[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] are the three largest broadcasting and television networks, and they account for the vast majority of banned K-pop videos. In September 2012, it was revealed that these networks had banned over 1,300 K-pop songs in the past three years alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/89575/20140430/what-it-takes-to-get-a-song-banned-from-broadcast-stations-in-korea.htm|title=What It Takes To Get A Song Banned From Broadcast Stations In Korea|last=KpopStarz|date=2014-04-30|work=KpopStarz|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This list only includes titular k-pop songs that have an accompanying music video, but many K-pop songs that were not title tracks have been banned as well.

== Aftermath of bans ==

=== Revising ===
Often, the entertainment company that owns the banned song will try to revise the song and have its reevaluated by the broadcasting company. They may edit the music video and delete the controversial scenes and re-release the new video. Other times, they may alter the explicit dance moves or change a song's lyrics so that the song may still be performed on music shows, such as [[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank.]] In the case of EXO's "Lotto," which as banned due to the title being a brand name, the group sang the word "louder" instead of "lotto" while performing the song live. This revision allowed the song to be performed on KBS and MBC music shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although K-pop songs and videos are often banned by KBS, is it less often for MBC or SBS to place a ban. Some groups are content to promote themselves on networks other than KBS and do not make any changes to their original material. In regards to PSY's "Gentlemen," a spokesperson for YG Entertainment said they had no plans to submit a difference version of their video, and they followed the decision made by KBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/04/18/south-korean-tv-network-bans-psys-video/|title=South Korean TV Network Bans Psy’s Video|last=Kwaak|first=Jeyup S.|date=2013-04-18|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 12 out of 18 songs of [[Cheetah (rapper)|Cheetah]]'s album were deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS and five by SBS, the agency stated that they did not plan on making any changes to the lyrics in order to "keep the original intentions and meanings of the song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/02/12-songs-in-cheetahs-new-album-deemed-unfit-for-kbs-agency-says-no-changes-will-be-made-in-lyrics|title=12 songs in Cheetah's new album deemed unfit for KBS + agency says no changes will be made in lyrics|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan reactions ===
Of all the broadcasting networks, KBS has banned the most songs and videos, earning it the nickname "Korean Banning System." When a more explicit video is released, fans have come to expect the video to be deemed inappropriate for broadcast by KBS.

There have been cases of fans arguing against a banning decision. When KBS deemed several of Block B's new songs as being unfit for broadcast, an online petition appeared, requesting that KBS reconsider their decision. It gained 2,400 signatures within a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2012/01/kbs-deems-block-bs-new-songs-unfit-for-broadcast|title=KBS deems Block B's new songs unfit for broadcast|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9163">The '''Sir Hugh Casson Award''' for the worst new building of the year has been awarded annually since 1982 by the 'Nooks and Corners' column of the British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The name ironically honours [[Hugh Casson|Sir Hugh Casson]]. Column author [[Gavin Stamp]] explained in 2015 that "he would turn up - take a fee - for giving evidence at public inquiries to recommend the demolition of buildings: a trade I despise". Stamp noted that Casson would sometimes mention his office as Vice-Chairman of [[The Victorian Society]] when arguing for the demolition of Victorian buildings. The medal of the award uses a sketch of Casson which is a [[self-portrait]].&lt;ref name="Page 94"&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Page 94: The Private Eye Podcast.

'''''Living Still Life''''' (French: '''''Nature Morte Vivante'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'')'' is a painting by the artist [[Salvador Dalí]]. Dali painted this piece during a period that he called “Nuclear Mysticism.”&lt;ref&gt;'"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life – Fast Moving)," Unparalled Collections of Salvador Dali Art Works, theDali.org., 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Mysticism is composed of different theories that try to show the relationships between [[quantum physics]] and the conscious mind. The different theories are composed of elements that range from “Catalan philosophers” to “[[classicism]], [[pop art]], and [[nuclear physics]].”&lt;ref&gt;Baden, E., "Dali, Salvador. Salvador Dali: The Late Work," CHOICE: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, (2011), 1070.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting, done in 1956, currently resides at the [[Salvador Dali Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

The name ''Nature Morte Vivante'' translates in English to “living still life.” It comes from the French translation “nature morte” which directly translates to “dead nature.” By adding “vivante,” which implies “fast moving action and a certain lively quality,” onto the end of that, Dali was essentially naming this piece “dead nature in movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” UMI Dissertation publishing, (2000), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  This plays into his theme of Nuclear Mysticism which combined elements of art, physics, and science. The theory, as well as the term, “Nuclear Mysticism” was coined by Dali himself. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Dali started to “return to his [[Catholicism|Catholic]] roots following [[World War II]].”&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Mysticism: Salvador Dali.” Tufts University, n.d. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear mysticism is composed of different theories by Dali that combine science, physics, math, and art. Post WWII, Dali became fascinated by the [[atom]]. Dali stated that after the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in [[Japan]] that it “shook me [Dali] seismically” and that the atom was his “favorite food for thought.”&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dali saw the beauty of the atom and was interested in the how the atom makes up everything. In this painting, Dali wanted to show the motion that all objects have, that although an object is still, it is always full of millions of atoms that are constantly in motion. He portrays this thought throughout his painting. Every object in the painting is moving in some direction, one that an object of that type normally does not do. Dali was also obsessed with the spiral, which he thought to be “the most important feature in nature”, and used it as “a symbol of cosmic order.”&lt;ref&gt;The Dali Museum, “Nature Morte Vivante.”&lt;/ref&gt;   Dali portrayed this idea by adding a spiral in the top right corner of his painting. Not only does Dali portray his objects flying around the scene, he shows them twisted in usual ways. For example, the silver bowl is not only shown mid-air, but also twisted in an unnatural way for silver to bend. Dali also infused religious elements of Nuclear Mysticism into this painting. On the table with the white tablecloth, the objects placed closest to the table and that appear to be the least in motion are a glass of wine, two grapes, a pear, a glass bottle with water pouring out, and what appears to be a fig leaf. The fig leaf has long been a religious symbol associated with [[Christianity]]. In the Bible, [[Adam and Eve]] use fig leaves to cover themselves after their deception in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The placement of the fig leaf in Dali’s painting could allude to his reemergence back into Catholicism.

Dali took inspiration from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Floris Van Schooten]] and his painting ''Table with Food'' for his own painting ''Nature Morte Vivante''.&lt;ref&gt;Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Schooten’s painting, which was a very common type of painting for its time, was a very typical still life that depicted food and drinks on a table with a crisp white tablecloth. Dali wanted to give his own take on it, and give it his [[surrealist]] signature by showing all of the objects in motion. He also added the tablecloth, which looks very similar to tablecloths that Schooten had used throughout his own paintings. Even though most of the objects Dali portrays are ordinary things, he puts a spin, literally and figuratively, on the motion and placement of the objects. The disarray of the objects alludes to his interest in nuclear mysticism. He believed that “all matter was not at all like it seemed, but instead had attributes that even he was only able to guess.” He wanted to enforce that “that all objects are made of atomic particles in constant motion,” which he portrays through the scattered items.&lt;ref&gt;Felks, P,. and P. Paul. “Analysis of “Nature Morte Vivante, 1956.” Salvador Dali Art Gallery, n.d. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted the still life objects to move in a life of his own, without the complacency of a typical still life.

	''Nature Morte Vivante'' is arguably the most “Dali-esque” painting he has done. He took something as simple and universal as a still life, which artists have been creating and recreating for thousands of years, and put his signature style on it. This painting perfectly captures his theory of nuclear mysticism, and helps to bring it to life and give the public a visual of his theory, Nuclear Mysticism.

The '''Los Angeles Philharmonic''' (LA Phil or LAP) is an American [[orchestra]] based in Los Angeles, California. It has a regular season of concerts from October through June at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], and a summer season at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] from July through September. [[Gustavo Dudamel]] is the current Music Director, and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] is Conductor Laureate.

==History==

===1919–1933: Founding the Philharmonic===
[[File:Walter Henry Rothwell.png|thumb|right|200|Walter Henry Rothwell (1872-1927), first Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.]]

The orchestra was founded and single-handedly financed in 1919 by [[William Andrews Clark, Jr.]], a copper baron, arts enthusiast, and part-time violinist. He originally asked [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] to be the Philharmonic's first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected [[Walter Henry Rothwell]], former assistant to [[Gustav Mahler]], as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony. The orchestra played its first concert in the [[Trinity Auditorium]] in the same year,&lt;ref name="latimescomeback"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vincent |first=Roger |date=September 19, 2005 |title=Another L.A. Comeback: A landmark auditorium will reopen as part of the conversion of a defunct downtown hotel into the Gansevoort West. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/19/business/fi-hotel19 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eleven days after its first rehearsal.  Clark himself would sometimes sit and play with the second violin section.&lt;ref name="swed"&gt;{{cite news| first=Mark| last=Swed| title=The Salonen-Gehry Axis| work=The Los Angeles Times Magazine| url=http://www.calendarlive.com/music/swed/cl-tm-philharmonic35aug31,0,1343085.story?coll=cl-swed| date=31 August 2003| accessdate=2008-05-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311021112/http://www.calendarlive.com/music/swed/cl-tm-philharmonic35aug31,0,1343085.story?coll=cl-swed| archivedate=11 March 2007| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rothwell's death in 1927, subsequent Music Directors in the decade of the 1920s included [[Georg Schnéevoigt]] and [[Artur Rodziński]].

===1933–1950: Harvey Mudd rescues orchestra===
[[Otto Klemperer]] became Music Director in 1933, part of the large group of German emigrants fleeing Nazi Germany. He conducted many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to important new works by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. The orchestra responded well to his leadership, but Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes.
[[Image:Hollywood bowl and sign.jpg|left|thumb|Hollywood Bowl]]
Things were further complicated when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created with the goal to stabilize the orchestra's funding, with the association's president, [[Harvey Seeley Mudd|Harvey Mudd]], stepping up to personally guarantee Klemperer's salary. The Philharmonic's concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] also brought in much needed revenue.&lt;ref name="swed"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Story| first=Alan| last=Rich| work=The Los Angeles Philharmonic Inaugurates Walt Disney Concert Hall| network=[[PBS]]| accessdate=2008-05-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807162206/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| archivedate=2008-08-07| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that, the orchestra managed to make it through the worst of the [[Great Depression]] years still intact.

Then, after completing the 1939 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl, Klemperer was visiting Boston and was incorrectly diagnosed with a brain tumor, and the subsequent brain surgery left him partially paralyzed. He went into a depressive state and was institutionalized. When he escaped, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a cover story declaring him missing. After he was found in New Jersey, a picture of him behind bars was printed in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. He subsequently lost the post of Music Director, though he still would occasionally conduct the Philharmonic. He led some important concerts, such as the orchestra's premiere performance of Stravinsky's ''[[Symphony in Three Movements]]'' in 1946.&lt;ref name="swed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laphil.com/music/piece_detail.cfm?id=2458&amp;bc=1 |title=About the Piece:  Symphony in Three Movements |first=Herbert |last=Glass |publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic |accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Barbirolli|Sir John Barbirolli]] was offered the position of Music Director after his contract with the New York Philharmonic expired in 1942. He declined the offer and chose to return to England instead.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Kennedy, Michael. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30578 Barbirolli, Sir John (1899–1970),] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2009, (subscription required), accessed 7 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, [[Alfred Wallenstein]] was chosen by Mudd to lead the orchestra. The former principal cellist of the [[New York Philharmonic]], he had been the youngest member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when it was founded in 1919. He turned to conducting at the suggestion of [[Arturo Toscanini]]. He had conducted the L.A. Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl on a number of occasions and, in 1943, took over as Music Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.american-music.org/publications/bullarchive/Meckna.html| first=Michael| last=Meckna| title=Alfred Wallenstein: An American Conductor at 100| journal=The Society for American Music Bulletin (Formerly the Sonneck Society for American Music Bulletin)| volume=XXIV| issue=3| date=Fall 1998| accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the highlights of Wallenstein's tenure were recordings of concertos with fellow [[Angeleno]]s, [[Jascha Heifetz]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name="swed"/&gt;

===1951–1968: Dorothy Buffum Chandler's influence===
By the mid-1950s, department store heiress and wife of the publisher of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler]] became the de facto leader of the orchestra's board of directors. Besides leading efforts to create a performing arts center for the city that would serve as the Philharmonic's new home, and would eventually lead to the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], she and others wanted a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra; after Wallenstein's departure, Chandler led efforts to hire then [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] principal conductor, [[Eduard van Beinum]] as the LAPO music director. The Philharmonic's musicians, management and audience all loved Beinum, but in 1959, he suffered a massive heart attack while on the podium during a rehearsal of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and died.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

In 1960, the orchestra, led again by Chandler, signed [[Georg Solti]] to a three-year contract to be music director after he had guest conducted the orchestra in winter concerts downtown, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], and in other Southern California locations including CAMA concerts in Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Concert Listings, 1950–1960| work=CAMA Archives| url=http://www.camasb.org/archives/1950-60.shtml| publisher=Santa Barbara Community Arts Music Association| accessdate=2008-05-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602023727/http://www.camasb.org/archives/1950-60.shtml| archivedate=2008-06-02| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solti was to officially begin his tenure in 1962, and the Philharmonic had hoped that he would lead the orchestra when it moved into its new home at the then yet-to-be-completed [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]; he even began to appoint musicians to the orchestra.&lt;ref name="Leeds"&gt;{{cite news| first=Jeff| last=Leeds| title=Sir Georg Solti: Led Chicago Symphony to World Renown| work=The Los Angeles Times| date=6 September 1997| accessdate=November 6, 2017| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/158995071/?terms=george%2Bsolti%2Bled%2Bchicago| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Solti abruptly resigned the position in 1961 without officially taking the post after learning that the Philharmonic board of directors failed to consult him before naming then 26-year-old [[Zubin Mehta]] to be assistant conductor of the orchestra.&lt;ref name="Time writers"&gt;{{cite news| title=Buffie &amp; the Baton| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872266,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=14 April 1961| accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehta was subsequently named to replace Solti.

===1969–1997: Ernest Fleischmann's tenure===
&lt;!--[[Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group]] redirects directly here.--&gt;

In 1969, the orchestra hired [[Ernest Fleischmann]] to be Executive Vice President and General Manager. During his tenure, the Philharmonic instituted a number of then-revolutionary ideas, including the creation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group and its "Green Umbrella" concerts; both of these adjunct groups were composed of the orchestra's musicians but offered performance series which were separate and distinct from traditional Philharmonic concerts. They were eventually imitated by other orchestras throughout the world. This concept was ahead of its time, and was an outgrowth of Fleischmann's philosophy, most famously laid out in his 16 May 1987 commencement address at the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]] entitled, "The Orchestra is Dead. Long Live the Community of Musicians."

When Zubin Mehta left for the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1978, Fleischmann convinced [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] to take over as Music Director. Giulini's time with the orchestra was well regarded, however, he resigned the position after his wife became ill, and returned to Italy.

In 1985, Fleischmann turned to [[André Previn]] with the hopes that his conducting credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including [[Kurt Sanderling]], [[Simon Rattle]], and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as "Principal Guest Conductor", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992.&lt;ref name="Bernheimer"&gt;{{cite news| title=The Tyrant of Philharmonic| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Martin| last=Bernheimer| date=8 October 1989| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/175265106/?terms=The%2BTyrant%2Bof%2BPhilharmonic| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.

Salonen's tenure with the orchestra first began with a residency at the 1992 [[Salzburg Festival]] in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' by [[Olivier Messiaen]]; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the [[Lucerne Festival]] in Switzerland, [[The Proms]] in London, in [[Cologne]] for a festival of Salonen's own works, and in 1996 at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris for a [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] festival conducted by Salonen and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It was during the Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were reinvigorated to lead fundraising efforts for the soon-to-be built [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].

Under Salonen's leadership, the Philharmonic has become an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] of ''The New Yorker'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Salonen era in L.A. may mark a turning point in the recent history of classical music in America. It is a story not of an individual magically imprinting his personality on an institution—what Salonen has called the "empty hype" of conductor worship—but of an individual and an institution bringing out unforeseen capabilities in each other, and thereby proving how much life remains in the orchestra itself, at once the most conservative and the most powerful of musical organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
... no American orchestra matches the L.A. Philharmonic in its ability to assimilate a huge range of music on a moment's notice. [[Thomas Adès|[Thomas] Adès]], who first conducted his own music in L.A. [in 2005] and has become an annual visitor, told me, "They always seem to begin by finding exactly the right playing style for each piece of music—the kind of sound, the kind of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], breathing, attacks, colors, the indefinable whole. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is." [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] calls the Philharmonic "the most ''Amurrican'' {{sic}} of orchestras. They don't hold back and they don't put on airs. If you met them in twos or threes, you'd have no idea they were playing in an orchestra, that they were classical-music people."&lt;ref name="Ross1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1998–2009===
When Fleischmann decided to retire in 1998 after 28-years at the helm, the orchestra named Willem Wijnbergen as its new Executive Director. Wijnbergen, a Dutch pianist and arts administrator, was the managing director of the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam. Initially, his appointment was hailed as a major coup for the orchestra.

One of his most important decisions was to modify Hollywood Bowl programing:  he increased the number of jazz concerts and appointed [[John Clayton (bassist)|John Clayton]] serving as the orchestra's first Jazz Chair; in addition, he established a new [[World Music]] series with [[Tom Schnabel]] as programming director&lt;ref name="Dutka"&gt;{{cite news| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Elaine| last=Dutka| title=Bowl Reveals Tempo Changes| date=November 11, 1998| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/11/entertainment/ca-41419| accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some successes, Wijnbergen left the orchestra in 1999 after only one controversy-filled year, and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired by the Philharmonic's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Off-the-Podium Intrigue Surrounds Two Leading Jobs| work=The New York Times| first=Bernard| last=Holland| date=22 August 1999| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DC1F39F931A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2| accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year, [[Deborah Borda]], then the Executive Director of the [[New York Philharmonic]], was hired to take over executive management of the orchestra. She began her tenure in January 2000, and was later given the title of President and Chief Executive Officer. After financial problems experienced during Wijnbergen's short tenure, Borda — "a formidable executive who runs the orchestra like a lean company, not like a flabby non-profit" — "put the organization on solid financial footing."&lt;ref name="Ross1"/&gt;  She is widely credited (along with Salonen, [[Frank Gehry]], and [[Yasuhisa Toyota]]) for the orchestra's very successful move to [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], and for wholeheartedly supporting and complementing Salonen's artistic vision.  One example cited by [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps Borda's boldest notion is to give visiting composers such as [[John Adams (composer)|[John] Adams]] and [[Thomas Adès]] the same royal treatment that is extended to the likes of [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and [[Joshua Bell]]; Borda talks about "hero composers." A recent performance of Adams's monumental California symphony "Naïve and Sentimental Music" in the orchestra's Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda's big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra's long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer [[Brett Dean]] recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a double take, saying that it was the largest new-music audience he'd ever seen.&lt;ref name="Ross1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 13, 2005, a young Venezuelan conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, made his debut with the LA Phil at the orchestra's summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. In his U.S. debut Tuesday night, a 24-year-old conductor from Venezuela with curly hair, long sideburns and a baby face accomplished something increasingly rare and difficult at the Hollywood Bowl.  He got a normally restive audience's full, immediate and rapt attention.  And he kept it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Swed| first=Mark| title=He holds Bowl in palm of his hands| date=September 15, 2005| url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2005/sep/15/news/wk-bowl15| newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2007, Dudamel made his Walt Disney Concert Hall debut with the LA Phil prompting Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed to write, "Greatness like this doesn't come around often."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Swed| first=Mark| title=Indoors or out, this guy's the real deal| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/06/entertainment/et-phil6| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few months later, on April 9, 2007, the symphony board announced that Esa-Pekka Salonen would step down as the LAP's music director at the end of the 2008–2009 season, and  Gustavo Dudamel would succeed him.&lt;ref name="Leeds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time writers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernheimer"/&gt; In 2007, two years before Dudamel's official start as music director, the LA Phil established [[Youth Orchestra Los Angeles|YOLA (Youth Orchestra Los Angeles)]].

==Performance venues==
[[Image:Walt Disney Concert Hall and surrounding area.jpg|right|thumb|Walt Disney Concert Hall]]

The orchestra played its first season at Trinity Auditorium at Grand Ave and Ninth Street. In 1920, it moved to Fifth Street and Olive Ave, in a venue that had previously been known as [[Hazard's Pavilion|Clune's Auditorium]], but was renamed Philharmonic Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laphil.com/about/history.cfm |title=History of the Los Angeles Philharmonic |publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114204809/http://www.laphil.com/about/history.cfm |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2003, the orchestra played its main subscription concerts in the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] of the [[Los Angeles Music Center]]. In 2003, it moved to the new [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] designed by [[Frank Gehry]] adjacent to the Chandler. Its current "winter season" runs from October through late May or early June.

Since 1922, the orchestra has played outdoor concerts during the summer at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], with the official "summer season" running from July through September.

The LA Philharmonic has played at least one concert a year in its sister city, [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], presented by the [[Community Arts Music Association]] (CAMA), along with other regular concerts throughout various Southern California cities such as [[Costa Mesa]] as part of the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] Philharmonic Society's series, [[San Diego]], [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], among many others. In addition, the orchestra plays a number of free community concerts throughout [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Georg Solti]] accepted the post in 1960, but resigned in 1961 without officially beginning his tenure.

===Conductor Laureate===
*2009–present [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]]

Before Salonen's last concert as Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic on April 19, 2009, the orchestra announced his appointment as its first ever ''Conductor Laureate'' "as acknowledgement of our profound gratitude to him and to signify our continuing connection."&lt;ref name="Conductor Laureate release"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.laphil.com/press/los-angeles-philharmonic-creates-new-honor-esa-pekka-salonen |title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Creates New Honor for Esa-Pekka Salonen |publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic |date=April 19, 2009 |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Salonen said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the Board asked me if I would accept the position of Conductor Laureate I was overwhelmed. This organization has been at the very center of my musical life for 17 years. I am very proud and honored that they would even consider me for such a prestigious title and it gives me great pleasure to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic will always play an important role in my life and this is a symbol of our continuing relationship." &lt;ref name="Conductor Laureate release"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Principal Guest Conductors===

*2005–2007 [[Leonard Slatkin]] (Hollywood Bowl)
*2008–2010 [[Bramwell Tovey]] (Hollywood Bowl)
*2017–  [[Susanna Mälkki]]
|}

Rattle and Tilson Thomas were named Principal Guest Conductor concurrently under [[Carlo Maria Giulini]], though Tilson Thomas's tenure ended much earlier. Until 2016, they were the only two conductors to officially hold the title as such (though as stated above, [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] was initially offered the position under Previn before having the offer withdrawn).

Beginning in the Summer of 2005, the Philharmonic created the new position of ''Principal Guest Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl''. [[Leonard Slatkin]] was initially given a two-year contract, and in 2007 he was given a one-year extension. In March 2008, [[Bramwell Tovey]] was named to the post for an initial two-year contract beginning Summer of 2008; he subsequently received a one-year extension.  After Tovey's term ended, no conductor has since held the position at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.laphil.com/press/press_detail.cfm?id=2004| publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic Association| title=Conductor Leonard Slatkin Opens Los Angeles Philharmonic's 2007 Season at Hollywood Bowl with Fireworks| date=10 July 2007| accessdate=2007-07-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205653/http://www.laphil.com/press/press_detail.cfm?id=2004| archivedate=27 September 2007| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Chris| last=Pasles| title=New conductors at Bowl Unveiled | work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/18/entertainment/et-bowl18| date=18 March 2000| accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the LA Phil announced that [[Susanna Mälkki]] would be the orchestra's third-ever Principal Guest Conductor beginning with the 2017-18 season. Her initial contract is for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://allisyar.com/2016/04/06/susanna-malkki-named-as-new-la-phil-principal-guest-conductor-and-i-say-huzzah/| title=Susanna Mälkki named as new LA Phil Principal Guest Conductor (and I say, "Huzzah!")| work=All is Yar| first=CK Dexter| last=Haven| date=April 6, 2016| accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other notable conductors===
Other conductors with whom the orchestra has had close ties include Sir [[John Barbirolli]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Leopold Stokowski]], [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]], [[Fritz Reiner]], and [[Erich Leinsdorf]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Donald| last=Muggeridge| url=http://www.idrs.org/publications/TWOboist/TWO.V5.2/LA.html| title=A History of the Los Angeles Philharmonic| journal=To the World's Oboists| publisher=The International Double Reed Society| volume=5| issue=2| year=1977| accessdate=2008-06-18| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205041637/http://www.idrs.org/publications/TWOboist/TWO.V5.2/LA.html| archivedate=2008-12-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently, others have included [[Kurt Sanderling]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Christoph Eschenbach]], and [[Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos]].

Many composers have conducted the Philharmonic in concerts and/or world premieres of their works, including [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[William Kraft]], [[John Harbison]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Steven Stucky]], [[John Williams]], [[Jerry Goldsmith]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Thomas Adès]], and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]].

A number of the Philharmonic's Assistant/Associate Conductors have gone on to have notable careers in their own rights. These include [[Lawrence Foster]], [[Calvin E. Simmons]], and [[William Kraft]] under Mehta, [[Sidney Harth]] and [[Myung-whun Chung]] under Giulini, [[Heiichiro Ohyama]] and [[David Alan Miller]] under Previn, and [[Grant Gershon]], [[Miguel Harth-Bedoya]], [[Kristjan Järvi]], and [[Alexander Mickelthwate]] under Salonen.  [[Lionel Bringuier]] was originally named Assistant Conductor under Salonen before being promoted to Associate Conductor and, finally, Resident Conductor under Dudamel; since then, [[Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla]] has served as Assistant Conductor and Associate Conductor under Dudamel.

==Other resident artists==

===Composers===
* 1981–1985:  [[William Kraft]]
* 1985–1988:  [[John Harbison]]
* 1987–1989:  [[Rand Steiger]]
* 1988–2009:  [[Steven Stucky]]
* 2009–present:  [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]

Kraft and Harbison held the title "Composer-in-Residence" as part of a [[Meet the Composer]] (MTC) sponsorship. Steiger was given the title "Composer-Fellow", serving as an assistant to both Harbison and Stucky.&lt;ref name="Green Umbrella 20"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.laphil.com/press/los-angeles-philharmonic-new-music-group-celebrates-20th-anniversary| publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic| accessdate=November 6, 2017| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group Celebrates 20th Anniversary| date=January 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stucky was also a MTC "Composer-in-Residence" from 1988–1992, but was kept on as "New Music Advisor" after his official MTC-sponsored tenure ended; in 2000, his title was again changed to "Consulting Composer for New Music."  In the end, his 21-year residency with the orchestra was the longest such relationship of any composer with an American orchestra.&lt;ref name="Green Umbrella 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.laphil.com/music/artist_detail.cfm?id=23| title=About the Composer:  Steven Stucky| publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic| accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams has been named the orchestra's "Creative Chair" beginning in Fall 2009.

===Artistic director and creative chairs for Jazz===
* 2002–2006: [[Dianne Reeves]]
* 2006–2010: [[Christian McBride]]
* 2010–    : [[Herbie Hancock]]

Reeves was named the first "Creative Chair for Jazz" in March 2002. Instead of just focusing on summer programming, the new position involved the scheduling of jazz programming and educational workshops year round; as such, she led the development of the subscription jazz series the orchestra offered when it moved into [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]. In addition, she was the first performer at the 2003 inaugural gala at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Her contract was initially for two years, and was subsequently renewed for an additional two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=L.A. Phil Names Jazz Leader| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Diane| last=Haithman| date=March 28, 2002| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/190429058/?terms=L.A.%2BPhil%2BNames%2BJazz%2BLeader| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McBride took over the position in 2006 for an initial two-year position that was subsequently renewed for an additional two years through to the start of the 2010 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2009, the orchestra introduced Hancock as McBride's eventual replacement.

In 1998, prior to the establishment of the Creative Chair for Jazz, [[John Clayton (bassist)|John Clayton]] was given the title "Artistic Director of Jazz" at the Hollywood Bowl for a three-year term beginning with the 1999 summer season. His band, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, acted as the resident jazz ensemble.&lt;ref name="Bernheimer"/&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Main|Los Angeles Philharmonic discography}}

The orchestra occasionally made 78-rpm recordings and LPs in the early years with [[Alfred Wallenstein]] and [[Leopold Stokowski]] for [[Capitol Records]], and began recording regularly in the 1960s, for [[Decca Records|London/Decca]], during the tenure of Zubin Mehta as music director. A healthy discography continued to grow with [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] on Deutsche Grammophon and [[André Previn]] on both Philips and Telarc Records. [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], and Sir [[Simon Rattle]] also made several recordings with the orchestra in the 1980s, adding to their rising international profile. In recent years, Esa-Pekka Salonen has led recording sessions for [[Sony]] and [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. A recording of the ''[[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]]'' by [[Béla Bartók]] released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 2007 was the first recording by [[Gustavo Dudamel]] conducting the LA Phil.

The Los Angeles Philharmonic performed the music in the pilot film of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', composed by [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]] and [[Glen A. Larson]]. The LA Philharmonic also performed the first North American concert for the popular ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' franchise game music, ''[[Final Fantasy concerts|Dear Friends: Music From Final Fantasy]]'' by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The orchestra has most recently recorded the sound track for the video game: ''[[BioShock 2]]'' as composed by [[Garry Schyman]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}
'''Medieval stained glass''' is the coloured and painted glass of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period [[stained glass]] windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in [[France in the Middle Ages|northern France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and [[England in the Middle Ages|England]], where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in [[Italy]], for example, [[fresco]]s were more common).

Stained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed.  The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though "portraits" and [[heraldry]] are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world. [[File:Vitrail Cathédrale Troyes 150208 01.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of a medieval window at [[Troyes Cathedral]], France (14th century)]]

==History ==
[[File:Süddeutscher Glasmaler 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The prophet Daniel from Augsburg Cathedral (c. 1065)]]

=== Early stained glass ===
Window glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow and Monkwearmouth]], and at other sites in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1992, 175&lt;/ref&gt; These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still ''in situ'' are thought to be the Prophet Windows in [[Augsburg Cathedral]], of c. 1065.

A useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the ''De Divers Artibus'' of [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be [[Roger of Helmarshausen]], a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Divers Artibus'' describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.

In the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in ''De coloribus et artibus Romanorum'', also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the ''Naturalis Historia'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] of c. 77AD.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of the arts, separately CS Smith and JG Hawthorne, translation of the Mappe Clavicula – introduction p4, Transactions of the American Phil. Soc., VOL 64 PT.4 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius&lt;ref&gt;Heyworth 1992, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the medieval period  the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor [[Cennino Cennini]], and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola&lt;ref&gt;1st ed De Re Metallica, as translated by (President) Herbert C. and (1st Lady) Lou Henry Hoover, The Mining Magazine, London, 1912, reprinted 1950 by the Dover Press, NY&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.

==Composition, manufacture and distribution ==

Prior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass ([[Forest glass]]). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.

The potash (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) found in [[Forest Glass]] was derived from wood ash. In ''De Divers Artibus'', Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne ''et al'' (eds.) 1979, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 57&lt;/ref&gt; As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.

Medieval stained glass panels could be created either by the [[cylinder blown sheet]] or [[crown glass (window)]] method.

Forest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
{{main|Glass colour}}
The colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with [[iron oxide]] being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, [[silica]] and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent colour====

Inherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

These colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and [[manganese oxide]]s which are naturally present in beech wood ash.

In the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:

In an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferrous) ions will become Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.

As the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.

Experimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple.&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1978, 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 143&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of [[Copper oxide (disambiguation)|copper oxide]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

====Deliberately added colourants====

[[File:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|thumb|Detail of a panel from [[Chartres Cathedral]]]]
[[File:England YorkMinster JesseTree c1170.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Jesse Tree panel from [[York Minster]]]]

Eraclius’ ''De Coloribus et Artibus'' includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times.  (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from ''De Divers Artibus''.)
As with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide results.

The production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 740&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval blue soda glass====

Early medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by [[forest glass]] after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found,&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt there must be many other examples.

Evidence of recycling [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[Mosaic|tesserae]] to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 743&lt;/ref&gt; Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.

Cox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flashing====
Glass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the [[cylinder blown sheet]] process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Azzoni et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied paint and silver stain===
[[Image:silver stain.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail showing use of applied paint and silver stain.]]

====Paint====
The paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 273&lt;/ref&gt; other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.

====Silver stain====
Producing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313).&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Silver stain was a combination of [[silver nitrate]] or [[silver sulphide]] blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 133&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">'''Monroe Curtis Beardsley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪər|d|z|l|i}}; December 10, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 18, 1985) was an [[American philosopher]] of art.

==Biography==
Beardsley was born and raised in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and educated at [[Yale University]] (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939), where he received the [[John Addison Porter]] Prize. He taught at a number of colleges and universities, including [[Mount Holyoke College]] and Yale University, but most of his career was spent at [[Swarthmore College]] (22 years) and [[Temple University]] (16 years). His wife and occasional coauthor, Elizabeth Lane Beardsley, was also a philosopher at Temple.

His work in [[aesthetics]] is best known for its championing of the [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] theory of art and the concept of aesthetic experience. Beardsley was elected president of the American Society for Aesthetics in 1956. He also wrote an introductory text on aesthetics and edited a well-regarded survey anthology of philosophy.

Among [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], Beardsley is known for two essays written with [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.|W.K. Wimsatt]], "The [[Intentional Fallacy]]" and "The Affective Fallacy," both key texts of [[New Criticism]].  His works also include: ''Practical Logic'' (1950), ''Aesthetics'' (1958), and ''Aesthetics: A Short History'' (1966). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife were over-all series editors for Prentice-Hall's "Foundations of Philosophy," a series of textbooks on different fields within philosophy, written in most cases by leading scholars in those fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">'''Odyssey Works''' is an interdisciplinary performance collective founded by [[Abraham Burickson]] and Matthew Purdon in San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotania.org/audio.html&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. The group, composed of artists practicing in various disciplines (writers, composers, designers, actors, performance artists etc.), creates 24hr performances for just one person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odysseyworks.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The group creates 24-36hr performances for one person audiences. According to the New York Times, "Odyssey Works tends to invite all manner of glancing comparisons: artists like Vito Acconci, Marina Abramović and Aaron Landsman; the interactive [[Punchdrunk]] play “[[Sleep No More (2011 play)|Sleep No More]]”; the notion of relational aesthetics; and the largely European trend of performing theater for one person at a time." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/design/odyssey-works-makes-art-for-and-about-one-person.html&lt;/ref&gt; The performances, which are site specific and highly participatory,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfweekly.com/2005-05-18/calendar/artists-without-borders/&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the [[Relational Esthetics|relational aesthetics]] movement in performance and art and find their roots in the [[Situationist International|situationist]] movement of the 1960s and the work of such directors as [[Jerzy Grotowski]] and [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jubilat.org/jubilat/archive/20/jubilat_interview/&lt;/ref&gt;

A book about Odyssey Works' ouvre will be published in the Fall of 2016 by [[Princeton Architectural Press]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papress.com/html/product.details.dna?isbn=9781616895150&lt;/ref&gt;

Odyssey Works is currently directed by [[Abraham Burickson]].

'''{{nihongo|''Ojime''|緒締め|extra=lit. "cord fastener"}}''' are a type of [[bead]] which originated in [[Japan]]. They were worn between the ''[[inrō]]'' and ''[[netsuke]]'' and are typically under an inch in length. Each is carved into a particular shape and image, similar to the ''netsuke'', though smaller.

'''Opera America''', officially '''OPERA America''', is a service organization promoting the creation, presentation, and enjoyment of [[opera]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operaamerica.org/applications/Membership/index.aspx Membership directory], Opera America&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all professional opera companies and some semi-professional companies in the United States are members of the organization including such opera companies as the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[San Francisco Opera]], [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], and [[Dallas Opera]]. Opera America also includes international affiliated opera companies such as the [[Theatro Municipal (São Paulo)|Theatro Municipal de São Paulo]]. Opera America also hosts businesses, educational institutions, libraries, foundations, guilds, and opera artists such as singers and composers. It is also the home of New York Children's Opera Studio.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The organization was founded in 1970 and has been led by President and CEO Marc A. Scorca since 1990.

In April 2014, advisers from Opera America worked with [[San Diego Opera]] to develop a plan to prevent the company's closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/apr/18/san-diego-opera-closure-postponed/|title=S.D.

Opera America's National Opera Center has two performance venues - Marc A. Scorca Hall and Plácido Domingo Hall. The National Opera Center has been the venue of performances by artists of companies such as Wolf Trap Opera. In 2016 and 2018, the Christman Opera Company premiered the operas ''Adriana McMannes'' and ''A Metamorphosis'' in Scorca Hall and Domingo Hall, respectively.[http://www.vocedimeche.reviews/2016/09/a-newborn-arrives.html][http://www.vocedimeche.reviews/2018/10/rachel-barg-sooyeon-kang-theodore.html][http://operawire.com/christman-opera-company-2018-review-adriana-mcmannes-a-metamorphosis/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">'''Physician, heal thyself''' ({{Lang-el|Ἰατρέ, θεράπευσον σεαυτόν}} — ''Iatre, therapeuson seauton''), sometimes quoted in the Latin form ''Medice, cura te ipsum'', is a [[proverb]] used in literary Classical texts from at least the 6th century BCE. The Greek dramatist [[Aeschylus]] refers to it in his ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', where the chorus comments to the suffering Prometheus, "like an unskilled doctor, fallen ill, you lose heart and cannot discover by which remedies to cure your own disease."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Weir Smyth, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html Theoi Classical Texts], lines 473–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The moral of the proverb in general, containing within itself also a criticism of hypocrisy, is to attend to one's own defects before those in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[E. D. Hirsch, Jr.]] |editor2=Joseph F. Kett |editor3=[[James Trefil]] |title=Physician, heal thyself |encyclopedia=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-618-22647-8 |oclc=50166721 |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/59/1/physicianhea.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715040956/http://www.bartleby.com/59/1/physicianhea.html |archivedate=2008-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning is underlined in the fable of [[The Frog and the Fox]] that was attributed to [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop]]. 

The same proverb also appeared in [[The Gospel According to Luke]], a Christian disciple who was a physician himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Colossians|4:14|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he quoted Jesus as making a similar reference: "No doubt you will quote the proverb to me, 'Physician, heal yourself!' and say, 'We have heard of all your doings at [[Capernaum]]; do the same here in your own home town'."&lt;ref&gt;NEB, Luke 4:23&lt;/ref&gt; At least one commentator has pointed out the echo of similar scepticism in the taunts that Jesus would ultimately hear while hanging on the cross: "He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him".&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Williams, ''The Gospel Narrative of Our Lord's Nativity Harmonized'', London 1844, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qnZjAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=He+saved+others;+himself+he+cannot+save++%22Physician%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5ubqFE34ss&amp;sig=lrRQKdmgZuDnlpkKNrre2pLcp2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQr_28p_neAhXNyqQKHfnsBpEQ6AEwBHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20saved%20others%3B%20himself%20he%20cannot%20save%20%20%22Physician%22&amp;f=false p.384]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar proverbs with a medical theme appear in other Jewish literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nolland |first=J. |date=1979 |title=Classical and Rabbinic Parallels to "Physician, Heal Yourself" |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=193–209 |isbn= |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Physician, Physician, Heal thine own limp!", for example, can be found in [[Genesis Rabbah]] 23:4.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, H., Simon, Maurice. ''Midrash Rabbah, Translated into English'', vol 1, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortened Latin form of the proverb, ''Cura te ipsum'', was made famous through the Latin translation of the Bible, the [[Vulgate]], and so gained currency across Europe.

'''Pointillé''' is a decorative technique in which patterns are formed on a surface by a means of punched dots.  The technique is similar to [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] or [[engraving]] but is done manually and does not cut into the surface being decorated.  Pointillé was commonly used to decorate arms and armor starting in the fifteenth century [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dect/hd_dect.htm].  The [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made in France at the end of the 14th century, has very fine and delicate pointillé work in gold.

== Common uses of pointillé ==

Pointillé is commonly used:

* in the decoration of metallic arms and armor
* in the decoration of hand-finished firearms
* in [[bookbinding]] to finish hand-made bookcovers [http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt2621.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">'''Rudolph Franz Zallinger''' (November 12, 1919 – August 1, 1995) was an American-based [[Austrians|Austrian]]-[[Russians|Russian]] artist notable for his mural ''[[The Age of Reptiles]]'' (1947) at [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. His painting of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' heavily influenced the creature design of [[Toho Studios]]' ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954). Two of Zallinger's dinosaurs, ''T. rex'' and ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', are seen in the film as part of a slide demonstration during a lecture in the [[National Diet Building]]. A third slide showing Zallinger's ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' was planned but eventually not used in the film.

==Biography==
Zallinger was born in [[Irkutsk]], [[Siberia]] in 1919. He attended [[Yale School of Art|Yale's School of Fine Arts]] on scholarships during the [[Great Depression]], was trained as an illustrator, and he taught at Yale after graduation. The Peabody Museum hired him to paint the mural in 1943 at $40 a week, and Zallinger took a crash course in paleontology to prepare for the job. The mural is one of the largest in the world, measuring 110 feet (33.5 meters) by 16 feet (4.9 meters). It required more than 4.5 years (1943–1947) to complete.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title =  Rudolph Franz Zallinger | url = http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/archives/biography/rudolph-franz-zallinger | publisher =Yale Peabody Museum: Collections : Archives | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the mural appeared on a United States postage stamp in 1970.&lt;ref name="Stamp"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = 1970 U.S. Postage Stamp Issues | url = http://www.1847us.com/ByYear/1970.htm | publisher =1847us.com  | date =2011  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After that, the museum appointed him as the “artist in residence”, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name="Wallace2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallace, D.R.|title=Beasts of Eden|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2004|isbn=0-520-23731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zallinger received many assignments, prominent among which are those he did for illustrating articles for [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazines. His paintings portrayed dinosaurs, the [[Russian Revolution]], the rain forests of Dutch Guiana (now [[Suriname]]) and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of ancient [[Crete]], besides others.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;

He taught at the Yale School of Fine Arts, the Hartford Art School at the University of Hartford in West Hartford, and at the Paier School of Art in Hamden.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;

==Other prominent works of Zallinger==
* ''The Age of Mammals'' — a {{convert|60|by|5|ft|m}} [[fresco-secco]] mural, painted from 1961 to 1967, now displayed on the south wall of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref name="AgeOfMammals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/exhibits/age-mammals-mural |title=The Age of Mammals mural|website=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elgar Symphony No 2 dedication page.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dedication page to Elgar's Symphony No. 2]]

[[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]]'s '''Symphony No. 2 in E{{music|flat}} major''', Op. 63, was completed on 28 February 1911 and was premiered at the London Musical Festival at the [[Queen's Hall]] by the Queen's Hall Orchestra on 24 May 1911 with the composer conducting. The work, which Elgar called "the passionate pilgrimage of the soul",&lt;ref name=grove&gt;McVeagh, Diana. "Elgar, Sir Edward", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08709 subscription access]. Retrieved 8 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was his last completed symphony; the composition of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Elgar/Payne)|Symphony No. 3]], begun in 1933, was cut short by his death in 1934.

The dedication reads:

{{quote|Dedicated to the memory of His late Majesty [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]. This Symphony, designed early in 1910 to be a loyal tribute, bears its present dedication with the gracious approval of His Majesty the King.&lt;ref name=score&gt;Elgar, Edward. "Symphony No. 2 in E-flat", (London: Novello and Company, Limited, 1911), dedication page.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The more personal nature of this work, however, is clear in a letter to friend and close correspondent Alice Stuart-Wortley, in which Elgar states:

{{quote|I have written out my soul in the [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|concerto]], Symphony No. 2 and the [[The Music Makers (Elgar)|Ode]] and you know it ... in these three works I have shewn myself.&lt;ref name=k70&gt;Kennedy (1970), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

== Composition and influences ==
{{quote|In every movement its form and above all its climax were clearly in Elgar's mind. Indeed, as he has often told me, it is the climax which he invariably settles first. But withal there is a great mass of fluctuating material which might fit into the work as it developed in his mind to finality – for it had been created in the same "oven" which had cast them all. Nothing satisfied him until itself and its context seemed, as he said, inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanford Terry, quoted in Christopher Mark, pp 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

These remarks, recounted by Elgar's friend [[Charles Sanford Terry (historian)|Charles Sanford Terry]], shed light on Elgar's creative process. Some sketches of the Symphony No. 2 date back to 1903, a letter from October of that year indicating an idea for a symphony in E-flat major to be dedicated to his friend and conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. The symphony was set aside during the composition of [[In the South (Alassio)|''In the South'']], [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1]], and the Violin Concerto.&lt;ref name="Meikle, p. 46"&gt;Meikle, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejected ideas from the latter work and earlier sketches joined the material Elgar began developing in late 1910 to complete the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, pp 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony's thematic material, like much of Elgar's work, consists of short, closely interrelated motives which he develops via repetition, sequential techniques, and subtle cross references.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Harmonically, the piece often borders on tonally ambiguous,&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; with the composer employing musical devices such as chromaticism and, in the third movement, a whole tone scale in order to heighten the feeling of tonal uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar also tends to emphasise a [[Tonic (music)|tonic-subdominant]] dichotomy rather than the more typical dominant; examples of this include the C minor Larghetto's second theme in F major, and the A{{music|flat}} major beginning to the first movement's [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The repetition of similar rhythm forms an essential part of the structural backbone of the piece, much in the manner of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, p., 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various large and small scale musical allusions, both obvious and implied, may be found throughout the work. Robert Meikle draws attention to the [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] treatment of the material in the last movement, as well as likenesses to Brahms's ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|A German Requiem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Meikle also notes the similarities to certain aspects of Brahms's [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 3]], in particular the cyclical return of thematic material and the subdued texture which concludes both works.&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The motive in the first violins at rehearsal 1 of the first movement, reappearing in both the rondo and the finale, resembles both Elgar's own so-called "Judgment" theme from ''The Dream of Gerontius'' and the ''[[Dies irae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; An inverted [[Tristan chord|chord]] appears at the conclusion of the work,&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and Allen Gimbel illustrates many possible links between this symphony and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', a work Elgar admired deeply.&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Gimbel points out the resemblance of the motive on the last three beats of m. 2 of the first movement and the [[Bar form|"Abgesang"]] of Walther's ''Prize Song'' from ''Die Meistersinger'',&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; thus linking the trials of the opera's hero to Elgar's desire to assert his independence as an artist.

== Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (1 doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn]], 2 [[Soprano clarinet|B{{music|flat}} clarinets]], [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 trumpets, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[tambourine]], [[cymbal]]s, 2 [[harp]]s, and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name=score /&gt;

== Analysis ==
=== First movement: ''Allegro vivace e nobilmente'' ===

The first movement is the longest of the four, running at approximately 17&amp;nbsp;minutes. The opening contains wide intervals in the strings and upper winds with upward leaps, thus allowing Elgar to create much expression and passion. Elgar himself described this movement as "tremendous in energy".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1970), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

It opens with what is known as the "Spirit of Delight" theme in E{{music|flat}} major, which reappears several times throughout the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1970), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After eight bars, a two-bar theme is introduced, followed by two more two-bar themes. A small bridging passage leads us to the second subject, a wistful tune played by the strings. Elgar was insistent that the first entrance of this new subject be played religiously ''pianissimo'' without sacrificing the expression dictated. This subject is formed from the repetition of a two-bar theme through a sequence that builds from ''pianissimo'' to ''fortissimo''. This then gives way to a slow, soft cello theme at rehearsal 11, featuring a song-like character. Throughout this section, the violas play a subtle accompaniment figure consisting of a quarter note moving up Diatonic and chromatically to an eighth note. This figure seems unimportant; however, it later goes on to become a major part of the heroic episode at rehearsal 20, interspersed with a trumpet call which bursts through triumphantly. The manipulation of these short motives serve as the basis of Elgar's composition in this movement. The brevity of this thematic material does not leave the listener feeling exhausted, as Elgar ties them up by closely relating each, resulting in a lengthy flowing development at rehearsal 24.

The opening melody of the development is made up of eerie diatonic and chromatic scales and is rather ambiguous, culminating in the appearance of what Elgar called the "ghost" motive in the violins at rehearsal 28.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A clearer and more grounded tune appears later in the cellos, commanding this section until the transformation into what appears to be a super-development. Elgar quickly thickens out the score and fills it with punctuating accents and six bars of downward leaps into the main theme, thus beginning the transition back into the primary material. This bridging section contains a break after the first bar of rehearsal 42 which gives the audience a chance to catch its breath before plunging into the recapitulation, which follows the standard outline. Following is a coda section at rehearsal 61, which introduces a short, calm section before uprooting the music with a surge of excitement and closing with a virtuosic ending.

=== Second movement: ''Larghetto'' ===

The second movement of the Symphony is a ''Larghetto'' funeral march in [[C minor]]. It has become popular belief that this movement is an elegy to [[Edward VII]], after whose death it was written. Many, including [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]], hold the belief that it is also a more personal expression of Elgar's grief, as he had lost close friends August Johannes Jaeger and [[Alfred Edward Rodewald]] around the time he was working on the symphony.

The movement is in sonata form without a development and is characterised by its manipulation of modal expectations.{{sfn|Harper-Scott|2007|p=199}} It opens with a seven-bar C minor introduction of soft chords in the strings, grouped into a 3+3+1 bar pattern which contrasts with the clear 4+4 grouping of the main theme's funeral march.&lt;ref&gt;Tovey, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The march tread of the movement is suggested beginning at bar 8 by a series of throbbing chords on beats two and four, pulsing in the string and drum accompaniment under the grave winds and brass melody. An unexpected welling of emotion is heard just before the March section closes at rehearsal 70, followed by a transitory passage featuring a "sigh" motive (rehearsal 70) in the woodwinds. This transition modulates to the second theme in F minor opens with a lyrical but subdued string episode at 71. Then, as if Elgar had lost his sense of restraint, we hear a build-up of dynamic, an increase in tempo, and more imaginative scoring leading to a triumphant F major climax in the brass, marked "Nobilmente e semplice" (rehearsal 76). The "sigh" figure is again heard in the closing thematic area at rehearsal 78, as if to recall earlier grief, slowly melting into the recapitulation of the C minor March theme at rehearsal 79.

The primary theme is now heard against a new countersubject in the oboe, resembling a solo lament of which Elgar, conducting, said:

{{quote|I want you to imagine a great crowd of silent people, watching the passing of a beloved sovereign. Strings, you must play those semiquaver figures of yours like the sigh of an immense crowd ... Oboe, I want you to play your lament entirely free, with all the expression you can get into it ...It must sound as if it belonged outside somewhere.{{sfn|Shore|1949|p=275}}|}}

The lyrical string second theme follows immediately at rehearsal 81 without a transition, this time in E{{music|flat}} major, the key of the "Spirit of Delight" theme. Everything follows according to sonata form convention until the coda (three bars after rehearsal 88), an extended Dominant (music)|V chord resolving to a warm and mournful return to C minor at rehearsal 89. An allusion to the introduction is then interrupted by an unexpected crescendo in the trombones and strings, quickly silenced as the movement ends with a decrescendo to ''[[Dynamics (music)|ppp]]''.

=== Third movement: Rondo ===

The third movement is the shortest of the four, running 8 to 9&amp;nbsp;minutes. Labelled a [[rondo]] by Elgar, it by no means adheres to the typical rondo archetype; Robert Meikle successfully analysed the movement's structure according to several different forms: two different rondos (the first ABACABA, the second ABACADABACA), a [[Scherzo|scherzo and trio]], and a sonata form.&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, "The True Foundation", 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lord-tennyson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]

The opening theme in [[C major]] is derived from a motif heard initially in the first movement (at rehearsal 1).&lt;ref&gt;Gimbel, "Elgar's Prize Song", 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring a recurring two [[Sixteenth note|sixteenth]]–[[eighth note]] rhythm and a sprightly character, it is traded between strings and woodwinds in quick successive units, maintaining a sense of rhythmic unrest through offbeat accompaniment patterns and [[hemiola]]s. A second sweeping theme in C minor begins at rehearsal 93, similar in contour and rhythm to the first movement motive mentioned above. Marked ''fortissimo'' and ''sonoramente'' in the strings, it is occasionally supplemented by winds and horns and punctuated by accented off-beats in the brass and timpani. This theme is then repeated ''piano'' by the first violins with interjecting woodwind solos. The opening material returns in fragments, running through a series of harmonic sequences and building to the entrance of the third theme at rehearsal 100, which maintains the sweeping aspects of the C minor section with the added rhythmic punch of the opening. This is followed by a return to the opening thematic material in earnest.

A pastoral theme appears at rehearsal 106 in the woodwinds, oscillating between a string motive related to the C minor theme and the opening material. Throughout this section, the timpani subtly foreshadows the coming strife with a repeated eighth note pattern played softly in the background. This action begins to intensify at rehearsal 118, with the return of the "ghost" motive from the first movement and the hammering of [[eighth note]]s in timpani, brass, high winds, and tambourine. It is a striking moment, a violent outburst in the midst of relative serenity; Elgar stated that it represented "the madness that attends the excess or abuse of passion", and tied it to a section of a [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] poem related to a corpse's experience in his grave ("...the hoofs of the horses beat, beat into my scalp and brain...").&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, "Symphony No. 2", 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode passes seemingly unnoticed, fading away before the recapitulation of earlier material, concluding with a triumphant C major [[Cadence (music)|cadence]].

=== Fourth movement: ''Moderato e maestoso'' ===
The fourth movement of the symphony, marked ''Moderato e maestoso'', is in a clear sonata form. The exposition opens with a primary theme in [[E-flat major]]; every bar has the same rhythmic pattern and the last beat of each bar ends with a downwards leap of a [[perfect fifth]]. An aggressive transitional theme at rehearsal 139 leads, through [[Sequence (music)|sequences]], to a ''grandioso'' climax (four bars before rehearsal 142), followed by a new theme in the dominant ([[B-flat major]]) at 142, marked ''Nobilmente'' like the climactic section of the second movement.

In large part, the development, beginning at 145, is a [[Fugue|fugato]] based on the transitional theme described above. It [[modulation (music)|modulates]] very little, centring essentially around [[D major]] and [[B minor]], calls for extreme orchestral virtuosity, and features very complex scoring. The climax of the section arrives at rehearsal 149 when the brass and percussion play a bar evoking the main theme and the trumpet hits a high [[B (musical note)|B]] that rings out over the entire orchestra. The score calls for a [[B (musical note)|B]] lasting only one bar, but, on one occasion, the trumpeter Ernest Hall held the note for two full bars. Elgar was so delighted that it has since become tradition to hold the B for the two bars.&lt;ref&gt;Tovey, "Essays in Musical Analysis", 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the development, new lyrical melodic material leads to a return of the main theme and a modulation back to E{{music|flat}} major. Thus, the recapitulation follows in fairly standard fashion at rehearsal 157; it brings back the same themes and firmly establishes E{{music|flat}} major.

The coda at rehearsal 167, marked ''più tranquillo'', again puts the main theme of the movement in the cellos and brings back the "Spirit of Delight" motive from the first movement, now heard in the woodwinds at a slower tempo at rehearsal 168.

The movement ends peacefully, and Elgar, who had premiered his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto to "endless ovations", is said to have been disappointed by the less generous reception of the Second Symphony. This could be in part because a quiet ending did not stir the audience into a wild show of appreciation but rather a more contemplative one, and in fact, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' gave it a warm review, stating, "the symphony was received with unhesitating and most cordial warmth".{{sfn|Shore|1949|p=263}}

== Extra-musical considerations ==
[[File:Tintagel-greenery.jpg|thumb|upright|The ruins of [[Tintagel]], [[Cornwall]], UK]]

There is much speculation as to who inspired Elgar to write this symphony. It was officially dedicated to Edward VII, who died in May 1910, but many scholars nonetheless believe his close friend Alice Stuart Wortley, with whom he was rumoured to have a romantic liaison, served as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Others tie the work to Elgar's grief over the death of his close friend Alfred E. Rodewald in 1903, as shortly thereafter, Elgar started sketching the ''Larghetto'' movement of the symphony.

Elgar told close friends that the symphony represented everything that had happened to him from April 1909 to February 1911, from the people he was with and the places he visited. During this time, Elgar visited [[Venice]] where he admired [[St. Mark's Basilica]] and its square, which, he later explained, inspired the opening of the ''Larghetto'' movement. Later in this period, he visited [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall in the southwest of England, spending time with Alice Stuart Wortley and her husband Charles. His friendship with Alice strengthened over the course of their many walks; Alice's daughter Clare later recalled one such stroll in the evening sun, the lyrical beauty of the countryside and the coastline engaging Elgar's interest. These events explain the words "Venice and Tintagel" inscribed at the bottom of Elgar's score.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1970), pp. 57–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another known inspiration for the piece is the poem "Song" by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], one of the last poems published before his death in 1822:

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;Rarely, rarely, comest thou, Spirit of Delight!
Wherefore hast thou left me now
Many a day and night?
Many a weary night and day
'Tis since thou art fled away.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe, "Song", "Columbia Granger's Poetry Database", EBSCOhost, [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=jgh&amp;AN=00000072814&amp;site=ehost-live subscription access]. Retrieved 29 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley by Curran, 1819.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]

The first line of this first stanza is written on the score, at the bottom of the first page. Elgar said, "To get near the mood of the symphony the whole of Shelley's poem may be read, but the music does not illustrate the whole of the poem, neither does the poem entirely elucidate the music."{{sfn|Lace|n.d.}}

Scholars speculate about the "Windflower" influence on this symphony, "Windflower" the affectionate nickname, inspired by Elgar's favourite buttercup flower, given to Alice Stuart Wortley by the composer. That Elgar and Alice were close friends is beyond question; the two kept in regular, frequent contact for several years. By virtue of Elgar's letters (the only side of their correspondence which survives), some suggest the composer harboured romantic feelings for the talented pianist and, furthermore, that his feelings may have been reciprocated.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Concrete evidence of such a relationship, however, does not exist; Alice and Charles Stuart Wortley were well-known music lovers, and several members of both the Elgar and Stuart Wortley families maintained close ties through visits and letters. Alice spent much time with Elgar during his visit to Tintagel, and Elgar clearly admired her; however, whether he thought of her as anything more than a friend and confidante is unknown. She may have served as some form of muse for the composer as he drew upon his time in Tintagel whilst writing his second symphony.

== Early reception ==
Elgar, though always prone to spells of intense self-doubt, had come to expect positive reactions to his new works. The premiere of Symphony No. 1 in 1908 was received enthusiastically by an exuberant audience and press; Elgar's name was linked with the likes of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and Brahms, and the work was performed 82 times over the following year.&lt;ref name="Meikle, p. 46"/&gt; Thus, Elgar was unpleasantly surprised by the very different reception given the premiere of his Symphony No. 2. The less-than-capacity filled hall responded to the new symphony, according to ''[[The Times]]'' reviewer, "with much favour, though with rather less enthusiasm than usual."&lt;ref name=times11&gt;"Elgar's New Symphony", ''[[The Times]]'', 25 May 1911, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for this perceived waning of interest could include the performance of ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'' and the Violin Concerto earlier the same week, the presence of two other composer-conductor premieres on the programme, or the high ticket prices. The emotional disconnect between an audience eager for the coronation of a new monarch and a brooding symphony in mournful commemoration of the late king may have also affected the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1987), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the lukewarm response prompted Elgar to remark to [[Henry Wood]] immediately upon exiting the stage, "Henry, they don't like it, they don't like it", and complain to [[William Henry Reed|W. H. Reed]] shortly thereafter, "they sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the symphony's premiere, Elgar was "despondent"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently entered "one of his periods of despair."&lt;ref&gt;Mark, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviews from that first performance were, however, generally positive. The critic of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' lauded Elgar's "firmer grip, not only of the symphonic form, but of the substance expressed within its confines."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1987), pp 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; This reviewer would also attest "there are heights here that hitherto even Elgar himself had not touched, but we are doubtful if the greater public will realise the fact immediately."&lt;ref name=k239&gt;Kennedy (1987), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic of ''The Times'' acclaimed the work as "a great deal better than his first", remarking that the second and fourth movements in particular "touch the composer's highest mark."&lt;ref name=times11 /&gt;

[[File:Leopold Stokowski LOC 26447u.jpg|thumb|upright|Leopold Stokowski]]

Reviews in the following year, however, were decidedly mixed. Elgar conducted the [[The Halle|Hallé Orchestra]] in a performance on 23 November 1911 eliciting the critic of ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' to declare "Elgar's original charm and his power of surprising us into wonder have diminished rather than grown as his craftsmanship and subtlety of fantastic variation have increased ... we can hardly say that the work contains any melody in the full sense of the word. Neither can we say with confidence that it quite vanquishes the impression of coldness and hardness." The American premiere in [[Cincinnati]] on 24 and 25 November by the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Leopold Stokowski]]&lt;ref name=k239/&gt; was not well received, and the American correspondent of ''The Times'' had this to say of a New York performance on 16 December: "One cannot listen to even the most eloquent pleading for nearly an hour without fatigue, and that was the first impression this music made – of restless, unpitying earnestness...not only is no concession made to the sensuously pleasing, but little regard is paid to the psychological need for contrast, for relief. It is a devotee exhorting a congregation assumed also to be devotees."&lt;ref&gt;"Elgar's Second Symphony in America", ''The Times'', 3 January 1912, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was slow to catch on, not performed a second time by the Hallé Orchestra, generally very supportive of Elgar's music, until 1926. The [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] performed the work in 1916 and not again until seven years later. In the wake of World War I, it did begin to stake its place in the repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1987), pp 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; A concert in March 1924, inspired the ''Times'' critic to remark upon the second movement: "one wondered whether any nobler or more beautiful funeral music has been written than this, which unrolls like some vast tapestry richly woven of purple and crimson threads."&lt;ref&gt;"British Broadcast Company's Concert: Elgar's Second Symphony". ''The Times'', 8 March 1924, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Boult]]'s rendering of the piece with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] on 16 March 1920 was received with "frantic enthusiasm,"&lt;ref&gt;Alice Elgar, quoted in Kennedy (1987), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; and stirred Elgar to declare, "I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Elgar, quoted in Kennedy (1987), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Elgar's Symphony No. 2, though regularly performed in the UK, is not a central part of the international symphonic repertory. Although Elgar is widely acknowledged as one of England's leading composers, his orchestral music, with the exception of the ''Enigma Variations'', the Cello Concerto, and his ''Pomp and Circumstance'' Marches, is only sporadically programmed outside Britain.

== Recordings ==
{{Main|Elgar Symphony No. 2 discography}}
The symphony was first recorded complete in 1927 by [[His Master's Voice]], part of the [[EMI]] group, conducted by the composer. This recording was later reissued on LP and later on CD. There was no further recording for eighteen years, until [[Sir Adrian Boult]] and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] made a recordings of the symphony in 1944. Since then there have been more than twenty-four new recordings. All the studio recordings of the symphony were made in the UK, until Sakari Oramo recorded the symphony with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for BIS in 2011. The non-British conductors who have recorded the work in the studio (they include [[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]], [[Giuseppe Sinopoli]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[André Previn]], [[Daniel Barenboim]] and [[Leonard Slatkin]]) have all done so with one of the London orchestras. Live performances from Russia and Australia have been recorded for CD, conducted by [[Yevgeny Svetlanov]] and [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] respectively. Of the British conductors, Boult recorded the work five times, and [[John Barbirolli|Sir John Barbirolli]] and [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Sir Andrew Davis]] have each made two recordings.

[[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]]'s "Building a Library" feature has broadcast comparative reviews of all available recordings of the symphony on three occasions since the 1980s. ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'', 2008, carries three pages of reviews of recordings of the work. The recordings given the top recommendation by both the BBC and ''The 'Penguin Guide'' are the 1975 [[Decca Records|Decca]] version by Solti and the London Philharmonic, coupled with the First Symphony, and the 1981 EMI recording by [[Vernon Handley]] with the same orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/radio3/search.pl?KEYWORD1=Elgar&amp;KEYWORD2=Symphony&amp;KEYWORD3=%09&amp;KEYWORD4=%09&amp;KEYWORD5=%09&amp;Search.x=0&amp;Search.y=0 Index to reviews] BBC Radio 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5734">The '''[[Organ symphony|Symphony for Organ]] No. 5''' in [[F minor]], Op. 42, No. 1, was composed by [[Charles-Marie Widor]] in [[1879 in music|1879]], with numerous revisions published by the composer in later years. The full symphony lasts for about 35 minutes.

 | title       = Widor: '''Symphonie pour orgue No. 5''', Op. 42, No. 1 – V. Toccata (conclusion)
 | description = Performed by Hans-Eberhard Roß
}}

==Structure==
The piece consists of five movements:
# Allegro vivace
# Allegro cantabile
# Andantino quasi allegretto
# Adagio
# Toccata

==Final movement==
The fifth movement, in F major, is often referred to as just '''Widor's Toccata''' because it is his most famous piece. It lasts around six minutes. Its fame in part comes from its frequent use as [[Wedding music|recessional music]] at festive Christmas and wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicfm.com/composers/widor/music/organ-symphony-no5-f-minor/ Classic FM - Charles-Marie Widor: Organ Symphony No.5 in F minor]. Accessed 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The melody of Widor's Toccata is based upon an arrangement of rapid [[staccato]] [[arpeggio]]s which form phrases, initially in F, moving in fifths through to C major, G major, etc. Each phrase consists of one bar. The melody is complemented by syncopated chords, forming an accented rhythm against the perpetual arpeggio [[motif (music)|motif]]. The phrases are contextualised by a descending bass line, often beginning with the 7th tone of each phrase key. For example, where the phrase consists of an arpeggio in C major, the bass line begins with a B-flat. The arpeggios eventually modulate through all twelve keys, until Widor brings the symphony to a close with '''''fff''''' block chords in the final three bars.

Following Widor's example, other composers adopted this style of [[toccata]] as a popular genre in French Romantic organ music, including notable examples from [[Eugène Gigout]], [[Léon Boëllmann]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Henri Mulet]], and [[Marcel Dupré]].

'''''The Scarecrow''''' is a 2013 animated [[short film]] and [[Advertising|advertisement]] by the American restaurant chain [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]]. The film features [[Fiona Apple]] singing a [[cover version]] of "[[Pure Imagination]]", originally performed by [[Gene Wilder]] as [[Willy Wonka]] in the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2013/09/chipotle-mexican-restaurants-animated-film-sustainable-food-marketing.html|title= What Does "The Scarecrow" Tell Us About Chipotle?|accessdate=September 25, 2013|date=September 23, 2013|first=Elizabeth|last=Weiss|work=[[The New Yorker]]|location=New York City|issn=0028-792X|oclc=320541675|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Fiona Apple 2012.png|thumb|left|[[Fiona Apple]] (''pictured in 2012'') performs "[[Pure Imagination]]".]]

In a [[dystopia]]n world,&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; the main character, Scarecrow, starts work at the "smoke-spewing" Crow Foods Incorporated. He sees a tube extracting a substance labeled "100% Beef-ish", but being marketed to consumers as "[[Natural foods|all natural]]". He then witnesses a [[robot]]ic crow injecting a chicken with green fluid to [[growth hormone|promote expansion]], followed by cows being held [[Captivity (animal)|captive]] in small metal boxes while machines continuously milk the cows forcefully.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Scarecrow returns to his small farm, seemingly upset by what he witnessed during the workday. He picks a red pepper, which inspires him to harvest other vegetables and open a burrito stand in the city. Above his stand is a banner that reads "Cultivate a Better World".&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

The computer-animated film features a [[cover version]] of "[[Pure Imagination]]" ([[Leslie Bricusse]], [[Anthony Newley]]) by [[Fiona Apple]],&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; a song originally performed by [[Gene Wilder]] as [[Willy Wonka]] in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971), itself an adaptation of [[Roald Dahl]]'s book, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964). According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Apple's performance "scores scenes of dark devastation" and offers "stark contrast between the world of pure imagination of the lyrics" and the animals being processed.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; In the film, when Scarecrow returns home from work and picks a red pepper, the song transitions from "mournful" and "menacing" to a "happier" tone.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Apple released the recording on [[iTunes]], with proceeds benefiting the [[nonprofit organization]], Chipotle Cultivation Foundation.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

''The Scarecrow'' ends with a brief teaser for a [[mobile app]] game available for [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s, where the player can take down the fictional Crow Foods.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/09/12/221736558/taking-down-big-food-is-the-name-of-chipotles-new-game|title=Taking Down Big Food Is the Name of Chipotle's New Game|accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=September 12, 2013|first=Eliza|last=Barclay|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipotle described the film as a "companion" piece to the game.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-fiona-apple-covers-willy-wonka-in-striking-new-chipotle-clip-20130913,0,6756902.story|title=Fiona Apple covers Willy Wonka in striking new Chipotle clip|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Randall|last=Roberts|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|location=Los Angeles, California|issn=0458-3035|oclc=3638237|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chief Marketing Officer]] Mark Crumpacker stated that because his company "is on a mission to change the way the world thinks of and eats fast food," they wished to inform the public about how the food they eat is raised. Brand Voice Lead William Espey added that they wanted to create "this experience, this film and mobile game that would help us support that mission."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ZOFIE5e4g&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=PLo5Sq8vGKhMOxUUOaMorLgYULnbwH7OeI|title=The Scarecrow – Behind the Scenes|work=[[YouTube]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpacker also stated that the film depicts the "elaborate facade that's been created by the [[Food industry|industrial food]] producers," who have done a "very good job of creating a rosy picture of their industry."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes/&gt; The film reflects Chipotle's marketing strategy of avoiding television advertising; the company's goal is to come across as an alternative to [[factory farming]] and a more "highbrow" option over other fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-interviews/cmo-crumpacker-chipotle-bucking-fast-food-model/233210/|title=Chipotle Bucks Fast-Food Convention While It Still Can|accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=March 12, 2012|first=Maureen|last=Morrison|work=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scarecrow'' was animated by Moonbot Studios, a small firm co-founded by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]] that won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=AdWeekSept12&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-chipotle-makes-magic-again-fiona-apple-and-dark-animated-film-152380|title=Ad of the Day: Chipotle Makes Magic Yet Again with Fiona Apple and a Dark Animated Film|work=[[Adweek]]|first=Tim|last=Nudd|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|location=|issn=|oclc=|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moonbot liked Chipotle's food and ethos and created a video centered around [[scarecrow]]s, which "normally protect food," but in this film they protect "something we call food, but it's something that seriously overproduced on a dramatic scale... which is not that far from the truth."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes/&gt; Co-directors Oldenburg and Limbert Fabian found inspiration from ''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'', as well as from [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournalSept19/&gt;

Chipotle originally selected [[Frank Ocean]] to perform "Pure Imagination" for the commercial, but he asked to be removed after the chain declined to remove its logo from the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beltrone|first1=Gabriel|title=Frank Ocean Gets the Last (Four-Letter) Word in Spat With Chipotle|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/frank-ocean-gets-last-four-letter-word-spat-chipotle-156232|website=Adweek|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately replaced by Fiona Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitehill|first1=Gaby|title=Fiona Apple claims Frank Ocean was due to sing Chipotle TV advert {{!}} Gigwise|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/84925/fiona-apple-claims-frank-ocean-was-due-to-sing-chipotle-tv-advert|website=gigwise.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Chipotle sued Ocean for the $212,500 advance that they had paid him to perform in the commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Miriam|title=Frank Ocean Sued by Chipotle Over Ad Deal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-ocean-sued-by-chipotle-over-ad-deal-20140308|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed later that month after Ocean repaid the advance in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Jason|title=Frank Ocean Settles Chipotle Lawsuit|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-ocean-settles-chipotle-lawsuit-with-curse-free-check-20140320|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short film was released on September 11, 2013.

''The Scarecrow'' has been praised as innovative marketing and a "beautiful" work of art.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; ''[[AdWeek]]'' felt that the effective animation and Apple's voice "connects the viewer emotionally to the story," but felt that it was "not quite as magical" as Chipotle's similarly-themed "Back to the Start" video.&lt;ref name=AdWeekSept12/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} Randall Roberts called the film surreal, direct and "visually magnetic", and wrote that "the song as covered by Apple is gorgeous, filled with electronic flourishes and rococo arrangements.

'''''The Swimming Hole''''' (also known as '''''Swimming''''' and '''''The Old Swimming Hole''''') is an 1884–85 painting by the American artist [[Thomas Eakins]] (1844–1916), [[List of works by Thomas Eakins|Goodrich catalog #190]], in the collection of the [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Executed in [[oil on canvas]], it depicts six men [[skinny dipping|swimming naked]] in a lake, and is considered a masterpiece of American painting.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=vii}} According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is "perhaps Eakins' most accomplished rendition of the nude figure",{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} and has been called "the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures".{{sfn|Goodrich|1982|p=239}} Since the [[Renaissance]], the human body has been considered both the [[Figure drawing|basis of artists' training]] and the most challenging subject to depict in art,{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=1}} and the nude was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form.

In this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] attitude to [[nudity]]: swimming naked was widely accepted,{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=305}} and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when [[Depictions of nudity|nudity was on display]]. ''The Swimming Hole'' develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of [[buttocks]] and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875) and ''[[William Rush and His Model|William Rush]]'' (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (''[[Taking the Count]]'', ''[[Salutat]]'', and ''[[Between Rounds]]'') and wrestlers (''[[Wrestlers (Eakins)|Wrestlers]]'').{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=306}}

Although the theme of male bathers was familiar in [[Western art history|Western art]], having been explored by artists from [[Michelangelo]] to [[Daumier]],{{sfn|Brown Price|1997|pp=56–63}} Eakins' treatment was novel in [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] at the time. ''The Swimming Hole'' has been "widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art".{{sfn|Figliano|2005}} In 2008, the art critic Tom Lubbock described Eakins' work as:

{{quote|a classic of American painting. It shows a scene of healthy, manly, outdoor activity: a group of young fellows having stripped off for a dip. It is based on the swimming excursions that were enjoyed by the artist and his students. Eakins himself appears in the water at bottom right—in signature position, so to speak."{{sfn|Lubbock|2008}}}}

== Title and composition ==
[[Image:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Gaul]],'' [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome. This [[Hellenistic]] work of the late third century BC is believed to have been a source for the reclining figure on the far left of the painting.{{sfn|Sewell|1982|p=90}}]]
Eakins referred to the painting as ''Swimming'' in 1885, and as ''The Swimmers'' in 1886. The title ''The Swimming Hole''&lt;!-- all in quotes - [[use–mention distinction]]--&gt; dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]]{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} Four years later, she titled the work ''The Old Swimming Hole'', in reference to the 1882 poem ''The Old Swimmin'-Hole''; by [[James Whitcomb Riley]].{{sfn|Adams|2005|pp=306–07}}{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=28–29}} The [[Amon Carter Museum]] has since returned to Eakins' original title, ''Swimming''.&lt;!--so why is the article called what its called--&gt;{{sfn|Amon Carter Museum|2007}}

The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at [[Dove Lake (Pennsylvania)|Dove Lake]], an artificial lake in [[Mill Creek (Montgomery County, Pennsylvania)|Mill Creek]] outside Philadelphia.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, "apparently lost in a contemplative moment".{{sfn|Berger|1997}} Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those&lt;!--not "men", since a dog is listed--&gt; depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): [[Talcott Williams]] (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c.&amp;nbsp;1865&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;1900), [[J. Laurie Wallace]] (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' [[Irish Setter]], c.&amp;nbsp;1880–90), George Reynolds (c.&amp;nbsp;1839–89), and Eakins himself.{{sfn|Berger|1997}} The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=1}} The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.
[[File:Bazille, Frédéric ~ Summer Scene, 1869, Oil on canvas Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frédéric Bazille]]. ''[[Scène d'été]]'', 1869, [[oil on canvas]], {{frac|62|1|4}} × {{frac|62|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in (158 × 159&amp;nbsp;cm), [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Eakins may have seen this painting while studying in Paris.{{sfn|Glueck|2004}}]] The composition is pyramidal. The figure reclining at left leads the viewer's eye to the seated figure, whose gesture in turn points to Godley at the apex of the compositional pyramid. The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting.{{sfn|Goodrich|1982|p=239}}{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|2006|p=285}} Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the [[Focus (optics)|focus]] of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with "virtually no moderating zones in between".{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=1–3}} The lighting within the picture is unnatural—too bright in some places, and too dark in others—although the effect, which tends to accentuate the body lines of the swimmers, is generally subtle.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=1–3}}

The composition is notable for both its adherence to [[Academy#Academies of the arts|academic tradition]] (the mastery of the figure as an end in itself), and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare in the history of Western art.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=1}} The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing "from reclining to sitting to standing to diving"; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=1}} As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a [[self-portrait]], here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in ''The Gross Clinic'' or ''[[Max Schmitt in a Single Scull]]'', here the artist's presence is more ambiguous—he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=66}} The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested;{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=66}} the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=25|ps=: Eakins himself said "There is so much beauty in reflections that it is generally worthwhile to try to get them right."}} This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism.{{sfn|Homer|1992|p=116}}

[[File:Thomas Eakins - Arcadia.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Eakins]]. [[Arcadia (painting)|''Arcadia'']], 1883, {{frac|38|5|8}} × 45 in (98 × 114 cm), oil on canvas, [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Like ''The Swimming Hole'', this painting shows the influence of a classical conceit.{{sfn|Sewell|Foster|2001|p=113}}]]

The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of [[Greek art]].{{sfn|Getty Museum|2008}} The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist.{{sfn|Sewell|1982|p=90}} It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture.{{sfn|Sewell|1982|pp=89–90}} One possible influence by a contemporary source was ''[[Scène d'été]]'', painted in 1869 by [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.{{sfn|Glueck|2004}}

In Eakins' oeuvre, ''The Swimming Hole'' was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of [[Phidias]]' Pan-Athenaic procession from the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon marbles]].{{sfn|Sewell|Foster|2001|p=113}} A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 ''[[Arcadia (painting)|Arcadia]]'', a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.{{sfn|Sewell|Foster|2001|p=113b|ps=: Eakins later gave the unfinished painting to [[William Merritt Chase]].}}

== Studies ==
Eakins made several on-site [[oil sketch]]es and photographic studies before painting ''The Swimming Hole''. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or vice versa (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).

By the early 1880s, Eakins was using photography to explore sequential movement and as a reference for painting.{{sfn|Homer|1992|pp=116, 141–45}} Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities.{{sfn|Getty Museum|2008}} Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to ''The Swimming Hole''. The swimmers are seen in the same spot and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. "The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may tell us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=21–22}} The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical "severity".{{sfn|Goodrich|1982|p=239}} Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.{{sfn|Sewell|Foster|2001|pp=235–36}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Eakins combined his studies into a final oil sketch in 1884, which became the basis for the finished painting. The basic composition remained unchanged, as all six men and the dog appeared in the sketch; however, Eakins, who usually adhered closely to his sketches when developing a final work, made several &lt;!--was ungainly previously: check that this doesn't mangle the meaning--&gt;uncharacteristic alterations to the specific movements and positions of the figures.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=19}} A friend and student, Charles Bregler, described the process:
{{quote|... For a picture&amp;nbsp;... like the ''Swimming Hole'', a small sketch was made 8 x 10&amp;nbsp;inches [20 x 25 cm], then separate studies of the landscape and figures, to get the true tone and color, etc. The diving figure being the most difficult to paint, was first modelled in wax. This gave him a thorough knowledge of every form.{{sfn|Sewell|1982|p=89}}}}

== Commission and reception ==
[[Image:Thomas Eakins circa 1882 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, c. 1882]]
The painting was commissioned in 1884 by [[Edward Hornor Coates]], a Philadelphia businessman who chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught. Coates intended to pay Eakins $800 ($&amp;nbsp;{{formatnum:{{inflation|US|800|1884|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), which at the time was the largest commission Eakins had been offered.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=13}}{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=15–16|ps=: At the time, Eakins' annual salary was $1,200 ($&amp;nbsp;{{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1200|1884|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).}}

Coates intended the painting for an exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and it was shown at the Academy's exhibition in the fall of 1885. However, Coates rejected it as unrepresentative of Eakins' oeuvre.{{sfn|Berger|1997}} In a November 27, 1885 letter to Eakins, Coates reasoned:
{{quote|as you will recall one of my chief ideas was to have from you a picture which ''might'' some day become part of the Academy collection. The present canvas is to me admirable in many ways but I am inclined to believe that some of the pictures you have are even more representative, and it has been suggested would be perhaps more acceptable for the purpose which I have always had in view. You must not suppose from this that I depreciate the present work—such is not the case.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=44}}}}

[[File:Hamilton Men I Have Painted 176f Edward H Coates.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of [[Edward Hornor Coates]], 10th President P.A.F.A.'' (1912) by [[John McLure Hamilton]], private collection.]]
It is not known precisely why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, it seems likely that Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=45}} Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=26}} Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from [[Haverford College]], where Coates studied as an undergraduate.{{sfn|Berger|1997}} The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=26}} Coates chose to exchange ''The Swimming Hole'' for the "less controversial genre scene" of Eakins' ''[[The Pathetic Song]]''—today housed in the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]]—{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.

On February 9, 1886, Eakins was forced to resign from the Academy because of his removal of a loincloth from a male model in a class where female students were present. In a letter to Coates on February 15 in which Eakins explained his reasons for resigning, he addressed the issue of nudity in his artwork:
{{quote|My figures at least are not a bunch of clothes with a head and hands sticking out but more nearly resemble the strong living bodies that most pictures show. And in the latter end of a life so spent in study, you at least can imagine that painting is with me a very serious study. That I have but little patience with the false modesty which is the greatest enemy to all figure painting. I see no impropriety in looking at the most beautiful of Nature's works, the naked figure. If there is impropriety, then just where does such impropriety begin? Is it wrong to look at a picture of a naked figure or at a statue? English ladies of the last generation thought so and avoided the statue galleries, but do so no longer. Or is it a question of sex? Should men make only the statues of men to be looked at by men, while the statues of women should be made by women to be looked at by women only? Should the he-painters draw the horses and bulls, and the she-painters like Rosa Bonheur the mares and cows? Must the poor old male body in the dissecting room be mutilated before Miss Prudery can dabble in his guts? ... Such indignities anger me. Can not anyone see into what contemptible inconsistencies such follies all lead? And how dangerous they are? My conscience is clear, and my suffering is past.{{sfn|Foster|2002}}}}

== Provenance ==
Following its rejection by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the [[Provenance|historical record]]—there is no further reference to the painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=4|ps=: "During the following three decades, likely no one beyond the painter's immediate circle of family and friends saw the painting. Nor is there any extant anecdotal or pictorial data to testify to the painter's sense of the work during these years&amp;nbsp;... The painting simply failed to register in any significant, public way during Eakins' lifetime."}} Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.

In 1925, ''The Swimming Hole'' was purchased from the artist's widow by the community of [[Fort Worth, Texas]] for $750 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|750|1925|r=-2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} Thereafter it was in the collection of the Fort Worth Art Association, the institutional predecessor of the [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]], and was displayed in the city's public library. In 1990, the museum announced it intended to sell the painting to build an endowment for the purchase of contemporary art.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} A public outcry ensued, prompting the museum to search for a local buyer. Eventually, after tumultuous negotiations, the [[Amon Carter Museum|Amon Carter Museum of American Art]] agreed to purchase ''The Swimming Hole'' for $10&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|10000000|1990|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{sfn|Reif|1990}}{{sfn|Kimmelman|1990}}

== Restorations ==
Before its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, ''The Swimming Hole'' appears to have&lt;!--concerned at certainty of "seven" here, but "may" in the next sentence--&gt; undergone seven different [[art restoration|conservatory treatments]].{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was [[lining of paintings|relined]] by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}} The [[Brooklyn Museum]] performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, ''The Swimming Hole'' received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.

Following its purchase by the Amon Carter, in June 1993, Claire M. Barry and staff from the Amon Carter and the [[Kimbell Art Museum]]s began a major restoration of the painting. According to Barry, "The restoration revealed relatively little significant damage or deterioration not previously visible. Several layers of discolored varnish and overpaint were removed, exposing a rich and varied surface with brushwork ranging from the controlled, almost miniaturistic strokes forming the figures to the freer treatment of the landscape elements."{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}}

Much effort went into distinguishing the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, was located in 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled to the painting.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}}

During the restoration, it was discovered that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 was the result of a misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a [[fugitive pigments|fugitive]] red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.{{sfn|Bolger|Barry|1994}}

== Interpretation ==
''The Swimming Hole'' represented the full range of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form.{{sfn|Sewell|Foster|2001|p=100}} [[Lloyd Goodrich]] (1897–1987) believed the work was "Eakins' most masterful use of the nude", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's "richest pieces of painting".{{sfn|Goodrich|1982|pp=239–40}} Another biographer, [[William Innes Homer]] (b.&amp;nbsp;1929), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, "it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature".{{sfn|Homer|1992|p=116}}

Before the mid-19th century, the subject of the nude male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting.{{sfn|Adams|2005|pp=305, 311}} Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=311}} Viewed in a broader context, ''The Swimming Hole'' has been cited as one of the few 19th-century American paintings that "engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition"—that of the male bather.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=83}} Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in ''Summer Scene'', [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]] (1859–91) (''[[Bathers at Asnières]]'', 1884) and [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=80–95|ps=: Bazille seems to have drawn back from his own more radical instincts, having first painted the figures in ''Summer Scene'' completely nude, before deciding to clothe them.}}
[[Image:George Bellows - Forty-two Kids, 1907.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Bellows]]. ''Forty-two Kids'', 1907, oil on canvas, [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].]]

Eakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of [[American realism|American realists]], particularly the artists of the [[Ashcan School]]. [[George Bellows]]' (1882–1925) ''Forty-two Kids'', painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to ''The Swimming Hole'', although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban [[Hudson River]] of New York City rather than in a rural setting.{{sfn|Turner|2003|pp=211–12}} In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting ''Forty-two Kids'': "Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately."{{sfn|Zurier|2006|p=216}}

Eakins' widow's retitling of the picture after his death reinforced the popular association with the nostalgic sentiment of Riley's poem.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=28–29}} More recently, the painting's subject has been compared to the poem "[[Song of Myself]]" by [[Walt Whitman]] (1819–92), particularly the section "[[s:en:Leaves of Grass/Book III#11|Twenty-Eight Young Men Bathe by the Shore]]", given the shared interest in the imagery of men bathing in the nude.{{sfn|Sewell|1982|p=90}}{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=7}} Whitman may have provided inspiration: the celebration of nudity, which in Whitman's case was an open expression of his homosexuality, informs the art of both men.{{sfn|Homer|1992|pp=116, 210–13|ps=: Several years after the painting was completed, Eakins and Whitman became friends, and in 1887 Eakins traveled to the poet's home in [[Camden, New Jersey]] to paint his portrait.}} In 1895, one of Eakins' male students reminisced about "us Whitman fellows", which has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality.{{sfn|Homer|1992|p=116}}{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=59}}{{sfn|Davis|1994}} "But for their marital status, however, virtually nothing concrete is known of the private realms or sexual propensities of any of the men depicted (in ''The Swimming Hole''), with the exception of Eakins."{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|p=59}}

[[Image:Dove Lake PA 7.jpg|right|thumb|Present-day [[Dove Lake, Pennsylvania|Dove Lake]]]]

Although the painting has been viewed as a [[Platonic love|platonic]] vision of the male nude seen unselfconsciously in a natural setting,{{sfn|Sewell|1982|p=100}} by the 1970s some American writers were beginning to see Eakins' work, and specifically ''The Swimming Hole'', as having homoerotic implications.{{sfn|Bolger|Cash|1996|pp=7–8|ps=: Refers specifically to {{harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=29}}, {{harvnb|Ellenzweig|2012|p=}},{{harvnb|Fried|1987|p=}}, and {{harvnb|Gopnik|1994|p=}} }} Critics have paid particular attention to the compositional prominence of the standing figure's buttocks, which has been interpreted as suggestive of "homoerotic interests".{{sfn|Adams|2005|pp=306–08}} According to Jonathan Weinberg, ''The Swimming Hole'' marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art.{{sfn|Adams|2005|pp=308–09|ps=: Referenced from {{harvnb|Weinberg|2004|pp=15-19}} }} Eakins left a record simultaneously provocative and ambiguous on matters of sex.&lt;!--what does that mean? No context--&gt; On the basis of the same visual evidence, that of the photographs, oil sketches, and the finished painting of swimmers, art historians have drawn markedly varying conclusions as to the artist's intent.{{sfn|Adams|2005|pp=308–09|ps=: Referenced from {{harvnb|Weinberg|2004|pp=15-19}} }}

__NOTOC__
'''Unitary urbanism''' ('''UU''') was the critique of ''[[status quo]]'' "[[urbanism]]", employed by the [[Letterist International]] and then further developed by the [[Situationist International]] between 1953 and 1960.

The [[praxis (process)|praxis]] originates from the [[Lettrist]] technique of [[hypergraphics]] which was applied to architecture by the Lettrist International (LI). The UU critique of [[urbanism]] was further developed in the 1950s by the LI, and consists of a range of practices that include, but are not limited to:
* The situation
* The [[dérive]] (drift)
* [[Psychogeography]]
* [[Détournement]]
* [[Industrial Painting|industrial painting]]
* [[Revolution]]

The critical practice continued to be developed by the Situationists and others. It was largely abandoned for the Debordian theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]] after the [[Second Situationist International]] and [[Situationist Antinational]] were formed. [[London]] based [[evoL PsychogeogrAphix]] is one of the few groups openly practicing unitary urbanism today.

Unitary urbanism was announced as a very specific praxis at the [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] platform between the Lettrist International and the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]. In his Address to the Alba Conference in September 1956, the Lettrist International Delegate [[Gil J Wolman]] said: "A unitary urbanism—the synthesis of art and technology that we call for—must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/wolman.html&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of urban practice was also called for in a tract distributed during a demonstration by Lettrists in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] in December 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/UU.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Guy Debord]] disagreed about the praxis, issuing the designation "the complex, ongoing activity which consciously recreates [[man]]'s [[urban environment|environment]] according to the most advanced conceptions in every domain," however the widening gulf between Nieuwenhuys' "structural" approach and Debord's focus on "content" eventually lead to Nieuwenhuy's split from the [[Situationist International|SI]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/ten-years-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unitary urbanism, one of the major early Situationist concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808190435/http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |archivedate=August 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stands on two tenets:
* The rejection of the standard [[Euclid]]ean, almost wholly functional, approach to urban architectural design, and
* The rejection of the compartmentalized way in which "art" is typically detached from its surroundings.

In the relative [[utopia]] of the UU ideal, the structural and artistic elements of human's [[metropolis|metropolitan]] surroundings are blended into such [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] that one cannot identify where function ends and play begins. The resulting [[society]], while it caters to fundamental needs, does so in an atmosphere of continual exploration, leisure, and stimulating ambience.

* [[Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies]]
* [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]]
* [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]]

==Quotes==
"'Whatever prestige the [[bourgeoisie]] may today be willing to grant to fragmentary or deliberately retrograde artistic tentatives, creation can now be nothing less than a synthesis aiming at the construction of entire atmospheres and styles of life.&amp;nbsp;... A unitary urbanism—the synthesis we call for, incorporating arts and technologies—must be created in accordance with new values of life, values which we now need to distinguish and disseminate.'"&lt;br&gt;—George Williams, "La plate-forme d’Alba"; originally appeared in Potlatch: Information Bulletin of the Lettrist International #27 (Paris, 2 November 1956), quoting  Gil J Wolman.

'''''White Fungus''''' is an art magazine and project based in [[Taichung]] City, [[Taiwan]]. Founded by brothers Ron and Mark Hanson in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 2004, as a quasi political manifesto, copies of the first issue were produced on a photocopier, wrapped in Christmas paper and hurled anonymously through the entrances of businesses throughout the city. Now a magazine featuring interviews, writing on art, new music, history and politics, ''White Fungus'' takes a dialogical approach to the work it covers. The name of the publication comes from a can of “white fungus” the Hansons found in their local supermarket in the industrial zone of Taichung City. Each cover of ''White Fungus'' is derived from a scan of the can.

''White Fungus'' has held interdisciplinary art events at galleries and venues including P.P.O.W. (New York), Kadist Art Foundation (San Francisco), N.K. (Berlin), The Lab (San Francisco), [[Taipei Contemporary Art Center]], the Cube (Taipei), Treasure Hill (Taipei),
[[VT Artsalon]] (Taipei), ARTSPACE (Auckland), Waikato Museum (Hamilton), [[Adam Art Gallery]] (Wellington), Enjoy Public Gallery(Wellington), and The Physics Room(Christchurch). The publication is held in library collections including The Museum of Modern Art (New York), The New York Public Library (Art &amp; Architecture Collection), The Southbank Centre (London), Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Taipei Fine Art Museum, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, National Library of Australia and [[Te Papa Tongarewa]] (National Museum of New Zealand). The magazine has included articles by notable New Zealand art writers and artists, including [[Tao Wells]].

''White Fungus'' was part of the exhibition ''Millennium Magazines'' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012. The exhibition was a survey of magazines made by contemporary artists since 2000. In November, 2012, White Fungus founders Ron Hanson and Mark Hanson gave a talk about the history of ''White Fungus'' at Times Museum in Guangzhou, China. In 2013 ''White Fungus'' was the magazine in residence at [[Kadist Art Foundation]] in San Francisco. While in the Bay Area, ''White Fungus'' released its 13th issue with events at Kadist and the Lab. The issue includes an article entitled 'The First Woman on Mars', written by American writer and independent scholar [[Ron Drummond]]. In late 2013 White Fungus signed a worldwide distribution deal with WhiteCirc in London.
