      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4197">'''Aeronomy''' is the meteorological science of the upper region of the Earth's or other planetary [[atmosphere|atmospheres]], which relates to the atmospheric motions, its chemical composition and properties, and the reaction to it from the environment from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Guy|last= Brasseur|pages=xi|title=''Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere : Chemistry and Physics of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere''||publisher=Springer |year=1984|ISBN=978-94-009-6403-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''aeronomy'' was introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Andrew F.|last= Nagy|pages=1–2 |title=''Comparative Aeronomy''|author2=Balogh, André|author3= Thomas E. Cravens|author4=Mendillo, Michael|author5=Mueller-Woodarg, Ingo|publisher=Springer |year=2008|ISBN=978-0-387-87824-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] in a [[Letter to the Editor]] of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' entitled ''Some Thoughts on Nomenclature'' in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Chapman, "Some Thoughts on Nomenclature," ''Nature'' '''157''', (1946): 405.  Available on-line at: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v157/n3987/abs/157405b0.html ''Nature''].&lt;/ref&gt; Studies within the subject also investigate the causes of  [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] or [[ionization]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Sydney|title=The Thermosphere - the Earth's Outermost Atmosphere|series= Physics of the Upper Atmosphere |year=1960|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-582050-9|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets. Aeronomy is a branch of [[atmospheric physics]].  Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and [[sounding rockets]] which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere.  [[Atmospheric tide]]s dominate the dynamics of the [[mesosphere]] and lower [[thermosphere]], essential to understanding the atmosphere as a whole.  Other phenomena studied are [[upper-atmospheric lightning]] discharges, such as [[Sprite (lightning)|red sprites]], sprite halos or blue jets.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Atmospheric tides==
{{Main|Atmospheric tide}}
[[Atmospheric tide]]s are global-scale periodic oscillations of the [[atmosphere]]. In many ways they are analogous to ocean [[tides]]. Atmospheric tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy input into the lower atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, while dominating the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  Therefore, learning about atmospheric tides is essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole.  Modeling and observations of atmospheric tides are needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper-atmospheric lightning==
[[File:Upperatmoslight1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Representation of upper-atmospheric lightning and electrical-discharge phenomena]]
{{Main|Upper-atmospheric lightning|Sprites (lightning)}}
[[Upper-atmospheric lightning]] or upper-atmospheric discharge are terms sometimes used by researchers to refer to a family of electrical-breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal [[lightning]]. The preferred current usage is '''[[transient luminous event]]s''' ('''TLEs''') to refer to the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena induced in the upper atmosphere by tropospheric lightning. TLEs includes red sprites, sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.&lt;ref&gt;Earle R. Williams (November 2001) "Sprites, elves, and glow discharge tubes," ''Physics Today'', '''54''' (11) :  41-47.

'''Aznavour Center''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://aznavourfoundation.org/en/aznavourcenter/ Aznavour Center]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Maison Charles Aznavour''', is a music centre in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], housing a technological and interactive museum about the life of [[Charles Aznavour]], and a cultural and educational center for youth. It was opened in 2011 by the ''Aznaviur Foundation'' to become the ''Residence of Charles Aznavour'' in Armenia. It occupies a five-story building near the top of the [[Yerevan Cascade]] and includes an open-air concert hall, as well as Aznavour's apartment and the museum itself. The current director of the Aznavour Center and Foundation is Christina Sargsyan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tert.am/en/news/2017/06/01/Kristina-sarkisyan/2389821 Aznavour Museum to host great singer to tell about his life – foundation director]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
French-Armenian singer [[Charles Aznavour]] cut the ribbon of the centre at the opening ceremony on October 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/a/24352450.html Երեւանում բացվեց Շառլ Ազնավուրի թանգարանը]&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and Armenian President [[Serzh Sargsyan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/news/5819-sarkozy-opens-charles-aznavour-museum-in-yerevan.html Sarkozy Opens Charles Aznavour Museum in Yerevan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112214307/http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/news/5819-sarkozy-opens-charles-aznavour-museum-in-yerevan.html |date=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition includes Aznavour's [[Gramophone record|discs]], [[album]]s, books, music awards, [[poster]]s and [[photography|photographs]].

The project was launched in 2007, funded by the Armenian government. Aznavour’s foundation decorated the interior of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/aznavour-erevan-317/ Museum of Charles Aznavour opens in Armenia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418011340/http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/aznavour-erevan-317/ |date=April 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">'''Bioconversion''', also known as ''biotransformation'', is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of [[cortisone]], which one step is the bioconversion of [[progesterone]] to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by ''[[Rhizopus nigricans]].'' Another example is the [[Bioconversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol|bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol]], which is part of scientific research for many decades.

Another example of bioconversion is the [[Conversion (chemistry)|conversion]] of [[organic material]]s, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain [[microorganism]]s, some [[detritivore]]s or [[enzyme]]s.

In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&amp;D for the [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of [[feedstock]] that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[sludge]], [[sewage]], etc.

==Three different processes for bioconversion==
1 -''' Enzymatic hydrolysis''' - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. [[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process.

2 - '''Synthesis gas fermentation''' - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is [[gasified]] in a closed environment into a [[syngas]] containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brienergy.com/|title=Clean Technology for Renewable Energy|website=www.brienergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria  (''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'') are used to convert the syngas ([[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co-generate excess electricity.

This type of engineered system introduces a substantial innovation represented by the automatic modulation of the treatment, able to adapt conditions of the system to the biology of the scavenger used, improving their performances and the power of this technology.

'''Business game''' (also called '''business simulation game''') refers to [[simulation game]]s that are used as an [[education]]al tool for teaching business. Business games may be carried out for various business training such as: general management, finance, organizational behaviour, human resources, etc. Often, the term "[[business simulation]]" is used with the same meaning.

A business game has been defined as "a game with a business environment that can lead to one or both of the following results: the training of players in business skills (hard and/or soft) or the evaluation of players' performances (quantitatively and/or qualitatively)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greco|first=Marco|author2=Baldissin, Nicola |author3=Nonino, Fabio |title=An Exploratory Taxonomy of Business Games|journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming|date=2013|volume=44|issue=5|pages=645–682|url=http://sag.sagepub.com/content/44/5/645.full.pdf+html|accessdate=4 May 2015|doi=10.1177/1046878113501464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business games are used as a [[teaching method]] in [[universities]], and more particularly in [[business schools]], but also for [[executive education]].

Simulation are considered to be an innovative learning method {{Harv|Aldrich|2004}}, and are often computer-based.

== History ==
Computer-supported business simulation originated from military war games and came into existence during the late 1950s {{Harv|Wells|1990}}. [[Business simulation game]]s, including non-computer-based board games and experiential activities, have since been used as a learning tool for teaching management {{Harv|Jackson|1959}} {{Harv|Andlinger|1958}}. It is regularly in use at Universities, and in particularly by major business schools. As an example, the [[University of Washington]] has been using business simulation game in classes since 1957 {{Harv|Saunders|1996|p=49}}.

The INTOP tool was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963, and was employed for teaching in 160 institutions worldwide over the period 1963–1995.  Its successor [[Intopia|INTOPIA]] was first released in 1995, and it has been used by universities in over 55 countries around the world, including 18 in the U.S.

Business games are also used within companies for management training and development {{Harv|Faria|1990}}.

'''Concordia University Texas''' is a [[Private university|private]], [[coeducational]] institution of [[liberal arts]] and [[sciences]] located in northwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. The university offers [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]] and online degrees as well as an Adult Degree Program for part-time and returning students.

Concordia University Texas is affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and is a member of the [[Concordia University System]], the nine-member association of LCMS colleges and universities. As a Lutheran university, Concordia's stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|url=http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527133142/http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/Univservices/Report/Section%203.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-27|publisher=Concordia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; mission is to develop [[Christian]] leaders.

==History==
[[File:Kilianhall.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Historic Kilian Hall]]
Concordia was founded in 1926 as '''Lutheran Concordia College of Texas''', a four-year [[high school]] that prepared young men for careers in ministry and teaching. The school opened with 26 students on its original site along East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]]) on the then northern outskirts of Austin, Texas. In 1929, a two-story classroom building, later called the Music Building, and still later known as College Central, was built.

Concordia was founded by members of [[Wends of Texas|Texas's Wendish]] immigrant community. The original main building, Kilian Hall, is named for the Wend [[John Kilian]], founder of the first Texas Lutheran church associated with the LCMS and leader of a large group of [[Sorbs|Wends]] (also called Sorbs) who settled in the [[Serbin, Texas|Serbin]] area. Today, between 10 and 15 percent of Concordia's faculty, staff and students are of Wendish heritage.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s many buildings were added to the campus, such as Hirschi Memorial Library in 1949 and Kramer Hall, the college's first fully air-conditioned classroom building, in 1950, but dedicated on February 25, 1951. Also in 1951, Concordia started using a two-year [[junior college]] curriculum.

[[File:Concordiaoldfacultypic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old photograph of Concordia faculty in front of Kilian Hall]]
Building developments on campus continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The campus built its chapel, named Birkmann Memorial Chapel, in 1952. Texas Hall, which housed dining services and faculty offices was dedicated in 1953. Studtmann Hall, an all-girl's dormitory opened in 1955. The first Beto Hall on the Concordia campus was built in 1969 and housed science labs. In the early 21st century, this building was converted into the school's mail services facility.

In 1955 Concordia admitted women as students for the first time and the institution changed its name to '''Concordia Lutheran College''' in 1965. In 1969, the four-year high school program was disbanded and Concordia’s curriculum expanded to four years after receiving permission to award Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1980.

Concordia joined the [[Concordia University System]] (CUS) in 1993. The CUS represents the ten colleges and universities run by the LCMS. In 1995, under the leadership of President Rev. Dr. David Zersen, the name of the institution was changed to '''Concordia University at Austin'''. The Accelerated Degree Program (ADP), with sites in Austin, [[Ft. Worth]], [[Houston]], and [[San Antonio]], within the College of Adult Education, was launched in 1995 to offer working adults the opportunity to earn a degree. Harms Hall, a dormitory, opened in January 2000 more than doubling campus resident capacity.The first Graduate program was developed during this period.

In 2002, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, a former fighter pilot and Colonel in the United States Air Force was named President of the university.

In 2007, Concordia University at Austin changed its name to '''Concordia University Texas'''.

In August 2008, Concordia University relocated its primary campus, moving onto more than {{convert|389|acre|ha}} in Northwest Austin. The city of Austin allowed the demolition of the former campus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/agenda/2007/hlc_032607.htm Historic Landmark Commission Regular Meeting March 26, 2007 - 7:00 PM]." ''City of Austin''. Accessed September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A developer bought the space with plans to construct a mixed-use development; however, the developer filed for bankruptcy in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427155030/http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |archivedate=2008-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:449487|title=Developing Stories|author=|date=|website=austinchronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new campus was dedicated on October 26, 2008.

==New campus==
In 2005, the Board of Regents approved the relocation of the Concordia University Texas campus. Since its founding the school had occupied a {{convert|23|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus near downtown Austin. The new campus is located in northwest Austin on {{convert|384|acre|ha}} of land. Construction began in the spring of 2007, and the new campus opened in September 2008.

The site for Concordia's new campus is the former [[Schlumberger]] Austin Systems Center. The site, formerly an R&amp;D facility, had six buildings connected by covered walkways and encircled by a nature trail. The six buildings, named by letter A-F, while extensively renovated, retained their basic design and features, including solid oak trim, large windows, sky lights and atria.

Three new structures were built prior to occupation of the new Concordia campus: student housing, a fieldhouse and a front entry/guard house. In addition to the new structures, 600 additional parking spaces and new roads were built to handle the increased traffic on the campus. In 2014, Concordia broke ground on a state-of-the-art softball field that was completed in 2016.

The campus includes a {{convert|250|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[nature preserve]] that has springs and wetlands, caves, dense trees and wildlife. A 10-A federal permit is required and only one other higher education institution carries one. The inclusion of the nature preserve allows Concordia to devote time to urban [[environmentalism]] in the Austin community. The Concordia University Nature Preserve is part of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a system of preserves in western [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] that provides habitat for a number of rare and endangered plant and animal species such the [[Golden-cheeked warbler]] and [[Black-capped vireo]], two rare species of [[songbird]]s that breed in [[Central Texas]].

In 2013, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, announced his retirement from Concordia University Texas. In 2014 Former Dean of the College of Business, Dr. Don Christian was named Chief Executive Officer.

'''Data Favela''' is a research institute founded in November 2013 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, by Celso Athayde, founder of Central Única das Favelas (''[[Cufa]]''), and Renato Meirelles, President of Data Popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novafavelabrasileira.com.br/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232635/http://www.novafavelabrasileira.com.br/# |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data Favela is the first research institute focused on the economic activity of Brazilian favelas, studying the behavior and consumption of its residents, and identifying business opportunities for external and internal parties who wish to develop operations in these territories. With its wide base of expertise and knowledge of Brazilian favelas and their markets, Data Favela trains the residents themselves to implement its research.

==Research==
There are 11.7 million people living in Brazilian favelas – the equivalent of the 5th largest state in Brazil, population wise. In 10 years alone, the proportion of middle class residents in the favelas has risen from 33 to 65% of their population. Indeed, the residents of favelas have a combined annual income of R$63.2 billion, the equivalent of the total consumption of countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia. Of this wealth, more than half is concentrated in the south-east of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2013/11/classe-media-na-favela-sobe-de-33-para-65-em-10-anos-diz-pesquisa.html|title=Classe média na favela sobe de 33% para 65% em 10 anos, diz pesquisa|date=4 November 2013|website=G1.globo.com|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design Studies''' is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that pursues a critical understanding of [[design]] and its effects through analytical and practical modes of inquiry. Its origins can be traced to [[design history]] where the field first got its start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Richard|title=Design Research and the New Learning|journal=Design Issues|date=2001|volume=17,|issue=4|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before slowly expanding to include larger themes and more varied subject matters. In that light, Victor Margolin, one of the founders of the discipline in the US, proposes Design Studies as a term that comprises various design researches and relates them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field, Design Studies references many scholarship paradigms and focuses on how design knowledge is developed, articulated and communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Design Research: A Disciplined Conversation|date=1999|volume=15|issue=02|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore incorporates an expansive set of evolving methodologies and theories that are drawn from key thinkers and theorists from the field itself (such as [[Victor Margolin]], Clive Dilnot, and [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]), but also from several related fields such as, the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[art]], [[Visual Studies|visual studies]], [[cultural studies]]), the [[social science]]s ([[anthropology]], [[political science]]s, and [[sociology]]), the [[science]]s ([[engineering]], [[Materials science|material]] studies, [[neurology]], [[technology]] studies). Design Studies also generates scholarly work in the fields of [[architecture]], [[urban planning]] and [[Urban policy|policy]], and spatial studies. Design Studies not only considers objects, places and systems, it investigates their meanings, contexts, possibilities and consequences.

Design Studies recognizes that design, as a practice, is merely one facet of a much larger paradigm. It examines, probes, and questions the role of design in shaping past and present personal and cultural values, especially in light of how they shape the future. The subjects of Design Studies are inherently fluid while being anchored to a core body of work and scholarship that revolves around broader themes such as [[ethics]], environmental sustainment, and [[social sustainability]].

The American author, editor and educator Susan Yelavich, encapsulates the terrain of Design Studies as embracing "two broad perspectives—one that focuses inward on the nature of design and one that looks outward to the circumstances that shape it, and conversely, the circumstances design changes, intentionally or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/double_profile_of_design_studie/|title=The Double Profile of Design Studies - Design Studies|website=adht.parsons.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of Design Studies ===
The history of the field of Design Studies can be traced to the early 1960s in England. In 1962, a “Conference on Design Methods” held in London led to the emergence of the [[Design Research Society]], bringing together academics and practitioners who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Forty Years of Design Research|journal=Design Studies|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about|website=Design Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a series of conferences were held that helped continue the development of the [http://www.drs2016.org/222/ Design Methods Movement (DMM)]— a product of the post-war optimism of the 1950s, cancelled in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement focused on the comparison between science and design and tried to determine methods that distinguished design as an important academic field apart from the realm of art and art history. However, in 1980 at the Design Research Society’s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005784314 Design:Science:Method] conference concluded that there was not much for design to learn from science, instead, science had something to learn from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, design became a discipline of study “based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them.” This stance was promulgated in the first issue of ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies]'' with the launch of a series of articles in its pages called “Design as a Discipline''.''”&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"/&gt; (''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies, The Interdisciplinary Journal of Design Research]'' as it is now known, was first published as Design Studies 1, no.1 in July 1979. Produced by the publisher Reed Elsevier known since 2015 as [[Elsevier]]). The series began with [[L. Bruce Archer|Bruce Archer]], and his 1979 essay, “Whatever became of Design Methodology?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying article from the same issue titled "The Three Rs," Archer places [[Design]] with a capital D as a third extreme in an education triangle with the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]] situating design, though not exclusively, within acts of configuration, composition, meaning, value, and purpose in man-made phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=The Three Rs|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the discipline of design and design research continued through the 1980s and were significantly reignited in 1995 when [[Victor Margolin]], an American scholar who contributed to the development of design history, argued for a new approach to “Design Studies.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|page=14|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin referred to the "dynamic crossings of intellectual boundaries" when describing the interdisciplinary nature of intellectual practice at the time. He felt that early design historians should question "whether design history as it [had] been constituted...[was] a viable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=v|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, J. V., “Design History in Britain From the 1970's to 2012: Context, Formation and Development, Ph.D. Dissertation University of Northumbria, Newcastle (January 2012) p. 200-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin defines design studies as a field of inquiry that addresses how we make and use products and how we have done so in the past. These products compromise the domain in the artificial. Design studies addresses ideas of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use. It considers these topics in the present as well as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=The Politics of the Artificial: essays on design and design studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin's position triggered counter arguments about how to characterize the study of design. A battle in print began with his article titled, “Design history or design studies: subject matter and methods” published in the international journal ''Design Studies (Design Studies was the journal of the [[Design Research Society]], founded in the UK in 1966; the journal itself has been in publication since 1979).'' This controversial topic had resonance in Britain where [[Adrian Forty]]’s response appeared in the pages of the ''[[Journal of Design History]]'', in which he argued in favor of research that led to the understanding of quality judgements defining good design "as an entirely legitimate field for design historical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEBATE: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Journal of Design History|date=1 January 1993|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this debate was made clear by the fact that it was reprinted in a special issue of ''[[Design Issues]]'' in 1995 where it refocused attention on "some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan, Doordan &amp; Margolin|first1=Richard, Dennis, Victor|title=Introduction|journal=v|date=Spring 1995|volume=11|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Design History to Design Studies started to occur as the research and approaches to the field began to focus on broader questions of meaning, authority and power, in other words, with the dynamics surrounding and enabling the practice of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|pages=38–42|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization came that Design History is only “but one component of what goes on in studying design, and to claim that all that is going on now could use the umbrella term 'design history’ is not tenable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|page=40|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of Design Studies would now include not only design history, but also allow for a dialogue about “issues of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use” in a historical and contemporary context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Foundational Figures ===
[[L. Bruce Archer]]. (1922-2005) was a British mechanical engineer and later Professor of [[Design Research]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] who championed research in design, and helped to establish design as an academic discipline. Archer trained a generation of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence and systematic analysis were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=A View of the Nature of Design Research Design:Science:Method|date=1981|publisher=Westbury House|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he helped to found the cross-disciplinary [[Design Research Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce, ‘A View of the Nature of Design Research’, in Jacques, R and Powell, J (eds), Design:Science:Method, Westbury House, Guildford, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian academic, Cameron Tonkinwise has a background in philosophy, with a particular emphasis on Heidegger's genealogy of thought and its informing design practice. Having worked closely with Tony Fry at the [http://www.changedesign.org/ Ecodesign Foundation] in the 1990s, Tonkinwise later headed initiatives in sustainability at Parsons, The New School, and later became chair of design studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where he set up the [https://design.cmu.edu/content/phd PhD programs] in [http://transitiondesign.net/ Transition Design] and Design Studies. Cameron's primary area of research is sustainable design and designing for socio-technical transitions - in particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership, i.e systems of shared use.

[[Adrian Forty]]: (born 1948) was Professor of Architectural History at The Bartlett, The Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London. Forty believed that the drive to define a new field, the field of Design Studies, was unnecessary due to the fact that the field of Design History had not exhausted all of its possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|title=Debate: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=''11|issue= 1|pages=16–18|doi=10.2307/1511611}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Objects of Desire''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26320994|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last=Forty|first=Adrian,|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=26320994}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores how consumer goods relate to larger issues of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Heskett]] (1937-2014) In the late 1970s, Heskett became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics) who helped develop the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader banner of Design Studies. In subsequent years, as design became a global practice increasingly valued by corporations and governments alike, design history became, along with design pedagogy, one of the nation's most successful academic exports. Heskett brought his deep knowledge of economics, politics and history to the project and worked alongside scholars from other disciplines to communicate the meaning and function of that increasingly important concept, "design", both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Margolin]] (DS-History) Considered one of the founders of Design Studies, Victor Margolin is Professor Emeritus of Design History at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He is a co-editor of the academic design journal, ''Design Issues'', and is the author, editor, or co-editor of a number of books including ''Design Discourse'', ''Discovering Design'', ''The Idea of Design'', ''The Designed World'', and ''The Politics of the Artificial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMU Design Lecture Series: How do you Design the Future|url=http://www.design.cmu.edu/designthefuture/victor-margolin/|accessdate=Oct 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Outside Anglo-Saxon ===
According to Ahmed Ansari, Danah Abdulla, Ece Canli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Matthew Kiem, Pedro Oliveira, Luiza Prado, and Tristan Schultz who make up the ''[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design Group]'', “Coloniality is not an abstract concept nor is it a subject to be examined from a comfortable distance. It is something that affects our communities, our countries and our peoples every single day. It is a continuous process of domination and violence to which we are submitted. It demeans our knowledge, subjugates our bodies, and renders our lives arduous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established via their online blog “[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design],” this collective of design researchers, academics, and practitioners working in and with the fields of Design Studies and Design Research firmly believe that “decolonisation is imperative for survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decolonising Design Group's effort was born from their frustrations with academia during the events that led up to their withdrawal from the 2016 Design Research Society Conference and driven by their desire to engage in a profound debate of the colonial ethos of design and research. The collective believes it is, “not sufficient for design studies and design research to simply include a greater ‘diversity of perspectives’ as a means to delay and offset demands for radical systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purpose of transforming the agenda of design studies and design research, the group organized a symposium on decolonization titled “Intersectional Perspectives on Design, Politics &amp; Power” which was held at the School of Arts and Communication, Malmö University, Sweden on 14–15 November 2016. For these [relatively] young academics, the field of design studies is not “geared towards delivering the kinds of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing the systemic problems that arise from the coloniality of power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Statement|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that design history and design research tends to have the most influence from the triad of Western Europe, North America, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Matthew|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford:|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect tends to be in line with the notion that history is written by the victors and thus design history is written by the economically powerful.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; They point to concurrent histories outside of the western context. For instance, Hong Kong has a unique system of design that was established prior to the economic growth of the Pearl River delta which can be found in the continuities of design in product types and styles, manufacturing and printing companies, and families of artist-designers.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; Or in Cuba for instance, where the origins of design was influenced by the crisis of “modern movement ideology and the ideologies oh how to escape underdevelopment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries lie on the periphery of the westernized view of design history and design studies and in some instances may have suffered in their adaptation of European modernity. As such, [[Gui Bonsiepe]], a German designer, teacher, and writer, suggested that “Decolonization in all its manifestations, economic, technological and cultural, should be the goal of project activity in the periphery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for understanding design as a global and multicultural phenomenon is also argued by Jonathan M. Woodham, [[Victor Margolin]], and Anna Calvera in Denise Whitehouse’s collection of essays.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=54–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together their aim is to “create a theoretical narrative that brings intellectual logic to the multiple stories of how different countries… have negotiated the process of Westernization and the idea of design according to their specific economic, geographical, political, and cultural circumstances.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Whitehouse points out, “While many countries produce local histories of design, the output is uneven and often driven by nationalist and trade agendas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Academic groups like the Japanese [http://www.designhistoryforum.org/ Design History Forum] and [http://www.ub.edu/icdhs/ The International Committee for Design History and Studies (ICDHS)] draw together both western and non-western, post-communist, postcolonial, Asian, and Southern Hemisphere, “to remap the scope and narrative concerns of design history.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Approaches and Scope ==
Design Studies thinks ambitiously about design, beyond its professional enclaves, and studies the significance and consequences of design activity in the modern world. It looks at design as a complex and multifarious activity and examines the forces that design exerts in, and on, the world—forces design sets in motion but does not control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|website=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Design Studies views design as both the embodiment of the imminent future (by virtue of behaviors it triggers and resources it depletes) and as a means of envisioning alternative futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Design Studies is interdisciplinary (moving between disciplines), multi-disciplinary (utilizing multiple disciplines in its process and methods) and transdisciplinary (combining disciplines in creating new disciplinary structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NC State|title=What is Design Studies, Anyway?|url=https://design.ncsu.edu/design-studies/|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its approaches and scopes are not constrained by any boundaries of academic disciplines. It is promiscuous and draws on the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, cultural theory, politics and the sciences to ask questions of what is design, and how can we comprehend its acting in the world by analyzing its possibilities and limits.

As an organized field of study, Design Studies is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourse and theoretical perspectives concerning the ways we think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It focuses on describing the why, the how and the what of design. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve and uses varied methodologies to explore the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, critical theory and design practice. Its scholars explore the coherent structures and intellectual parameters of how design is encountered in the world, as well as analyze which different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures.

== Subject(s) of Design Studies ==
As an organized field of study, Design Studies is a discipline concerned with design as a practice and as an intervention in the world. It is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourses and theoretical perspectives concerning ways to think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve by using various methodologies to analyze the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, design practice and critical theory.

Design Studies analyzes how different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures using approaches such as those conventions listed under [[design]] as well as:
* [[Aesthetics]]: Aesthetics in design refers to the visual attractiveness, in the context of beauty and taste, of a product. Studies have proven that creating good aesthetics in a product lead to better usability and user experience.
* [[Applied arts]]
* [[Architecture]]
* Biological design
* [[Participatory design#Co-design|Co-design]]

== Issues and Concepts in Design Studies ==
Design Studies asks us to think about the meaning of design. It studies the influence of designers and the effects design has on citizens and the environment.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268792485|title=Design studies : a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|others=Clark, Hazel., Brody, David Eric.|isbn=9781847882363|edition=English|location=Oxford|oclc=268792485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Margolin distinguishes a degree in Design from a degree in Design Studies by saying that “the former is about producing design, while the latter is about reflecting on design as it has been practiced, is currently practiced, and how it might be practiced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drs2016.org/009/|title=Design Research: What is it? What is it for?|website=DRS2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies urges to rethink design as a process, as a practice, and as a generator or products and systems that gives lives meaning and sustains our economic and political systems. Design thinking invites to explore the complexities inherent to the task of thinking about design.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt; Design Studies is concerned with the relationship between design and gender, design and race, and design and culture. It studies issues such as ethics, sustainment (social and environmental) and works with concepts such as agency and the artificial.

=== Issues ===

==== Ethics ====
Design has the capacity of structuring life in certain ways and thus design should result in the greater good for individuals and society but it doesn’t always do so. Ethics deals with how our actions affect others. Design Studies sees ethics as central to design. Tony Fry, a leading figure in Design Studies claims, “Design is quintessentially an ethical process but despite this recognition that ethics is integral to design in many ways, design ethics remains ‘massively underdeveloped and even in its crudest forms remains marginal within design education.” It is important to involve ethics in the design process, especially as the world we inhabit is increasingly becoming artificial.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

Clive Dilnot’s essay, [https://www.amazon.com/Design-Studies-Reader-Hazel-Clark/dp/1847882366 ''Ethics in Design –'' ''Ten Questions'']'','' explores why we need ethics in design, what is the relationship between design and ethics. Dilnot writes that ethics should as a responsibility, as the ability of the designer to address the public as citizens and not as consumers or as the infusing of “humane intelligence” into the made environment, assume the possibility of truly human – humane, sustainable ways or making and remaking the world.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

==== Sustainment: Environmental and Social ====

=== Concepts ===
==== The Artificial ====
Clive Dilnot goes further and clarifies that the artificial is by no means confined to technology. Today, it is combination of technical systems, the symbolic realm, including mind and the realm of our transformations and transmutations of nature. He gives the example of a [[genetically modified tomato]] that is neither purely natural nor purely artificial. It belongs rather to the extended realms of living things that are, as human beings ourselves are, a hybrid between these conditions – Neither nature nor the artificial nor the human are today pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858895940|title=Design as future-making|others=Yelavich, Susan,|isbn=9780857858399|location=London|oclc=858895940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies scholars also reference sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] when investigating the dynamics of the artificial. Latour's concept of [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT) portrays the social as an interdependent network of human individual actors and actants, which are non-human, non-individual entities. ANT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latour|first=Bruno|date=1996|title=On actor-network theory: A few clarifications|jstor=40878163|journal=Soziale Welt|volume=47|issue=4|pages=369–381|doi=10.2307/40878163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agency ====
Design plays a constitutive role in everyday life. We engage design with all of our senses – The things we see and read, the objects we use, and the places we inhabit are all designed. These products (all artificial because they are catalyzed by people) constitute an increasingly large part of the world. The built environment is the physical infrastructure that enables behavior, activity, routines, habits, and rituals, which affect our agency. Jamer Hunt defines the built environment as the combination of all design work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51931174|title=Strangely familiar : design and everyday life|date=2003|publisher=Walker Art Center|others=Blauvelt, Andrew, 1964-, Walker Art Center., Carnegie Museum of Art., Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse.|isbn=9780935640755|edition=1st|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|oclc=51931174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods  ==
=== Design Ethnography  ===

This form of research requires the scholar to partake in the use of, or observe others use, a designed object or system. Design-based Ethnography has become a common tool where design is observed as a social practice. It describes a process in which a researcher will partake in traditional observant style ethnography, and observe potential users complete activities that can inform design opportunities and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=5467|title=Design's Ethnographic Turn|work=Design Observer|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ethnographic techniques used by Design Studies scholars would fall more in line with anthropologists usage of the method. These techniques are observant and [[Participant observation|participant ethnography]]. The observant style requires the scholar to observe in an unobtrusive manner. Observations are recorded and further analyzed. The participant style requires the scholar to partake in the activities with their subject. This tactic enables the scholar to record what they see, but also what they themselves experience.

=== Actor-Network Theory  ===

While it remains a broader theory or concept Actor-Network theory can be used by Design Studies scholars as a research framework. When using this method, scholars will assess a designed object and consider the physical and nonphysical interactions which revolve around the object. The scholar will analyze what the object’s impact is on psychological, societal, economical, and political worlds. This widened viewpoint allows the researcher to explore and map out the objects many interactions, identify its role within the network, and in what ways it is connected to stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Callon M. (1986) The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle. In: Callon M., Law J., Rip A. (eds) Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics, Rhetorical Analysis, and Discourse Theory  ===

Design Studies scholars may also analyze or research a designed object or system by studying it in terms of images and their various meanings. Based in [[representation (arts)|representation]] and meaning-making, semiotics as pertinent design as an act of communication between the designer, the thing, and the user or users. This concept branches out into a rhetorical analysis of the designed thing. Scholars such as [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]], argue that design can be studied in such a way due to the existence of a design argument.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Richard|date=1985|title=Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=2|pages=4–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design argument is made up by the designer, the user, and the applicability to “practical life.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The scholar would pull these segments apart and thoroughly analyze each component and their interactions. Finally, [[discourse analysis]] or a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis]] can be adopted by the Design Studies scholar to further explore the above components. A Foucauldian approach specifically will analyze the power structures put in place, manipulated by, or used within a designed thing or object. This process can be particularly useful when the scholar intends to understand if the designed thing has agency or enables others to have agency.

The [[Design Research Society]] (DRS) is a learned society committed to promoting and developing design research. It is the longest established, multi-disciplinary worldwide society for the design research community. The Design Research Society was founded in the UK in 1966. The origins of the Society lie in the Conference on Design Methods, held in London in 1962, which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing. The purpose of the DRS, as embodied in its first statement of rules, was to promote ‘the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields'. The DRS Constitution states the Rules by which the society is governed. The Annual General Meeting reports detail the governance, finance, activities, and plans of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Design Research Society, Accessed November 12, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of '''exhibition catalogue''' (or '''exhibition catalog'''): a printed list of exhibits at an [[Art exhibition|art]] exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a [[trade fair]] or business-to-business event.

==Art or museum exhibition catalogues==
Catalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish [[hardcover]] "[[coffee table book]]". The advent of cheap colour-[[printing]] in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple "handlists" with several works to each page into large scale "descriptive catalogues" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers.  The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. 
  
In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.

===Format of art catalogues===
Book-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white).  There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages.  The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, [[bibliography]] and other [[critical apparatus]].  It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location.  The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher.  It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition.  Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness.  Nearly all are produced in [[paperback]]; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions.  Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade.  Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.
[[File:Bibliotheca Zriniana (Croatia) - katalog.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the 2008 [[Čakovec]] exhibition catalogue of ''[[Bibliotheca Zriniana]]'' library from 1662, owned by [[Nikola Zrinski]], Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia]]

In recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.  Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German [[States of Germany|lander]] to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak.  A typical example is the three-volume ''Die ''Parler'' und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern'' from [[Cologne]] of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition.  The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself.  Another example is ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.

This trend was led in Britain by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the USA by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.

===Japanese catalogues===
Japanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood-block]] artist [[Yasunori Taninaka]] is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, ''Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s'' is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.

The great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack [[ISBN]]s. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of [[Nakaji Yasui]] was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.

==Catalogues for trade fairs==
Exhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.

Many exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.

A typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: 
* Introduction and welcome message from the event organiser
* Floor plan showing the location of each exhibition stand
* Summary alphabetical list of exhibitors
* Exhibitor profiles (normally a textual description of each exhibitor plus their contact details)
* A ‘buyer’s guide’ where exhibitors are listed under relevant product or service categories
* Details of seminars or conference sessions running alongside the exhibition
* Advertisements promoting the exhibitors

The format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The [[London Book Fair]], SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] (Spielwarenmesse).

The exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.

Other common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

== Coefficient of Conservatism ==
Each plant species in a region is assigned a '''coefficient of conservatism''', also known as a C-value, ranging between 0 and 10.&lt;ref name=fqa95 /&gt; A plant species with a higher score (e.g. 10) has a ''lower'' tolerance to [[environmental degradation]] such as [[grazing]] or [[land development|development]] and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed, [[remnant natural area|remnant habitats]]. Non-native plants are either assigned a C-value of 0 or are excluded from assessments.&lt;ref name=freyman16&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freyman |first1=William A. |last2=Master |first2=Linda A. |last3=Packard |first3=Stephen |date=2016 |title=The Universal Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) Calculator: an online tool for ecological assessment and monitoring |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12491/abstract |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue= |pages=380-383 |doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12491 |access-date=2018-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chicago Region, 84% of the native plant species have a C-value of 4 or greater.&lt;ref name=FCR17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants with a C-value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land.&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

C-values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions. As of February 2018, there were at least 50 different FQA databases ranging from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] to western [[Washington (state)|Washington]], though most databases represented regions in the eastern and central United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=universalfqa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalfqa.org |title=Universal FQA|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mean C-value''' (&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated based on an inventory of plants. An area with a native mean C-value of 3.5  or higher likely has "sufficient floristic quality to be of at least marginal natural area quality."&lt;ref name=swink94 /&gt; Remnant natural areas with mean C-values of 4.0 or greater are [[environmental mitigation|unmitigable]].&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

== Floristic Quality Index ==
The '''Floristic Quality Index''' (FQI) is calculated by multiplying the mean C value by the square root of the total number of species:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Foot binding''' was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the [[Song dynasty]] until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called '''lotus feet'''.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the [[Song dynasty]], eventually spreading to all social classes by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women.&lt;ref name="lim" &gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Louisa |title=Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 |work=Morning Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.

There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu [[Kangxi Emperor]] tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns.  Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Yaoniang binding feet.jpg|thumb|200px|18th-century illustration showing Yao Niang binding her own feet]]

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the [[Southern Qi]] emperor [[Xiao Baojuan]], [[Pan Yunu]] (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that "lotus springs from her every step!" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms "golden lotus" or "lotus feet" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=32–34 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Emperor Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]], just before the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/alabaster/A1155872 |title=Chinese Foot Binding |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine {{Interlanguage link multi|Yao Niang|zh|3=窅娘}} to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=42 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=66u24WAyO_YC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body |page=203 |editor=Victoria Pitts-Taylor |publisher=Greenwood |date= 2008 |isbn=978-0-313-34145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/index.php/component/k2/item/10758-han-chinese-footbinding |title=Han Chinese Footbinding |work=Textile Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Ji 徐積 《詠蔡家婦》： 「但知勒四支，不知裹两足。」(translation: "knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); [[Su Shi]] 蘇軾 《菩薩蠻》：「塗香莫惜蓮承步，長愁羅襪凌波去；只見舞回風，都無行處踪。偷穿宮樣穩，並立雙趺困，纖妙說應難，須從掌上看。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period|author= Patricia Buckley  Ebrey|pages=37–39 |isbn= 9780520913486 |publisher=University of California Press |date=1 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; Soon after 1148,&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Bangji|zh|3=張邦基}} wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=111–115 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wenxian.fanren8.com/08/05/5/8.htm |title=墨庄漫录-宋-张邦基  8-卷八 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that "women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras."&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Morris (historian)|title=Why the West Rules - For Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNVrfoSubmIC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=978-1-55199-581-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Che Ruoshui|zh|3=车若水}} wrote the first known criticism of the practice: "Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small.

The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=187–191 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJHUFRTYpA4C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |pages=21–24 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called "toast to the golden lotus" and lasted until the late [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="shoe"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85995-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History |first=Patricia|last= Ebrey |page=196|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9781134442935 |date=2003-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other foreign visitors to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China mentioned the practice, including [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Marco Polo]] (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=55–56 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781134275427|date=2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"/&gt; The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming period]], the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry, but it was considered a status symbol.&lt;ref name="Rosenlee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee|title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA141|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8179-0|pages=141–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=37 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S.

[[File:Chaussure chinoise Saverne 02 05 2012 1.jpg|thumb|230px|A lotus shoe for bound feet. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (寸), which is around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in western measurement.]]

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader [[Hong Taiji]] declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYgQWAfHjmsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|author= Li-Hsiang, Lisa Rosenlee |page=144 |publisher= State University of New York Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7914-6750-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. 
By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to [[Hypergamy|marry into money]] in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the "Golden Lotus", being about three [[Cun (unit)|Chinese inches]] long (around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in Western measurement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mary Ellen|title=China's "Golden Lotus Feet" - Foot-binding Practice|url=http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=10 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031927/http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |author= Janell L. Carroll |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9X8EAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0-495-60499-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NieEnuWegkoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Film Review - Footbinding: Search for the Three Inch Golden Lotus |journal=Anthropologica |date=2004 |volume=48|issue=2|first=Laurel |last=Bossen |pages=301–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts.  In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in [[Yunnan]] Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

=== Demise ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYjGN4UM1mMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=27–29 |title=The Taiping Ideology: Its Sources, Interpretations, and Influences|author1=Vincent Yu-Chung Shih |author2=Yu-chung Shi |publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1968 |isbn=978-0-295-73957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBqr_MEn4m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=For Our Daughters: How Outstanding Women Worldwide Have Balanced Home and Career|author= Olivia Cox-Fill|page=57|publisher=Praeger Publishers |year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-275-95199-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, [[pamphleteering]], and lobbying of the Qing court.&lt;ref name="blake 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross-cultural Study of Women: A Comprehensive Guide|author= Mary I.

"  Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth.
Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited.
The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan--raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural [[Shanxi]] found that 18% of women had bound feet,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125800116737444883  |title=Bound by History: The Last of China's 'Lotus-Feet' Ladies |author= Simon Montlake |date = November 13, 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some remote rural areas such as [[Yunnan Province]] it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Favazza, Armando R.

Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called "cucumber foot" (''huanggua jiao'') due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some working women in [[Jiangsu]] made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural.&lt;ref name="blake 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |author=C Fred Blake|pages=327–329|editor= Bonnie G.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the [[Eight Banners]], did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance.&lt;ref name="manchu"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|title=The Manchu Way: the Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-3606-0|pages=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These "flower bowl" (花盆鞋) or "horse-hoof" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.&lt;ref name="manchu" /&gt;

}}

The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Beverley|title=Splendid Slippers: A Thousand Years of an Erotic Tradition |publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89815-957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3&amp;nbsp;m long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.
[[File:Bound feet (X-ray).jpg|thumb|An X-ray of two bound feet]]
[[File:FootBindingRxSchema2.gif|thumb|Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot]]

The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;

For most the bound feet eventually became numb.  However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful,&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|author= Margo DeMello |pages=116–117 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-313-33695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

=== Health issues ===
The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/21/china.gender |title= The ties that bind |first=Fraser|last= Newham|date= 21 March 2005 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, S. &amp; Stone, K. (1997) "Consequences of Foot Binding Among Older Women in Beijing China", in: ''American Journal of Public Health'' EBSCO Host. Oct 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Other issues that might arise from foot binding included paralysis and [[muscular atrophy]].&lt;ref name=body /&gt;

===Beauty and erotic appeal===
[[File:Woman with bound feet reclining on chaise lounge, China LCCN2001705601.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Bound feet were considered by some to be highly appealing]]
Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the [[Tang dynasty]] tale of [[Ye Xian]] written around 850 by [[Duan Chengshi]]. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of [[Cinderella]], and is thought to be one of its antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jruLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding: A Jungian Engagement with Chinese Culture and Psychology |author= Shirley See Yan Ma |pages=75&amp;ndash;78 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd |date=4 December 2009 |isbn=9781135190071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |title=Asian Origins of Cinderella: The Zhuang Storyteller of Guangxi |journal=Oral Tradition|volume=25|number=2 |first=Fay |last=Beauchamp |pages=447–496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vr81YoYK0c4C&amp;pg=PA160 |title='Cambridge Illustrated History of China|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=160–161|edition=2nd|isbn=9780521124331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet &amp;ndash; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called "golden lotuses") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called "silver lotuses" (4 Chinese inches) or "iron lotuses" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbJ3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Aesthetics of Dress |first= Ian |last=King |page=59 |isbn=9783319543222 |publisher=Springer|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.&lt;ref name="hill 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |page=56 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny "lotus shoes" and wrappings.  According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C. Till 1644 A.D |page=218|author=Robert Hans van Gulik |year=1961 |publisher= Brill |isbn= 9004039171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Levy however suggests that the barely revealed bound foot may also only function as an initial tease.&lt;ref name="hill 1"/&gt;

An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;  Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdKklZM9-kC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry|author= Armando R. Favazza | page=117|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|edition= third |date=2 May 2011|isbn=9781421401119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] considered footbinding to be a "perversion that corresponds to [[foot fetishism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacker|first1=Authur|title=China Illustrated|date=2012|publisher=Turtle Publishing|isbn=9781462906901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5JyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Confucianism===
[[File:A HIGH CASTE LADYS DAINTY LILY FEET.jpg|thumb|220px|A woman with her feet unwrapped]]

A common argument is that the revival of [[Confucianism]] as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the [[cult of widow chastity]], it also contributed to the development of footbinding.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"/&gt; According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the prominent Song Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by [[Lin Yutang]] among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that [[Zhu Xi]] also promoted footbinding in [[Fujian]] as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey|Patricia Ebrey]] suggests that this story might be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139|title= Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |author= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |date= April 2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6749-7 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA358|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|pages=358–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=丁传靖 编|title=《宋人轶事汇编》|location=北京|publisher=中华书局|date=1981|page=卷9，第2册，页455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foot-binding-and-ruism-confucianism_us_58c86e8fe4b01d0d473bceed |title=Foot-binding and Ruism (Confucianism)|date=16 March 2017 |author= Bin Song|work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Confucian scholars such as [[Tu Weiming]] also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confucian thought: selfhood as creative transformation|author= Tu Wei-ming|publisher= State University of New York Press|date= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not "injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.&lt;ref name="blake"/&gt; Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

Historian [[Dorothy Y. Ko|Dorothy Ko]] proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized.  Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on "Female Adornments" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings.  According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a [[Ming dynasty]] account that mentioned a proposal to "entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://womenshistory.osu.edu/sites/womenshistory.osu.edu/files/The%20Body%20as%20Attire.pdf |title=The Body as Attire: The Shifting Meanings of Footbinding in Seventeenth-Century China |journal=Journal of Women's History|volume =8|number= 4 |date= 1997 |pages= 8–27 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0171 |first=Dorothy|last= Ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Ko|title=Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nNcRiE-TKsC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2359-6|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Blake/pdfs/1994%20%20Foot-binding%20in%20Neo-Confucian%20China.pdf|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor | author=C.

===Feminist perspective===
{{Violence against women|sp=uk}}
Foot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |authors=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |page=139 | isbn=9780791481790|publisher= SUNY Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rophdLUYIjcC&amp;pg=PT246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Fan Hong|isbn=9781136303142 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423 |title=Ordinary Violence: Everyday Assaults against Women Worldwide|edition= 2nd|author= Mary White Stewart |pages=423–437 |publisher=Praeger|date=27 January 2014|isbn= 9781440829383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA310 |title=Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence, Volume 1 |editors= Claire M.

She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors.

===Other interpretations===

Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/12/unraveling-a-brutal-custom/ |title=Unraveling a brutal custom |author=Colleen Walsh |work=Harvard Gazette |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S. Major |publisher=Yale University Press |year= 2000 |isbn=978-0-300-07931-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |page=266 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature, film and television ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is not a place to list every novel that mentions footbinding, or a film or TV shows that happens to have a character with bound feet. --&gt;

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply [[wikt:condescension|condescension]] or [[wikt:contempt|contempt]] for China.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ebrey, "Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300–1890", ''Late Imperial China'' 20.2  (1999): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fumio Koizumi Prize''' ({{lang-ja|小泉文夫音楽賞}}) is an [[international]] [[award]] for achievements in [[ethnomusicology]], presented annually in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The prize is awarded by the Fumio Koizumi (小泉文夫) Trust each April 4, the date of Fumio's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/chosakue/index.html  List of publications of Koizumi Fumio]&lt;/ref&gt; The recipient receives an award certificate in addition to prize money. The winners must be present at the ceremony, deliver a prize lecture, and deliver another lecture at another Japanese university of his/her choice.

==Entry and prize consideration==
Nominations for the Fumio Koizumi Prize can be made only by the members of the Fumio Koizumi Prize [[Committee]]. The prize Committee consists of seven members, outstanding [[Japan]]ese scholars in [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]]. Committee designates independent [[expert]]s to evaluate each entry and discusses all the entries at the meeting, held in [[Tokyo]] in December. The winner can be a single scholar, of a group of scholars. The prize awarding ceremony is held in Tokyo, in April–May.

==History==
The '''Fumio Koizumi Trust''' was established by '''Koizumi Mieko''', widow of Professor '''Koizumi Fumio''' (1927–83), on October 11, 1989, to commemorate her husband's lifelong devotion to [[ethnomusicology]] and to honour individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions to this field. The first Fumio Koizumi Prize was awarded in 1989 to a British ethnomusicologist [[John Blacking]], and to Ethnomusicology Research Group of [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]. Up to now, 27 individuals and 2 groups have been awarded this prize. List of the winners of the prize together with the reasons for the award can be seen at the Fumio Koizumi Prize in Ethnomusicology Website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/index.html  List of winners of Fumio Koizumi Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 year onwards presented prize lecture texts are also placed on the prize website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">{{Redirect|HWV}}
The '''Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis''' (abbreviated as '''HWV''') is the '''Catalogue of Handel's Works'''. It was published in three volumes (in German) by [[Bernd Baselt]] between 1978 and 1986, and lists every piece of music known to have been written by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The catalogue also includes the first few bars of each piece and large amounts of factual information including manuscript sources, early prints, photographs, spurious works, etc. The catalogue does not include the full scores of Handel's works (for the full scores, see [[Händel-Gesellschaft]] and [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]).

==Numbering==
The HWV thematic catalogue serves as the modern numbering system for Handel's compositions. For example, Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' is numbered as HWV 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HWV numbers range from 1 to 612, however they do not represent a global date-ordering of composition; i.e. HWV 1 is not Handel's first work, nor is HWV 612 his last. Instead, the HWV numbers group works into musical categories, and provide a good ordering of the date of composition within each category. The following table lists the categories and the HWV number ranges.

|}

There are gaps and anomalies in the HWV numbering system, so the above table is only useful as a guide (see the [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel]] for more details).

The HWV numbers do not imply that Handel wrote exactly 612 works. The combination of unnumbered works, lost works, misattributed works, spurious works, variants (e.g. HWV 251 a–d), grouped works (e.g. HWV 229 1–7), and arrangements (e.g. HWV 482 1–4), all render meaningless the determination of the exact number of Handel's compositions.

The '''Institute for Biblical Research''' established in 1973 is "an organization of evangelical Christian scholars with specialties in Old and New Testament and in ancillary disciplines".&lt;ref name=about&gt;Institute for Biblical Research, Welcome page, [https://www.ibr-bbr.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It describes its vision as "to foster excellence in the pursuit of Biblical Studies within a faith environment."&lt;ref name=about/&gt;  It pursues these goals by means of publications, workshops and conferences.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==History==
The IBR was established under the leadership of [[E. Earle Ellis]], the organisation's founding chair from 1973 to 1981. The original intention was the establishment of a North American-based residential reference library similar to that of the Tyndale Fellowship for Biblical Research, [[Tyndale House]] Library, [[Cambridge]], England. From 1970 to its establishment, a number of scholars calling themselves the Tyndale Committee discussed the viability of creating a residential library, concluding that it would require an associated society, which came with the establishment of the IBR in 1973.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Institute for Biblical Research, Brief History, [https://www.ibr-bbr.org/brief-history-ibr]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, the IBR had 521 members composed of 412 Fellows, 41 Associates, 32 Friends and 36 Retired members.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Publications==
In 1989 the IBR launched the ''[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]]'' (BBR) under the editorship of [[Bruce Chilton]], published by [[Eisenbrauns]]. The current editor is [[Craig S. Keener]].

The ''BBR Supplement Series'' was established in 2007 and published monographs. Since 1992, Baker Book House published a series of IBR-sponsored bibliographies on topics such as the [[Historical Jesus]], [[Old Testament]] Introduction, [[New Testament]] Introduction, the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and the [[Pauline Letters]].

The '''International Planetarium Society, Inc.''' (IPS) is the global association of [[planetarium]] professionals. Its nearly 700 members come from [[List of planetariums|35 countries]] around the world. They represent schools, colleges and universities, museums, and public facilities of all sizes, including both fixed and portable planetariums. The primary goal of the Society is to encourage the sharing of ideas among its members through conferences, publications, and networking. By sharing their insights and creative work, IPS members become better planetarians.

IPS membership is open to anyone interested in planetariums. Members include directors, teachers, technicians, writers, artists, media specialists, digital artists and producers, presenters, vendors, scientists, students, and sponsors and friends of the planetarium dome and its starry sky.

More than 20 regional and national planetarium associations from around the world are affiliated with IPS. Representatives from those affiliates, together with the elected officers, make up the Executive Council, the ruling body of the organization.

== History&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=a_Engle1982 Historical Aspects of the International Planetarium Society]," Paul R. Engle, ''Planetarian'', Vol. 11 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=weinrich40year A Forty-year Perspective of the International Planetarium Society]," Dave Weinrich, ''Proceedings of the 47th Annual GLPA Conference'' in Champaign, Illinois, October 19–22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The genesis of what was to become the International Planetarium Society began with a meeting of planetarium educators in 1958 at the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), about 100 delegates from 67 facilities attended. The conference's proceedings were published as ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1958_cranbrook_proceedings.pdf Planetaria and Their Uses for Education]''.

Another meeting was sponsored by the NSF in 1960, this time in Cleveland, Ohio, and resulted in ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1960_cleveland_proceedings.pdf Planetariums and Their Uses for Education, Volume 2].'' At this meeting those attending voted to initiate a national planetarium association called the American Association of Planetarium Operators, but nothing came out of the action.

Regional associations of planetarium educators formed in the 1960s, resulting in the forming of GLPA, MAPS, SWAP, PPA, RMPA, and SWAP, and PAC was formed in Canada.

More than 300 planetarians gathered in 1970 at the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University in East Lansing at a meeting called CAPE - the Conference of Planetarium Educators. At this meeting the decision was made to organize a North American planetarium association and publish a journal. By-laws for the International Society of Planetarium Educators were approved in 1971, and the journal, ''Planetarian'', began in 1972. Paul Engle from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Planetarium became the first president, and the first editor was Frank C. Jettner from the Department of Astronomy at the State University of New York at Albany. Among the articles in the first issue was "Science and Communication" by Isaac Asimov.

== Early Planetarians ==
The planetarium field's earliest members were those who invented and modified the equipment used to project the stars onto the dome.
Among them are
* [[Walther Bauersfeld]], often called the "father" of planetariums, for his development of the Zeiss 1 model opto-mechanical projector in 1923
* [[Armand Spitz]], who developed an early inexpensive opto-mechanical projector
* [[Richard H. Emmons]], who helped establish more than 23 planetariums

== Awards ==
The highest award given by IPS is the '''Service Award''', started in 1982.

[[File:Third International Intersex Forum.jpg|thumb|300px|Participants at the third [[International Intersex Forum]], Malta, in December 2013]]
[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s, that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth, particularly when an intersex variation is visible. In some countries (particularly in Africa and Asia) this may include [[infanticide]], abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in [[East Africa]] may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a [[curse]].&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"/&gt;

Intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, may be surgically and/or hormonally altered to fit perceived more socially-acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes.&lt;ref name="apeg2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | title = Submission 88 to the Australian Senate inquiry on the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of people with disabilities in Australia | work = Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) | date = 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatments may involve sterilization.

Implementation of human rights protections in legislation and regulation has progressed more slowly. In 2011, [[Christiane Völling]] won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="voll" /&gt; In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] recognized for the first time a right for intersex persons to ''not'' undergo sex assignment treatment.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw nonconsensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Reuters| title = Surgery and Sterilization Scrapped in Malta's Benchmark LGBTI Law| work = The New York Times| date = 1 April 2015| url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/04/01/world/europe/01reuters-gay-rights-malta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Star Observer| authorlink = Star Observer | title = Malta passes law outlawing forced surgical intervention on intersex minors| work = Star Observer| date = 2 April 2015| url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/international-news-news/malta-passes-law-outlawing-forced-surgical-intervention-on-intersex-minors/134800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other human rights and legal issues include the right to life, protection from discrimination, access to justice and reparations, access to information, and legal recognition.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination, or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

==Intersex and human rights==
[[File:ILGA conference 2018 Intersex Awareness Day group photo.jpg|thumb|300px|ILGA conference 2018, group photo to mark [[Intersex Awareness Day]]]]
Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology,&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=  Stephen |last = Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=978-0306467592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]],&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

The [[Council of Europe]] highlights several areas of concern:

* unnecessary "normalising" treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* unnecessary medicalisation is said to also impact a right to life.
* inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law; facilitating access to justice and reparations.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* respecting self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights remains slow. These actions take place through legislation, regulation and court cases, detailed below.

=== "Pinkwashing" ===
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]". In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth. In some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, this may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse.&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39780214 | title = The midwife who saved intersex babies | first1 = Helen | last1 = Grady |first2 = Anne | last2 = Soy | work = BBC World Service, Kenya | date = May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]],&lt;ref name="cschrcl"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law| last2 = Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum| last3 = Rainbow Health Foundation| last4 = Sexual Minorities Uganda| last5 = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Uganda Report of Violations based on Sex Determination, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation| date = 2014| url = http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| access-date = 2017-05-14| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503012642/http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| archive-date = 2015-05-03| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]],&lt;ref name="76crimes" /&gt; [[Intersex rights in India|south Asia]],&lt;ref name="warne2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| issn = 1389-9155| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 227–236| last1 = Warne| first1 = Garry L.| last2 = Raza| first2 = Jamal| title = Disorders of sex development (DSDs), their presentation and management in different cultures| journal = Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders| date = September 2008| pmid=18633712| citeseerx = 10.1.1.469.9016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Intersex rights in China|China]].&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex| title = Intersex report from Hong Kong China, and for the UN Committee Against Torture: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment| date = October 2015| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2fCAT%2fCSS%2fHKG%2f22156&amp;Lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was reported that an intersex [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] adolescent, Muhadh Ishmael, was mutilated and later died.

Non-consensual medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people take place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been explored.&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt; Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions. In low and middle income countries, the cost of healthcare may limit access to necessary medical treatment at the same time that other individuals experience coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

Several rights have been stated as affected by stigmatization and coercive medical interventions on minors:
* the [[right to life]].&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;
* the [[right to privacy]], including a right to personal [[autonomy]] or self-determination regarding medical treatment.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;

===Human rights reports===
[[File:Small Ela Luk.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong intersex activist [[Small Luk]]]]
{{further|Intersex human rights reports}}
These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions. In 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics reported.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; In 2013, they included the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,&lt;ref name="untorture"/&gt; and the Australian Senate.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; In 2015 they included the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right ''not'' to undergo sex affirmation interventions.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

For [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, UN experts including the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee against Torture]], the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], along with the Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s called for an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex persons, including in medical settings. The experts also called for the investigation of human rights abuses, access to reparations, and the implementation of anti-discrimination measures:&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Citation| last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| authorlink = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |title = End violence and harmful medical practices on intersex children and adults, UN and regional experts urge| date = October 24, 2016| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&amp;LangID=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In countries around the world, intersex infants, children and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures in an attempt to forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies. When, as is frequently the case, these procedures are performed without the full, free and informed consent of the person concerned, they amount to violations of fundamental human rights...

States must, as a matter of urgency, prohibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on intersex children. They must uphold the autonomy of intersex adults and children and their rights to health, to physical and mental integrity, to live free from violence and harmful practices and to be free from torture and ill-treatment. Intersex children and their parents should be provided with support and counselling, including from peers.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt;}}

In 2017, the human rights non-governmental organizations [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty2017report"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Amnesty International| title = First, Do No Harm| date = 2017 | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/6086/2017/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty2017post"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Amnesty International| title = First, Do No Harm: ensuring the rights of children born intersex.| accessdate = 2017-05-13 | date = 2017 | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/05/intersex-rights/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-62313-502-7| last1 = Human Rights Watch| author1-link = Human Rights Watch | last2 = interACT | author2-link = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me| date = July 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Philippa| title = Interview: Intersex Babies Don't Need 'Fixing'| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2017b"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Human Rights Watch| title = US: Harmful Surgery on Intersex Children| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; published major reports on the rights of children with intersex conditions.

===Constitutional Court of Colombia===
{{main|Intersex rights in Colombia}}
Although not many cases of children with intersex conditions are available, a case taken to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] led to changes in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010–2011|volume=42|page=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case restricted the power of doctors and parents to decide surgical procedures on children's ambiguous genitalia after the age of five, while continuing to permit interventions on younger children. Due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obliged to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery if they have received accurate information, and cannot give consent after the child reaches the age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case led to the setting of legal guidelines for doctors' surgical practice on intersex children.

===Maltese legislation===
{{main|Intersex rights in Malta}}
In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions in a ''Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act''.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; The Act recognizes a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy, explicitly prohibiting modifications to children's sex characteristics for social factors:

{{quotation|14. (1) It shall be unlawful for medical practitioners or other professionals to conduct any sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of a minor which treatment and/or intervention can be deferred until the person to be treated can provide informed consent: Provided that such sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of the minor shall be conducted if the minor gives informed consent through the person exercising parental authority or the tutor of the minor.
(2) In exceptional circumstances treatment may be effected once agreement is reached between the Interdisciplinary Team and the persons exercising parental authority or tutor of the minor who is still unable to provide consent: Provided that medical intervention which is driven by social factors without the consent of the minor, will be in violation of this Act.&lt;ref name="gigesc"&gt;{{Citation| last = Malta| title = Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act: Final version| date = April 2015| url = http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26805&amp;l=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 2016, the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)|Ministry of Health]] of [[Intersex rights in Chile|Chile]] ordered the suspension of unnecessary normalization treatments for intersex children, including irreversible surgery, until they reach an age when they can make decisions on their own.&lt;ref name="Outright2016"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/chilean-government-stops-normalization-intersex-children | title = Chilean Government Stops the &amp;#039;Normalization&amp;#039; of Intersex Children | work = [[OutRight Action International]] | date = January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intersex Chile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilean Ministry of Health issues instructions stopping "normalising" interventions on intersex children|url=https://oii.org.au/30250/chilean-ministry-stops-normalising/|website=[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations were superseded in August 2016.&lt;ref name="inter2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Inter| first1 = Laura| last2 = Aoi| first2 = Hana| title = Circular 7 de 2016: Un paso atrás en la lucha por los Derechos Humanos de las personas intersexuales en Chile.

==Right to life==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] testing of [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the condition under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and requires [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. The technology allows discrimination against those with [[intersex]] traits.

[[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Carpenter]] highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the UK [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] of "serious" "genetic conditions" that may be de-selected, including [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], traits evident in elite women athletes and "the world's first openly [[Tony Briffa|intersex mayor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| author-link=Morgan Carpenter |title = Morgan Carpenter at LGBTI Human Rights in the Commonwealth conference| location = Glasgow| date = July 18, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| last2 = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]| title = Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007| location = Sydney| date = April 30, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory “sex selection” and “preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics”. Such de-selection or selective abortions are incompatible with ethics and human rights standards due to the discrimination perpetrated against intersex people on the basis of their sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

{{main|Discrimination against intersex people}}
A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people. [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref name="zagaz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf | title = Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005, Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town | date = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="com law"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | title = Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, No. 98, 2013, C2013A00098 | work = ComLaw | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of 'sex characteristics', through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt;  [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] listed as "sex characteristics"&lt;ref name="ilgaeurope"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/anti-discrimination-law-updated-bosnia-herzegovina | title = Anti-discrimination Law Updated in Bosnia-Herzegovina | work = [[ILGA-Europe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lezbelib.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lezbelib.com/europe-news/lgbti-people-are-now-better-protected-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina | title = LGBTI people are now better protected in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]] prohibits discrimination and hate crimes based on "sex characteristics", since 24 December 2015.&lt;ref name="et.gr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο"&gt;{{el icon}}{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/proti-fora-isoi-apenanti-ston-nomo | title = Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο| date = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
An Australian survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| volume = 16 | issue = 6 | date = March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Discrimination protection intersects with involuntary and coercive medical treatment. Maltese protections on grounds of [[sex characteristics]] provides explicit protection against unnecessary and harmful modifications to the sex characteristics of children.&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt;

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a statement explaining Section 1557 of the [[Affordable Care Act]] stating that the Act prohibits "discrimination on the basis of intersex traits or atypical sex characteristics" in publicly-funded healthcare, as part of a prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of sex".&lt;ref name="interacthealth"&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]| title = Federal Government Bans Discrimination Against Intersex People in Health Care| work = interactadvocates| accessdate = 2016-05-27| url = http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, many intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals.

Some intersex organizations claim that secrecy-based models have been perpetuated by a shift in clinical language to [[Disorders of sex development]]. [[Morgan Carpenter]] of [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] quotes the work of [[Miranda Fricker]] on "hermeneutical injustice" where, despite new legal protections from discrimination on grounds of intersex status, "someone with lived experience is unable to even make sense of their own social experiences" due to the deployment of clinical language and "no words to name the experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| title = Intersex and ageing| date = February 3, 2015 | url = https://oii.org.au/28385/intersex-and-ageing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is:

* firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; 
* secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and 
* thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population, but instead is about enabling an opt-in scheme for any individual who seeks it.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some jurisdictions, access to any form of identification document can be an issue.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Gender identities===
Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

===Access to identification documents===
Depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|journal=Reuters|date=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker.&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany's-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany's Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, in the case of ''Baby 'A' (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news| last = Migiro| first = Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Cite| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to the same rights as other men and women===
The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Binary categories===
Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

===Third categories===
The passports and identification documents of [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] and some other nationalities have adopted "X" as a valid third category besides "M" (male) and "F" (female), at least since 2003.&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008| pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|title=New Zealand Passports - Information about Changing Sex / Gender Identity|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as ''indeterminate gender'' on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | title = Third sex option on birth certificates | work = [[Deutsche Welle]] | date = 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | title = Sham package for Intersex: Leaving sex entry open is not an option | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rt.com/news/germany-allows-third-gender-062/ | title = 'X' gender: Germans no longer have to classify their kids as male or female | work = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach, and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

{{quotation|[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: “People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

The '''Joint Institute for Nuclear Research''' ('''JINR''', {{lang-ru|Объединённый институт ядерных исследований, ОИЯИ}}), in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]] (110&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Moscow]]), [[Russia]], is an international research center for [[Nuclear Science|nuclear sciences]], with 5500 staff members, 1200 [[researcher]]s including 1000 [[Ph.D]]s from eighteen member states (including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan). Most scientists, however, are eminent [[Russian scientists]].

The Institute has seven laboratories, each with its own specialisation: [[theoretical physics]], [[high energy physics]] (particle physics), [[heavy ion]] physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear reactions, [[neutron]] physics, and [[information technology]]. The institute has a division to study radiation and radiobiological research and other ad hoc experimental physics experiments.

Principal research instruments include a nuclotron superconductive [[particle accelerator]] (particle [[energy]]: 7 [[GeV]]), three isochronic cyclotrons (120, 145, 650 MeV), a phasotron (680 MeV) and a [[synchrophasotron]] (4 GeV). The site has a [[neutron]] fast-pulse [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] (1500MW pulse) with nineteen associated instruments receiving neutron beams.

==Founding==
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established on the basis of an agreement signed on March 26, 1956 in [[Moscow]] by representatives of the governments of the eleven founding countries, with a view to combining their scientific and material potential. The USSR contributed 50 percent, the People's Republic of China 20 percent. On February 1, 1957, JINR was registered by the [[United Nations]]. The Institute is located in [[Dubna]], 120 km north of [[Moscow]].

At the time of the creation of JINR, the Institute of Nuclear Problems (INP) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR already existed at the site of the future Dubna since the late 1940s, and it launched a program of fundamental and applied research at the [[synchrocyclotron]]. The Electrophysics Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (EFLAN) was established, and under the guidance of Academician [[Vladimir Veksler]], work began to create a new accelerator - a proton synchrophasotron - with a record energy of 10 GeV at that time.

By the mid-1950s, there was a worldwide consensus that nuclear science should be accessible and that only broad cooperation could ensure the progressive development of this research, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. Thus, in 1954, near CERN, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) was established. At about the same time, the countries that belonged to the socialist community decided to establish a Joint Institute for Nuclear Research on the basis of the INP and EFLAN.

The first director of the United Institute was Professor D. I. Blokhintsev, who just completed the creation of [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] the world's first nuclear power plant in [[Obninsk]]. The first vice-directors of JINR were professors [[Marian Danysz]] (Poland) and V. Votruba (Czechoslovakia).

The history of the formation of the United Institute is connected with the names of such prominent scientists and leaders of science as [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Igor Kurchatov]] , G. Nevodnichansky, AM Petrosyants, E. Slavsky, [[Igor Tamm]], A. V. Topchiev, H. Hulubey, L. Janos and others.

In the formation of the main scientific directions and the development of the Institute, outstanding physicists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newuc.jinr.ru/img_sections/file/pract08/30.06/JINR-eng-2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Intergovermental Organization Joint Institute for Nuclear Research |publisher=[[Laboratory of High Energies of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] |date=July 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823061058/http://newuc.jinr.ru/img_sections/file/pract08/30.06/JINR-eng-2008.pdf |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''Levitin effect''' refers to the phenomenon, first documented by Dr. [[Daniel J. Levitin]] in 1994, that people – even those without musical training – tend to remember [[song]]s in the correct [[key (music)|key]]. The finding stood in contrast to the large body of laboratory literature suggesting that such details of perceptual experience are lost during the process of [[memory]] encoding. In other words, laboratory experiments supported the idea that most people are incapable of any sort of [[absolute pitch]], and thus would remember melodies with [[relative pitch]]. Despite its status as a classic result in [[cognitive psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  author=D. J.

'''Liaison psychiatry''', also known as '''consultative psychiatry''' or '''consultation-liaison psychiatry''' is the branch of [[psychiatry]] that specialises in the interface between [[general medicine]] and psychiatry, usually taking place in a hospital or medical setting. The role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist is to see patients with comorbid medical conditions at the request of the treating medical or surgical consultant or team. Liaison psychiatry has areas of overlap with other disciplines including [[psychosomatic medicine]], [[health psychology]] and  [[neuropsychiatry]].

==Scope==

Liaison psychiatry usually provides a service to patients in a general medical hospital, either inpatients, outpatients or attenders at the [[Emergency Department]]. Referrals are made when the treating medical team has questions about a patient's mental health, or how that patient's mental health is affecting his or her care and treatment. Typical issues include:

* Patients with medical conditions that result in psychiatric or behavioural symptoms, such as [[delirium]].
* Supporting the management of patients with [[mental disorders]] who have been admitted for the treatment of medical problems.
* Assisting with assessment of the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] of a patient to consent to treatment.
* Patients who may report physical symptoms as a result of a [[mental disorder]], or patients with [[medically unexplained physical symptoms]].
* Patients who may not have a psychiatric disorder but are experiencing distress related to their medical problems.
* Patients who have attempted [[suicide]] or [[self-harm]].
* Assisting with the diagnosis, treatment and functional assessment of people with [[dementia]], including advice on discharge planning or the need for long-term care.

The psychiatric team "liaises" with many other services, including the treating medical team, other mental health services, social services, and community services. There is increasing interest on extending liaison psychiatry to primary care, for the management of long-term medical conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Liaison-psychiatry-faculty-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the Rapid Assessment, Interface and Discharge (RAID) model of liaison psychiatry — employed at [[City Hospital, Birmingham]] — estimated that the service saved between 43 and 64 beds per day through reduced lengths of stay and prevention of [[Hospital Readmission|readmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/37/1/4.abstract|title = Impact of an integrated rapid response psychiatric liaison team on quality improvement and cost savings: the Birmingham RAID model|last = Tadros|first = George|date = 2013|journal = Psychiatric Bulletin|accessdate = |doi = 10.1192/pb.bp.111.037366|last2 = Salama|first2 = Rafik A|last3 = Kingston|first3 = Paul|last4 = Mustafa|first4 = Nageen|last5 = Johnson|first5 = Eliza|last6 = Pannell|first6 = Rachel|last7 = Hashmi|first7 = Mahnaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[Centre for Mental Health]] published an [[economic evaluation]] of the service, estimating savings of around £3.5 million. This was followed in 2012 by the publication of a report recommending that every NHS hospital should have a liaison psychiatry service as standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/news/2012_liaison_psychiatry.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312051308/http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/news/2012_liaison_psychiatry.aspx |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of liaison psychiatry is partly a history of psychiatry and medicine. [[Galen]] was highly influential for over 1500 years in medicine particularly advocating the use of experimentation to advance knowledge. The polymath physician [[Avicenna]] produced many insights into medicine but only became influential in Western medicine when [[William Harvey]]'s elucidation of the circulatory system forced a re-evaluation of [[Galen]]'s work. The French philosopher [[René Descartes]] began the dualistic debate on the division between mind and body. [[Johann Christian August Heinroth]] is credited with the origination of the term psychosomatic illness. At the beginning of the 19th century [[Johann Christian Reil]] created the term psychiatry whilst the polymath [[Benjamin Rush]] wrote ''Diseases of the Mind''. The philosopher [[Spinoza]]'s concept of [[conation]], [[Mesmer]]'s development of [[hypnosis]] together with [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]]'s refinement of this technique influenced [[Sigmund Freud]] whose development of [[psychoanalytic theory]] was to have a profound impact on the development of liaison psychiatry. Under the guidance of Alan Gregg, psychoanalysis impacted on hospital medicine through figures such as [[Franz Alexander]], [[Stanley Cobb]] and Felix Deutsch.

Edward Billings first coined the term "liaison psychiatry." The publishing of two texts ''A Handbook of Elementary Psychobiology and Psychiatry'', by Billings, and ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', by Edward Weiss and O Spurgeon English, outlined the theoretical foundations for the developing field. [[George L. Engel]] is considered to have been one of the most important figures in the development of liaison psychiatry and coined the term "Biopsychosocial Model" which overcame divisions created by Cartesian Dualism and was to have wider repercussions on psychiatric practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==United Kingdom==

The Faculty of Liaison Psychiatry was established within the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] in 1997. The European Association for Consultation Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics also produced a set of guidelines for training in Liaison Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpsychores.com/article/PIIS0022399906005034/fulltext | title=EACLPP Training Guidelines |accessdate=2008-07-05|publisher=EACLPP.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychiatric Association]] formally recognized C-L psychiatry as a subspecialty in 2004, with its own sub-specialty board exam. The profession debated about the best term for this specialty, finally settling on "Psychosomatic Medicine".

A survey for [[NHS England]] in 2015 found 133 out of 179 A&amp;E departments could not deliver the minimum core standard for 24/7 liaison psychiatry.  11 hospitals had no liaison psychiatry service, and only 35 delivered at or above the minimum standards. Collectively there was a shortage of 1,270 trained nurses and 230 trained consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Majority of A&amp;E departments fail liaison psychiatry standards|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/mental-health/exclusive-majority-of-ae-departments-fail-liaison-psychiatry-standards/5091552.article|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Little Ivy derives from these schools' small student bodies, standards of academic excellence, associated historic social prestige, and highly selective admissions comparable to the [[Ivy League]]. According to ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', the Little Ivies are also known for their large [[financial endowment]]s, both absolutely and relative to their size.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/little-good-news-for-the-little-ivies|title=The Little Ivies’ Endowments Took a Big Hit This Year|last=McDonald|first=Michael|date=December 22, 2016|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=April 18, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is generally associated with the colleges of the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]] (NESCAC) and select schools from the [[Liberty League]], [[Patriot League]] and the [[Centennial Conference]].

'''Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies named after M.V. Lomonosov''' (traditional abbreviation "MITHT") is one of the oldest universities in the country that offer training in a wide range of specialties in the field of [[chemical technology]].

Currently, there are more than 4,500 students in nine areas of undergraduate, 28 master's programs and 23 scientific specialties for training of candidates and doctors of science. In MITHT there are 8 dissertation councils for doctoral and PhD theses.

Research and teaching activities are performed by more than 400 professors and 158 scientists, including more than 120 doctors of science and professors. Located in Moscow at Vernadsky Avenue, Building 86 (new building complex) and Malaya Pirogovskaya, Building 1 (historic building).

== History ==

History of the University and its continuing operations as a higher education institution begins 1 July 1900 and covers several stages.

=== Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow Higher Women Courses (1900–1918) ===
1 July (14 July, [[New Style]]) 1900 was organized the [[Moscow Higher Women Courses]] (MHWC). Their structure originally consisted of two departments: History and Philosophy and [[Physics]] and Mathematics. On the last one were soon opened two offices: mathematical and natural, and after a few years two more – medical and chemical-pharmaceutical. The initiators and the first lecturers were outstanding scientists, academics subsequently [[Sergey Chaplygin|S. A. Chaplygin]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky|V. I. Vernadsky]], [[Nikolay Zelinsky|N. D. Zelinsky]] (the inventor of the [[gas mask]] (1916)), Professors V. F. Davidov, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, A. N. Reformatsky, A. A. Eichenwald, S. G. Krapivin. The first director of MHWC was Professor [[Vladimir Guerrier|V. I. Guerrier]].

In 1905 as a director was elected S. A. Chaplygin, the leading scientist in the field of [[Hydrodynamics|hydro]]- and [[aerodynamics]], the organizer of the construction of school buildings on the Malaya Pirogovskaya street (formerly Devichie Pole). He remained in that post until 1918.

By the beginning of [[World War I]] MHWC turned into the one of the largest higher education institutions in the country. The number of trainees reached 710, and during the existence of courses released 5760 professionals. In turning into a first-class university MHWC paramount importance had an exceptional organizational skill of S. A. Chaplygin, later shown to them with equal brilliance in creating [[TsAGI]].

=== Department of Chemistry of the 2nd Moscow State University (1918–30) ===
16 October 1918 MHWC were converted into second Moscow State University. The first rector of the 2nd Moscow State University was appointed [[academician]] [[Sergey Namyotkin|S. S. Nametkin]] who worked since 1913 as a head of the Department of [[Organic Chemistry]] of MHWC. As rector, he remained until 1924. As part of the 2nd Moscow State University became the chemical-pharmaceutical department, which in 1919 was transformed into the chemical and pharmaceutical department.  At this time, on the faculty worked well-known Professors A. M. Berkengeim, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, S. S. Nametkin, M. I. Prozin, A. N. Reformatsky, [[O. N. Tsuberbiller]]. In 1929, the faculty became a chemical faculty of the university type with specialties such as:
* Chemical – pharmaceutical chemistry;
* Basic chemistry;
* [[Aniline]] chemistry;
* Chemistry of [[Rare-earth element|rare elements]];
* Coke-benzene chemistry;
* Organic Synthesis.

Faculty graduates go to work in the factories, involve in the implementation of research projects that receive a wide scope. During 1922 – 1928 years it has been published about 300 papers and 11 monographs. The greatest successes are achieved in the fields of organic and [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] under the direction of heads of departments, academics S. S. Nametkin, B. M. Rodionov, Professor A. M. Berkengeim. Production of new drugs being introduced in the pharmaceutical factory belonging to faculty.

=== Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (1930–92) ===
18 April 1930 by order of the [[People's Commissariat]] second MSU was reorganized into three independent institutions: Medical (now [[Russian National Research Medical University|RSMU them. Pirogov]]) Pedagogical (now [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|MPSU]]), and Chemical Technology (now MITHT). Last transferred to the jurisdiction of the Vsehimprom [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy|VSNKh]] [[USSR]]. In addressing this issue directly involved [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].

10 May 1931 Chemical and Pharmaceutical Faculty became an independent and received a new name – the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (MITHT). Historically, the name of the Institute is due to the nature of objects that are studied by students: they were small capacity chemical and pharmaceutical technology, technology of [[platinum group]] metals and [[rare-earth elements]]. From this moment begins a new stage of development of the institution, which is quickly becoming one of the leading universities in the [[chemical industry]]. Front of it set the goal of training for high-tech industries of chemical technology. In MITHT the first time in the country began to train engineers on the technology of thin inorganic products, synthetic rubber, thin organic produce synthetic [[liquid fuel]]s, [[organometallic compounds]] and a number of other specialties.

In the process of restructuring of education at the institute have been preserved and developed the best traditions of MHWC and 2nd Moscow State University: a high level of theoretical training and a combination of academic and scientific work, helped by the fact that the teaching work at the institute and chairing of departments were performed by outstanding scientists and educators which created a school and research areas.

Special departments were prepared engineers for industries which were still being created in the first five years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as [[atophan]], [[benzocaine]], [[procaine]], [[bromural]], [[thiokol]], [[ichtyol]], [[validol]], [[antipyrine]], [[caffeine]], [[alkaloid]]s and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic [[Alexander Nesmeyanov|A. N. Nesmeyanov]] (later President of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]]) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as [[tungsten]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]], and [[rare-earth elements]]. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of [[uranium]] and [[radium]]. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting [[Superhard material|super-hard alloys]].

7 May 1940 for academic achievement and great progress in the preparation of chemists institute is named after the outstanding Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov]].

During the war, groups of departments in collaboration with industry and research institutes conduct intensive research on defense-related development and implementation of the executed work. Thus, under the supervision of Professor N. I. Gelperin was created the most powerful bomb in [[World War II]] – FAB-5000NG that terrified [[Hitlerites]]. Efforts of the Institute as a whole and individual professors and teachers were appreciated by the country. Professors B. A. Dogadkin, N. I. Krasnopevtsev, V. V. Lebedinskij, S. S. Medvedev, S. I. Sklyarenko and Ya. K. Sirkin were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] laureates, and associate professor K. A. Bolshakov won that title twice.

The post-war period was characterized by intensive work of the Institute staff in the aftermath of the war, the creation of the necessary conditions for teaching and research. Among the most important achievements of the postwar period MITHT need to include: 
* The total synthesis of a number of natural alkaloids – [[pilocarpine]], pilozinin, alkaloids of [[propane]] series ([[tropine]], [[cocaine]]), [[arecoline]], [[eserine]], [[emetine]], [[psyhotrine]], [[emataliine]], [[cinchonamine]], [[tubocurarine]] and other alkaloids of [[curare]] ([[magnolin]], [[magnolamine]], [[dauricine]]). For this work, Professor N. A. Preobragensky in 1952 was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of the first degree;
* The synthesis of physiologically active derivatives of [[piperidine]] ([[anesthetics]], [[analgesics]], and other drugs), technology development and industrial development of high-output [[painkiller]] "[[promedol]]";
* Academician A. N. Bashkirov for the first time in the world and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1959 has been implemented industrial technology for production of higher [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohols]] on the basis of a synthesis of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] (the so-called "oxosynthesis technology");
* Development of technology for the production of vitamins [[Retinol|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Ascorbic acid|C]] and [[Vitamin K|K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]];
* Create rubbers based on new types of caoutchouc, operating at high and low temperatures in harsh operating conditions.

The high scientific – technical research conducted at the institute, evidenced by the fact that MITHT became one of the first places among the universities and research institutes on the number of implemented inventions. Employees of the institute published 450–500 scientific papers and received 50–60 [[Patent|invention certificates]] a year. The Institute conducts research on economic agreements and contracts on cooperation with industry and research institutes, whose number exceeded 150.

MITHT, in fact, has turned into a complex of the university and research institutes. On 2500–3000 students, in addition to 400 professors and lecturers, employed more than 900 scientists. Two to one – that is the ratio of students, academic and teaching staff, which was reached in MITHT. Good specialist, engineer cannot be prepared without bringing him to participate in real, serious scientific research in the learning process.

11 February 1971 for his services to the training of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Education in MITHT always featured a deep fundamental training, which included, along with a full range of natural sciences study the big cycle engineering and technological disciplines. Special training was carried out by the so-called "thin" chemical technologies that are, as a rule, small capacity technology, implemented on the basis of the latest achievements of chemical science and technology. That is, in fact, the students received a university degree in combination with engineering training.

=== Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov (1992–2011) ===
In 1992, the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov has received a new, higher educational status – status of the Academy. With the name change has changed the status and range of activities of the institute along with old technology, new specialty Humanitarian – Management Profile: "Economics and Management (chemical industry)", "[[Environmental Protection]]", "[[Standardization]] and [[Certification]]". These specialties are subject to major technologies and solve their narrow-profile tasks.

Before the transition to a tiered structure the education of students was carried out in one direction, "Chemical Technology and [[Biotechnology]]", which consists of seven specialties. After the transition academy led training in seven areas of undergraduate, graduate five areas (including 26 master's programs) and 13 majors (including 25 majors) in full-time and part-correspondence courses, and conducted post-graduate education in 24 specialties and additional education in primary educational programs MITHT.

To implement in MITHT a tiered system of higher education were opened new training units. Along with main faculties teaching of students was performed at the Faculty of [[Natural Science]], Faculty of [[Humanities]], Faculty of Management, Economics and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of further education at the Institute of [[Distance Education]].

According to the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Federal Agency for Supervision in Education and Science]] in 2008 in MITHT worked one of the most highly qualified scientific and technical teaching staff of universities and academies of Russia: doctors and candidates of sciences accounted for about 80% of the teachers. At the academy a total enrollment of 4,500 undergraduate and graduate students, taught 119 professors, doctors, and 218 associate professors, candidates of sciences.

=== Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies (2011–present) ===
[[File:Panorama of MITHT.jpg|center|1200px|thumb|Panorama of MITHT main building on Vernadsky prospect in Moscow, Russia]]
In 2011, the Academy received a University status.

The successes of the University in education, research and [[innovation]], the recognition of the scientific and pedagogical schools, its international status and worldwide fame are undoubtedly merit in the first professors, assistant professors, lecturers, and they have created in the walls of the university unique creative scientific and educational environment. Friendly and supportive atmosphere of the business and human interaction with the students and teachers together form the necessary conditions for the development of the individual, focused, motivated professional growth.

'''México Indígena''' is a project of the [[American Geographical Society]] to organize teams of geographers to research the geography of indigenous populations in Mexico. The project's stated objective is to map "changes in the cultural landscape and conservation of natural resources" that result from large scale land privatization initiatives underway in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prmapping.res.ku.edu/Mexico_Indigena/ |accessdate=5 December 2016 |title=México Indígena |publisher=University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is led by Peter Herlihy at the [[University of Kansas]] and is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense through its Foreign Military Studies Office. The project has been the subject of criticism by various groups including groups representing indigenous peoples. Critics allege that the project was not forthcoming about its U.S. military funding, and that the project has various ulterior motives besides gathering information for research purposes. The project began in 2005, and lasted through 2008.

==Project and objectives==
The México Indígena was the first in a series of planned projects to enhance United States government geographical data around the world.&lt;ref name=Herlihy/&gt; The stated objective is to produce maps of the "digital human terrain," of the region's indigenous peoples. To accomplish this, the American Geographical Society sent geographers to several regions to gather cultural and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data and build relationships with local institutions.&lt;ref name=Herlihy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023846/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |title=A Digital Geography of Indigenous Mexico: Prototype for the American Geographical Society's Bowman Expeditions |journal=Geographical Review |vauthors=Herlihy PH, Dobson JE, Robledo MA, Smith DA, Kelly JH, Viera AR |date=July 2008 |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=395–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

México Indígena was led by a team of [[geographer]]s who specialize in [[Latin American]], including [[Peter Herlihy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |title=KU Geography Department |publisher=.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916213109/http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~latamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516044624/http://www2.ku.edu/%7Elatamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Jeremy Dobson and Miguel Aguilar Robledo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609110554/http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project methods==
México Indígena's primary method for obtaining and understanding geographic data is [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] mapping (PRM). In PRM, local investigators, chosen by the communities, are trained by the formal researcher in geographic data gathering techniques. Cognitive mental (individual) maps are converted to consensual (community) maps, including only features whose nature, name, and coordinates have been verified. These are then converted to standardized maps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedlanguage.com/maps_of_the_world/map_of_mexico.shtml |title=410 « « CapitaCapita |publisher=Appliedlanguage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the communities may choose to use for educational, political, legal, or other, purposes. Participatory maps of resource-use areas, for example, have been used successfully for indigenous territorial claims in Panama (Herlihy 2003) and elsewhere.  México Indígena's primary tool for joining data from different sources to produce maps and to analyze trends is [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In many respects the México Indígena project is an example of [[military geography]]. "FMSO's goal is to help increase an understanding of the world's cultural terrain." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108191619/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges' International Development Project Database Survey notes that the México Indígena research project has received between $751,000-$1,000,000 from all sources external funds, including: U.S. Department of Defense, Foreign Military Studies Office; U.S. Department of State, Fulbright-Garcia Robles; the American Geographical Society; the University of Kansas' Center of Latin American Studies; Mexico's Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales; and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |title=Nasulgc |publisher=Nasulgc.advcomp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610063120/http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |archivedate=2012-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false attribution of location in the [[visual arts]] has been deemed "geopiracy" by Vogel (2006) and rigorously defined  in Vogel et al. (2008). México Indígena raises consequential questions when humans are ''not'' [[falsity|falsely]] situated (located) in digitally-generated topographies of the human terrain. The [[ethical]] questions generated by the moral quagmire associated with efforts such as the México Indígena project have yet to be adequately addressed. While México Indígena's ethical guidelines explicitly assert "No information will be acquired through [[deception]] or misrepresentation" &lt;ref name="web.ku.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |accessdate=October 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513151717/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; significant concerns have arisen regarding the nature of the research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciudadania-express.com/?s=Bowman&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Bowman |publisher=Ciudadania Express |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the project's embrace of a putatively [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] [[methodology]] that ostensibly "empowers" the local community in geographic knowledge generation and manipulation. Naïve statements by team leaders of Mexico Indígena's controversial [[land titling]] project designed to produce "digital human terrains," (for example, "Experience has proven that, when communities themselves give the world their understandings of their land, the world is better equipped to respect these alternative understandings"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510030525/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; underscore legitimate and deeply troubling questions that have emerged surrounding the ethical conduct of the US-based researchers involved in México Indígena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:ua2De7IgJ9oJ:https://us.indymedia.org/us/servlet/OpenMir%3Fdo%3Dgetpdf%26id%3D28825%26forIE%3D.pdf+%22Peter+Herlihy%22+AND+Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; México Indígena project leader Peter Herlihy and the editor of "Participatory Mapping of Indigenous Lands in Latin America" a special Issue of  the journal ''Human Organization'' of the [[Applied Anthropology Association]] initially explained to the Union of Organizations of the [[Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca|Sierra Juarez]] of [[Oaxaca]] (UNOSJO, S.C.) that the proposed research objective was to assess the influence that the Mexican Government's PROCEDE program has had on indigenous people's communities. Nevertheless, Herlihy did not explain that the research initiative he led was financed by [[United States]] [[Army]]'s Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO), nor did he mention that research findings would be given directly to FMSO. As the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]'s indigenous organization, the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of [[Oaxaca]] notes, "Herlihy neglected to mention this despite being expressly asked to clarify the eventual use of the data obtained through research." Similarly, he failed "to acknowledge [to UNOSJO, S.C] the participation of Radiance Technologies, a company that specializes in arms development and military intelligence" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter N.

According to a statement released at the end of January 2009 by the Project leader, Peter Herlihy, "FMSO has financed the expedition to Mexico, as well as others to Colombia, the Antilles and Jordan, through the Radiance Corporation,&lt;ref name="Radiancetech.com"/&gt; that administers the contracts between FMSO, AGS, and the universities" [http://www.dgroups.org/groups/ppgis/index.cfm?op=message&amp;msgid=935678&amp;cat_id=7144&amp;setlang=3 ("The American Geographical Society's Bowman Expeditions seek to improve geographic understanding at home and abroad: Spotlight on México Indígena")]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Managed under contract by Radiance Technologies, an Alabama-based military contractor specializing in intelligence and logistical services, Herlihy's research has been financed through FMSO, indicating for some that "the Mexico Indígena project is involved in gathering intelligence for the US Army."

One may question why Kansas City merchants may have an interest in maps of Mexico. Yet as SmartPort Inc. observes, "Located in the heart of America at the hub of the transcontinental and NAFTA trade corridors, Kansas City is a center of choice for warehousing, manufacturing and distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_corridors/corridors.htm |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129104336/http://kcsmartport.com/sec_corridors/corridors.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herlihy has commented that his research in Mexico can benefit SmartPort Inc. planners by offering them with information about the regions along Mexico's railways. He said, "They can take this information and use it for all kinds of things to really understand what they call the cultural terrain," Herlihy is reported to have also said. "You can't even predict all the uses" &lt;ref name="amergeog.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/newsrelease/Bowmanexpeditions-mex.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016175042/http://amergeog.org/newsrelease/Bowmanexpeditions-mex.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the [[American Geography Society]]'s long and intimate association with imperial agendas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/ubiquedec2006.pdf |accessdate=February 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202222128/http://www.amergeog.org/ubiquedec2006.pdf |archivedate=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is perhaps no surprise that the AGS sponsored México Indígena project has been the source of fierce criticism from indigenous organizations in Mexico, not to mention from a student-based group at the [[University of Kansas]]—the academic home of Mexico Indígena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuwatch.org/DOD.Presentation.pdf |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905122050/http://www.kuwatch.org/DOD.Presentation.pdf |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Student supporters of KU Watch's critique of México Indígena demonstrated at the University of Kansas to enhance awareness about research conducted at the University funded by the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="kansan1"&gt;[https://archive.is/20100521023606/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2008/mar/25/student_activists_seek_open_discussion_government_/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms raised by the [[University of Kansas]] student group KU Watch, Peter Herlihy, a leader of the Bowman Expedition, said that he was "proud to raise the flag and say look at what the government is funding," In addition, Herlihy reported that his research project "empowers indigenous people by putting intellectual property where it belongs." Moreover, he noted that "Geographical intelligence is needed for peace and prosperity just like it is needed for war and destruction,".&lt;ref name="kansan1"/&gt; Recently, a number of geographers have written to the AAG requesting that it conduct its own inquiry into the nature and consequences of Peter Herlihy's research in Mexico, which they "feel violated the ethical norms of our profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_5722_s09/SelectedResponsestoAGS.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Esteban Ortiz Rodea, the Mexican State representative for the Secretary for the Environment and Natural Recourses (SEMARNAT) has publicly acknowledged that no Federal funds were used to support the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in the communities of the Sierra Juárez. Moreover, Aldo González, the leader of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSOJO) apparently only became aware of "México Indígena's" ties to FMSO very recently. González has since joined other Zapotec leaders and expressed grave concern regarding the actual intentions of the [[United States Department of Defense]]-funded project.&lt;ref name="imparcialenlinea1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=71668 |accessdate=February 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122022828/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=71668 |archivedate=January 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssoaxaca.com/index.php/ciudad/10-oaxaca/6526-alertan-organizaciones-de-la-sierra-sur-sobre-presuntas-investigaciones-en-esa-region- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904180537/http://www.nssoaxaca.com/index.php/ciudad/10-oaxaca/6526-alertan-organizaciones-de-la-sierra-sur-sobre-presuntas-investigaciones-en-esa-region- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern culminated in mid January, 2009, when Juan Pérez Luna y Aldo González of the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of Oaxaca (UNOSJO) released a press statement denouncing the México Indígena's lack of full disclosure regarding funding procured from the [[United States Army]] [[Foreign Military Studies Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elenemigocomun.net/2059 |accessdate=January 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412013508/http://elenemigocomun.net/2059 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca's press release indicates, Zapotec Indigenous Peoples in Mexico are demanding full transparency from the U.S. scholar leading the [[United States Department of Defense]] funded project. In their words, "Prof. Herlihy failed to mention that he received funding from the Foreign Military Studies Office of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The failure to obtain full, free and prior [[informed consent]] is a violation of the rights of indigenous communities as codified in the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2007." (according to UN Declaration Article 11/2, research must be conducted with free prior and informed consent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Robert |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/new-war-for-hearts-and-minds |title=U.S. Military's New Afghanistan Strategy from the Front Lines |publisher=MensJournal.com |date=2010-08-15 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by the website ''El Enemigo Común'' in their essay 'A Road to Hell', "The role of the Foreign Military Studies Office in identifying 'emerging and asymmetric' threats in Oaxaca, Mexico is chilling to say the least. Fort Leavenworth has a vast array of knowledge with regards to how neo-liberal changes in Mexico's property regime will affect indigenous culture and land use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |accessdate=February 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211205/http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |archivedate=October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the "México Indígena" project are disseminated monthly at Fort Leavenworth's Foreign Military Studies Office. It is reported that during a conversation between Gen. [[Petraeus]] and the project leaders of México Indígena, Petraeus observed that, "knowledge of the cultures is a multiplier of [military] forces…the knowledge of cultural ` terrain' can be as important, and at times more, than the knowledge of the geographic terrain". Accordingly, the project heads of México Indígena are reported to have stated that "the culture and local residents are then the 'decisive terrain'".&lt;ref name="narconews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narconews.com/Issue55/article3382.html |title=Geo-Piracy in Oaxaca... and Much More |publisher=Narco News |date=2000-04-18 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called-participatory mapping (PRM) is a [[Scientific technique|technique]] that fully capitalizes on local [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[knowledge]] in the creation of "formalized" [[map]]s necessary for the creation of [[neo-liberal]] [[property]] regimes. According to an excerpt from 2006 ''Methodological Approaches'' Report of México Indígena: "The participatory mapping, or PM, methodology rests on the philosophy that local populations have some of the best and most detailed knowledge of their surrounding lands and resources and that can be collected and interpreted geographically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207021145/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |title=Geographical Review July 2008 |publisher=Amergeog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215034151/http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglecting to disclose funding sources to research participants violate the ethical principles of both the Association of American Geographers (AAG) as well as the [[Belmont Report]]. Failure to inform participants about the potential [[risk]]s or unintended consequences associated with the study abrogates the principal of informed consent, and hence violates the rights of the project participant's. México Indígena's military-funded investigations do in fact pose a risk in Oaxaca for individuals and communities, especially in light of the fractious and divisive  nature of village and inter-village politics in Southern Mexico, not to mention the socio-political turmoil in this region that has been fragmented by international migration, political factionalism and economic marginalization.

Notwithstanding such critiques, in Peter Herlihy's estimation, ''México Indígena'' is a concerted effort to renew "society's commitment to inform the public and the United States government about world geography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://communicate.aag.org/eseries/aag_org/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=19562]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Geographical Society]] has been clear about the potential sanctions accompanying a breach of ethical conduct. According to an AGS document released on the  ''México Indígena'' web site called "Developing Guidelines for Ethical Conduct of Foreign Field Research":
"''Lead scholars and other members of AGS-sponsored expeditions must comport themselves in a manner that respects cultures in the host country while simultaneously adhering to widely held values of American culture. Their actions must not adversely affect the people or natural environments of host countries. A significant breach of this provision may result in recall of individuals or entire expeditions''." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSJO) has reiterated its rejection of the [[University of Kansas]] [[geographers]] associated with the ''México Indígena'' Project for [[fail]]ing to obtain [[informed consent]] from the communities involved in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricada.blogcindario.com/2009/02/01354-ii-congreso-appo.html |title=II CONGRESO APPO. - Barricada de Oaxaca |publisher=Barricada.blogcindario.com |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/XStatic/excelsior/template/content.aspx?se=nota&amp;id=514195 |accessdate=February 21, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicadas por JA |url=http://dechivolostamales.blogspot.com/2009/02/la-geopirateria-estrategia-del.html |title=De chivo, los tamales (v2.0): La geopiratería, estrategia del Pentágono: el caso de Oaxaca |publisher=Dechivolostamales.blogspot.com |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNOSJO continues to maintain that research was conducted in a [[covert]] fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com/2009/02/congreso-de-la-appo.html |title=la_barricada_oaxaqueña: CONGRESO DE LA APPO |publisher=Barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the coordinator of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca Aldo González Rojas is reported to have said in Spanish that "the looting of traditional Zapotec knowledge about land and territoriality is tantamount to geopiracy (geopiratería), which is being conducted through the work of México Indígena in the indigenous communities of the Sierra. This in turn has generated an international debate over the ethical nature of social research conducted in indigenous communities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225073702/http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |archivedate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo González Rojas, speaking on behalf of UNOSJO, has indicated that it is necessary to determine if the information collected by "México Indígena" is for U.S. military or counter-insurgency purposes.  As such, UNOSJO has called for complete disclosure of the institutions and corporations with privileged [[access control|access]] to the data collected by México Indigena. UNOSJO holds that the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] funded [[Isaiah Bowman|Bowman]] expedition in [[Mexico]] is dedicated to developing [[military]] [[Military tactics|tactics]] for application in zones of armed conflict.  UNOSJO continues to claim that Mexico's Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) has financed the work of México Indígena through its support of the University of San Luis. SEMARNAT has previously disputed UNOSJO's claim, saying they have not funded the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in indigenous or mestizo communities in the Sierra Juárez. According to Esteban Ortiz Rodea, reports from the indigenous communities of Tiltepec, Yagavila, Ixtlán, Yagila and Guelatao suggest few indications of the actual communal collection of zapping information, despite "México Indígena" project's championing of PRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |title=Imparcial en Línea |publisher=Imparcialenlinea.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126161856/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nashville Number System''' is a method of [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] music by denoting the [[scale degree]] on which a [[Chord (music)|chord]] is built. It was developed by Neal Matthews in the late 1950s as a simplified system for [[The Jordanaires]] to use in the studio and further developed by [[Charlie McCoy]]. It resembles the [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numeral]] and [[figured bass]]  systems traditionally used to transcribe a [[chord progression]] since as early as the 1700s. 

The Nashville Number System can be used by someone with only a rudimentary background in [[music theory]]. [[Improvisation]] structures can be explained using numbers and chord changes can be communicated mid-song by holding up the corresponding number of fingers. The system is flexible, and can be embellished to include more information (such as chord color or to denote a bass note in an [[inverted chord]]). The system makes it easy for [[bandleader]]s, [[record producer]] or [[lead vocal]]ist to change the key of songs when recording in the studio or playing live, since the new key just has to be stated before the song is started. The [[rhythm section]] members can then use their knowledge of harmony to perform the song in a new key.

==Scale degrees and major chords==
The Nashville Number System, (also referred to as NNS) is similar to [[Solfège#Movable_do_solf.C3.A8ge|(movable-do) Solfège]], which uses "Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti"  to represent the seven scale degrees of the Major scale. It is also similar to [[roman numeral analysis]]; however, the NNS instead uses Arabic numerals to represent each of the scale degrees. 

In the key of C, the numbers would correspond as follows: 

C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, B=7. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nashville numerical notation !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7
|-
|-
|  So-Fa names/Solfège || Do || Re || Mi || Fa || So || La || Ti
|-
|-
| Common musical notation || C || D|| E || F || G || A || B
|}


In the key of B{{music|b}}, the numbers would be 
B{{music|b}}=1, C=2, D=3, E{{music|b}}=4, F=5, G=6, A=7. 

The key may be specified at the top of the written chord chart, or given orally by the bandleader, record producer or lead singer. The numbers do not change when transposing the composition into another key. They are simply relative to the new root note. The only knowledge required is to know the major scale for the given key. Unless otherwise notated, all numbers represent major chords, and each chord should be played for one measure.

So in the key of C, the Nashville Number System notation:

 1    4     1    5

represents a four-bar phrase, in which the band would play a C major chord (one bar), an F major chord (one bar), a C major chord (one bar), and a G major chord (one bar).

Here is an example of how two four bar phrases can be formed to create a section of a song.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! NNS !! Played in key of C !! Played in key of G
|-
| Verse)    
 1    4    5    4
 1    1    5    5
| Verse)    
 C    F    G    F
 C    C    G    G
| Verse)    
 G    C    D    C
 G    G    D    D
|}

Accidentals modifying a scale degree are usually written to the left of the number. {{music|b}}7 ("flat 7") represents a B{{music|b}} major chord in the key of C, or an A{{music|b}} major chord in the key of B{{music|b}}, or an F major chord in the key of G.

== {{anchor|Chord_types}}Chord type==
A number by itself represents the enharmonic [[triad (music)]] on the scale degree:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nashville numerical notation !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7
|-
|-
|  Chord type (major key)|| major || minor || minor || major || major || minor || diminished
|-
|-
|  Chord type (minor key} || minor || diminished || major || minor|| minor || major || major
|-
|-

| Chord type (harmonic minor key)  || minor || diminished|| augmented || minor || major || major || diminished
|}

If the song includes other chords besides these triads, additional notation is needed. 

If a chord root is not in the scale, the symbols {{music|b}} or {{music|#}} can be added. In the key of C major, an E{{music|b}} triad would be notated as 3{{music|b}}. 

Minor chords (outside the key) are noted with a dash after the number or a lower case m, In the key of D, 1 is D major, 1- or 1m would be D minor. Similarly a major chord can be noted with a capital M. In the key of C, 2 is D minor, 2M is D major.

Other chord qualities such as major sevenths, suspended chords, and dominant sevenths use familiar symbols: 4&lt;sup&gt;{{music|major}}7&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;sus&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; 1 would stand for
F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|major}}7&lt;/sup&gt; G&lt;sup&gt;sus&lt;/sup&gt; G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; C in the key of C, or
E{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;{{music|major}}7&lt;/sup&gt; F&lt;sup&gt;sus&lt;/sup&gt; F&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; B{{music|b}} in the key of B{{music|b}}. A superscript &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means "add 2" or "add 9".

[[Inverted chord|Chord inversions]] and chords with other altered bass notes are notated analogously to regular [[slash chord]] notation. In the key of C, C/E (C major [[first inversion]], with E bass) is written as 1/3; G/B is written as 5/7; A/G (an inversion of A7) is written as 6M/5; F/G (F major with G bass) is 4/5. Just as with simple chords, the numbers refer to scale degrees; specifically, the scale degree number used for the bass note is that of the note's position in the tonic's scale (as opposed to, for example, that of its position in the scale of the chord being played).  In the key of B{{music|b}}, 1/3 stands for B{{music|b}}/D, 5/7 stands for F/A, 6/5 stands for Gm/F, and 4/5 stands for E{{music|B}}/F.

Depending on the style, you can use chord inversions to achieve an alternative sound when using the Nashville number system. Some examples that could be applied to practice is the 1-4-5 chord progression. Lets say we use the C minor chord and couple it with an inverted F Minor chord to a G diminished. The sound attributes changes subtly. This can be effective when you're attempting to capture a specific emotion or sound. 

==Rhythm and articulation==
NNS charts use unique rhythmic symbols as well, and variations in practice exist.  A diamond shape around a number indicates that the chord should be held out or allowed to ring as a whole note. Conversely, the marcato symbol ^ over the number, or a [[staccato]] dot underneath, indicates that the chord should be immediately choked or stopped. The "push" symbol ("&amp;lt;" and "&amp;gt;" are both used) syncopates the indicated chord, moving its attack back one eighth note, to the preceding "and". A sequence of several chords in a single measure is notated by underlining the desired chord numbers. (Some charts use parentheses or a box for this.) If you underline two numbers it is assumed that the chord values are even. In 4/4 time that would mean the first chord would be played for two beats and the second chord would be played for two beats. &lt;u&gt;2-&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 means a minor 2 chord for two beats, then a 5 chord for two beats, then a 1 chord for four beats. If the measure is not evenly divided, beats can be indicated by dots or hash marks over the chord numbers. Three dots over a given chord would tell you to play that chord for  three beats. Alternatively, [[Chord_chart#Rhythmic_notation|rhythmic notation]] can be used.

The '''Obelisk of Axum''' ({{lang-am|የአክሱም ሐውልት}}) is a 4th-century AD, 24-metre-tall (79-feet) [[granite]] [[stele]]/[[obelisk]], weighing 160&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s, in the city of [[Axum]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It is ornamented with two false [[door]]s at the base and features decorations resembling [[window]]s on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top part, which used to be enclosed by metal frames.

==History==

===Overview===
The obelisk—properly termed a "[[stele]]" or, in the local [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], ''hawelt/hawelti'' (as it is not topped by a pyramid)&amp;nbsp;— is found along with many other stelae in the city of [[Axum]] in modern-day [[Ethiopia]]. The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century A.D. by subjects of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in Axum was a very old practice (today it is still possible to see primitive roughly carved stelae near more elaborated "obelisks"), probably borrowed from the Kushitic kingdom of [[Meroe]]. Their function is supposed to be that of "markers" for underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various "stelae fields". The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called [[King Ezana's Stele]], in the 4th century A.D.
[[File:2 giugno 2002-Axum.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Obelisk of Axum in [[Rome]] in 2002, before its repatriation.]]

King [[Ezana]] (c.321&amp;nbsp;– c. 360), influenced by his childhood tutor [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]], introduced [[Christianity]] to Axum, precluding the [[Paganism|pagan]] practice of erecting burial stelae (it seems that at the feet of each obelisk, together with the grave, there was also a sacrificial altar).

Over the course of time, many of these stelae fell to the ground&lt;ref&gt;Poissonnier B. (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/3439296/_2014 The giant stelae of Aksum in the light of the 1999 excavations], in Fauvelle-Aymar F.-X.(ed.), ''Palethnology of Africa, P@lethnology'', '''4''', 49-86.&lt;/ref&gt; due to: structural collapse (as, probably, in the case of the Great Stele, measuring 33 m), possibly immediately after their erection; earthquakes (Axum is in a [[seismic zone]]); or the military incursions of the Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi|Ahmad Gragn]] during the [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] from 1529 to 1543. In the 19th century, of the three major "royal" stelae, only [[King Ezana's Stele]] remained erect, shown in the painting "Sight of Axum" of [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] (1780–1827).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

At the end of 1935, following the Italian occupation, Italian soldiers found the Obelisk of Axum was collapsed and broken. It had fallen in the 4th century and had broken into five pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/laws/pdf/abstract_scovazzi.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= UNESCO |first= Tullio |last= Scovazzi |date= April 2008 |title= The return of the Axum Obelisk |quote= Abstract with pictorial }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, it was taken as war booty and moved to Italy by the Fascist regime, which wanted to commemorate the occupation of Ethiopia and the birth of the ephemeral "new Roman Empire" (see [[Italian Empire]]). The stele was transported by truck along the tortuous route between Axum and the port of [[Massawa]], taking five trips over a period of two months. It arrived via ship in [[Naples]] (on a ship called ''[[Battle of Adowa|Adwa]]''), on March 27, 1937. It was then transported to Rome, where it was reassembled and erected on [[Porta Capena]] square in front of the Ministry for Italian Africa (later the headquarters of the [[United Nations]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]) and the [[Circus Maximus]]. It was officially unveiled on October 28, 1937 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the [[March on Rome]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The operation was coordinated by Ugo Monneret de Villard.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} 

A bronze statue of the [[Lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, was taken along with the obelisk and displayed in front of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini railway station]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Repatriation===
[[File:Aksum-107547.jpg|alt=Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation|thumb|Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation]]
In a 1947 UN agreement, Italy agreed to return the stele to Ethiopia,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1402354.stm |title=No return for Ethiopian treasure |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-22 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the other looted piece, the Lion of Judah. While the latter was returned in 1967 following the 1961 visit of emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to Italy, little action was taken to return the stele for more than 50 years, partly as a consequence of the considerable technical difficulties related to its transportation.

One source&lt;ref&gt;For example, prince Amedeo di Savoia&lt;/ref&gt; also suggests that emperor Haile Sellassie, after hearing of these technical difficulties (and of the enormous costs necessary to overcome them), decided to grant the stele to the city of Rome, as a gift for the "renewed friendship" between Italy and Ethiopia. This assertion, however, remains very controversial and was not recognized by successive authorities. Colonel [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] who overthrew the emperor in 1974, asked the Italian government to return the stele to Ethiopia. Another controversial arrangement, according to some sources, seems to be that Italy could keep the stele in exchange for the construction of a hospital in Addis Ababa (Saint Paul's Hospital) and for the cancellation of debts owed by Ethiopia. In any case, after the fall of the Mengistu regime, the new Ethiopian government asked for the return of the stele, finding a positive answer from the then president of the Italian republic [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], in April 1997.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

[[File:Axum northern stelea park.jpg|thumb|The Northern Stelae Park in [[Axum]], with the [[King Ezana's Stele]] at the centre and the Great Stele lying broken.]]
The first steps in dismantling the structure were taken in November 2003, under the supervision of Giorgio Croci, Professor of Structural Problems of Monuments and Historical Buildings at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref name="spectator-2003"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Johnson | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) | title=Trundling Musso’s stolen obelisk back to its African home | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/03/trundling-mussos-stolen-obelisk-back-to-its-african-home/ | newspaper=The Spectator | date=12 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ship the stele back to Ethiopia in March 2004, but the repatriation project encountered a series of obstacles: The runway at [[Axum Airport]] was considered too short for a cargo plane carrying even one of the thirds into which the stele had been cut; the roads and bridges between Addis Ababa and Axum were thought to be not up to the task of road transport; and access through the nearby [[Eritrea]]n port of Massawa&amp;nbsp;— which was how the stele originally left Africa&amp;nbsp;— was impossible due to the [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia#Eritrea|strained state of relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another reason for the delay in returning the stele from Italy to Ethiopia in 2004 was because of Italy's claim of not having the money to pay for the transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/obelisk_email.htm |title=E |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to get help from the United States was unsuccessful, as Americans stated that their planes were tied up in the war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/hertage/ambassador.htm |title=An Open Letter to the US Ambassador in Addis |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous attempts by Professor [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], who spearheaded the campaign to return the stele, remained unsuccessful until an American-Ethiopian, Dr. Aberra Molla, threatened the Italian government with the option of raising the money on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|title = Axsum Obelisk|publisher = Aberra Molla|date = 2004-03-07|accessdate = 2013-07-07|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725213113/http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|archivedate = 2015-07-25|dead-url = yes|type = Email}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aksum-107569.jpg|alt=Inauguration Ceremony for the reinstallation of the Aksum Obelisk|thumb|Inauguration Ceremony for the reinstallation of the Aksum Obelisk]]
The runway at Axum airport was then upgraded specially to facilitate the return of the stele.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4458105.stm |title=Obelisk arrives back in Ethiopia |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismantled stele remained sitting in a warehouse near Rome's [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport]], until 19 April 2005 when the middle piece was repatriated by use of an [[Antonov An-124]], amidst much local celebration.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; It was the largest and heaviest piece of air freight ever carried.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; The second piece was returned on 22 April 2005, with the final piece returned on 25 April 2005. The operation cost Italy $7.7 million.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; The stele remained in storage while Ethiopia decided how to reconstruct it without disturbing other ancient treasures still in the area (especially King Ezana's Stele). By March 2007 the foundation had been poured for the re-erection of the stele near King Ezana's Stele, structurally consolidated in this occasion. Reassembly began in June 2008, with a team chosen by [[UNESCO]] and led by Giorgio Croci, and the monument was re-erected in its original home and unveiled on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7597589.stm |title=Ethiopia unveils ancient obelisk |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was reassembled in Rome in 1937 three [[steel]] bars were inserted per section. When the obelisk was hit by [[lightning]] during a violent [[thunderstorm]] over Rome on 27 May 2002 this caused "considerable" damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2012770.stm |title=Rome obelisk struck by lightning |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-05-28 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new reconstruction the three sections are fixed together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_maggio_26/l_obelisco_conteso_rinasce_ad_axum_6f8d4c02-2aec-11dd-9793-00144f02aabc.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Corriere della sera (in Italian)'&amp;#39;;L’obelisco conteso rinasce ad Axum |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a total of eight [[aramid]] fiber ([[Kevlar]]) bars: four between the first and second and four between the second and third sections. This arrangement guarantees structural resistance during earthquakes and avoids the use of steel, so as not to again make the stele a magnet for lightning and to avoid [[rust]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Several other similar stelae/obelisks exist in Ethiopia and Eritrea, such as the [[Hawulti (monument)|Hawulti]] in [[Metera]]. Like the Obelisk of Axum, the other stelae have a [[rectangular]] base with a false door carved on one side.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Physical Cultural Studies''' (PCS) encompasses the diversely focused field of scholarly work which is united by a commitment toward engaging varied dimensions or expressions of (in)active bodies or physical culture (Andrews &amp; Silk, 2011). In this physical culture is understood as “cultural practices in which the physical body – the way it moves, is represented, has meanings assigned to it, and is imbued with power – is central” (Vertinsky, quoted in Silk &amp; Andrews, 2011)
Physical Cultural Studies is closely related to the fields of [[sociology of sport|sport sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[sociology of the body]], [[body culture studies]], [[queer studies]] and [[disability studies]]. 

==Description==

===Empirical focus===
PCS is predominantly concerned with studying the active body. The aim of such a focus is to problematise the taken-for-granted aspects of human movement and embodiment in such a way that makes social divisions (class, gender, ethnicity, ability, generation, sex, nation, race), and the processes that produce, reproduce and contest these divisions become visible and changeable. In this respect, we can see that the 'physical' is of central importance to PCS. Indeed, it is this empirical focus ( and subsequent breadth) that separates PCS from fields such as the sociology of sport. This is because PCS scholars take as their subjects of study - all the many and varied, more or less 'legitimate', popular and emerging, work or leisure related - forms of physical culture. areas of study include: exercise, health, dance, recreation, leisure, fitness, daily living, and work related activities.

===Concern with Context===
In the analysis of these activities PCS considers context and contextualisation to be vital. Indeed, how can one understand a cultural practice without reference to all the surrounding factors, flows, processes, actors and institutions with which it is articulated? For example, PCS researchers identify and seek to understand the complex political, economic, social and technological relationships in which the event occurs in order to understand physical culture as relational.

===Social Change===
Those in the field of physical cultural studies believe that research into, or understanding of, physical culture is of little importance if it does not make a difference in the world. Therefore, the idea of 'value free' research is not accepted in PCS. Instead, [[Partisanship]] is the dominant ideal. Such a perspective is related to many aspects of PCS study that vary from 'mainstream' academia. For example, PCS is concerned with care and community in which public education is of central importance. In addition, PCS aims to be political, empowering and reflexive. Finally PCS researchers attempt to question their presupposed hierarchy over the researched.

See also [[praxis (process)|praxis]]

===Methodology===
PCS incorporates many methods of gathering data, oftentimes implementing a variety of methods together to create rich, contextual and multi-perspective analyses of physical culture. Such methods include ethnography, auto ethnography, contextual analysis, media analysis, discourse analysis and participant observation.

'''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections.

== History ==
People have long been interested in predicting election outcomes. Quotes of betting odds on [[Pope|papal succession]] appear as early as 1503, when such wagering was already considered “an old practice.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner. ''Behind Locked Doors: A History of Papal Elections''. New York, Palgrave, 2003 (pages 88 and 250).&lt;/ref&gt; Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As one prominent example, Charles James Fox, the late-eighteenth-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler. His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan, noted that“(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards, Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time.”&lt;ref&gt;George Otto Trevelyan. ''The Early History of Charles James Fox''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880 (page 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of scientific polling in 1936, betting odds in the [[United States]] correlated strongly to vote results.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. ''Markets vs. polls as election predictors: An historical assessment''. Electoral Studies 31 (2012) 532–539. Elsevier, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1936, [[opinion poll]]s have been a basic part of political forecasting. More recently, [[prediction market]]s have been formed, starting in 1988 with [[Iowa Electronic Markets]].

With the advent of statistical techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is no surprise, then, that election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.&lt;ref name ="ef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml|title= Election forecasting|last1= Stegmaier|first1= Mary|last2= Norpoth|first2= Helmut|date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2016-09-26|doi =10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have constructed models of voting behavior to forecast the outcomes of elections. These forecasts are derived from theories and empirical evidence about what matters to voters when they make electoral choices. The forecast models typically rely on a few predictors in highly aggregated form, with an emphasis on phenomena that change in the short-run, such as the state of the economy, so as to offer maximum leverage for predicting the result of a specific election.&lt;ref name = "ef"/&gt;

An early successful model which is still being used is [[The Keys to the White House]] by [[Allan Lichtman]]. Election forecasting in the United States was first brought to the attention of the wider public by [[Nate Silver]] and his [[FiveThirtyEight]] website in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. Currently, there are many competing models trying to predict the outcome of elections in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.

== Methods ==
===Averaging polls===

Combining poll data lowers the forecasting mistakes of a poll.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123102051/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political forecasting models include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average.

===Poll damping===

Poll damping is when incorrect indicators of public opinion are not used in a forecast model. For instance, early in the campaign, polls are poor measures of the future choices of voters. The poll results closer to an election are a more accurate prediction.  Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|title=Polls and Votes|journal=American Politics Quarterly|date=October 1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=408–433|doi=10.1177/1532673X9602400402|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/408.abstract|accessdate=11 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the power of poll damping in political forecasting.

===Nomenclature===

When discussing the likelihood of a particular electoral outcome, political forecasters tend to use one of a small range of shorthand phrases.&lt;ref name="rollcall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.cq.com/electionguide/|title=Election Guide 2018|publisher=Roll Call Politics|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings|title=2018 Senate Race Ratings|date=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Cook Political Report]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/17/here-are-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-according-to-election-rating-systems/|title=Here are the House seats most likely to flip, according to election rating systems|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=17 August 2018|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*'''Solid''' (e.g., "Solid Republican"), also '''Safe'''.  Very unlikely that the party which currently holds the seat will change in the upcoming election.
*'''Likely''' (e.g., "Likely Democrat"), also '''Favored'''.  It is not thought at the moment that the seat will be particularly competitive, and hence the party is likely to remain unchanged, but there is a possibility this may alter. 
*'''Lean''' (e.g., "Leans Independent"). One candidate / party has a slight advantage in polling and forecasting, but other outcomes are possible.
*'''Tilt'''.  Used less widely than the other terms, but indicates a very small advantage to one or another party.&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;
*'''Toss-Up'''. These are the seats that are considered to be the most competitive, with more than one party having a good chance of winning.

== Markets ==
[[Prediction market]]s show very accurate forecasts of an election outcome. One example is the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]]. In a study, 964 election polls were compared with the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004. [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the Iowa Electronic Markets topped the polls 74% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, damped polls have been shown to top prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725101900/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperform all markets or models.

== Regression models ==
Political scientists and economists oftentimes use [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections. This is done to help forecast the votes of the political parties – for example, Democrats and Republicans in the US. The information helps their party’s next presidential candidate forecast the future. Most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll, or a presidential approval rating.
Bayesian statistics can also be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the true proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate in each state, given both the polling data available and the previous election results for each state.  Each poll can be weighted based on its age and its size, providing a highly dynamic forecasting mechanism as Election day approaches.   http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu/ is an example of a site that employs such methods.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Rigdon, S., Jacobson, S.H., Cho, W.T., Sewell, E.C., Rigdon, C.J., 2009, “A Bayesian Prediction Model for the United States Presidential Election,” American Politics Research, 37(4), 700-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prayers for Bobby''''' is a televised [[docudrama]] that premiered on the [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]] network on January 24, 2009. It is based on the critically acclaimed book, ''[[Prayers for Bobby: A Mother's Coming to Terms with the Suicide of Her Gay Son]]'', by [[Leroy F. Aarons]], which is itself based on the true story of the life and legacy of Bobby Griffith, a young [[homosexuality|gay]] man who killed himself in 1983 due to his mother's [[homophobia]]. [[Ryan Kelley]] stars as Bobby Griffith and [[Sigourney Weaver]] portrays Mary, his mother.

The film was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] ("Best Movie" &amp; "Best Actress"), and Sigourney Weaver was nominated for the 2010 Golden Globe Award, and the 2010 Screen Actors Guild Award. It also won the 2010 [[GLAAD Media Award]], and producers were nominated for the 2010 [[Producers Guild of America Award]]. The film won the 2010 Entertainment Industry Coalition PRISM Award ("Best Movie for Television"). In 2015, executive producers Daniel Sladek &amp; Chris Taaffe were invited by the Vice President of the EU to the European Parliament in Brussels where they presented ''Prayers for Bobby'' to Members of Parliament on International Homophobia Day.

==Plot==
Mary Griffith is a devout Christian who raises her children—Ed, Bobby, Joy and Nancy—according to the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] teachings of her local [[Presbyterian]] church in the late 1970s and early 1980s in [[Walnut Creek, California]]. 

Ed finds Bobby resisting temptations to overdose on [[Aspirin]] as an initial suicide attempt before Bobby confides to him that he is [[Homosexuality|gay]]. Life changes for the entire family after Mary learns about his secret. In hopes of converting him, she takes him to a [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], who explains to Bobby's parents that a person's homosexuality is the result of lacking a close relationship with parental figures. She then advises Bobby to pray harder and seek solace in Church activities, as well as to arrange a special bonding time with his father. While spending such quality time with his father, Bobby explains his desire to become a writer, to which his father suggests "some dreams are just not realistic." 

Bobby's father and siblings slowly come to terms with his homosexuality, but Mary believes God can cure him. To get away from his family, Bobby visits his cousin Jeanette in [[Portland, Oregon]]; she has always been accepting of his sexual orientation and tries to help him realize that his mother will never change. Desperate for his mother's approval, he does what is asked of him, but through it all, the Church's disapproval of homosexuality and his mother's attempts to suppress his growing behaviors in public cause him to grow increasingly withdrawn and depressed.

Stricken with guilt, Bobby finds a boyfriend, David, at a [[gay bar]]. Nonetheless, before leaving the house with David, Mary informs Bobby that she "will not have a gay son." After Bobby finds David betraying him for another boy, he continues to think of his mother's words of [[prejudice]], i.e., when saying "homosexuality is a sin and (gays) are doomed to spend eternity in hell," as well as calling him "sick," "perverted," and "a danger to our children." Following his subsequent depression and self-loathing which intensifies, one night he free falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler truck, which kills him instantly. The family receives the news the following day and are devastated.

Faced with their tragedy, Mary begins to question herself and her Church's interpretation of the [[Scripture]]. Through her long and emotional journey, Mary slowly reaches out to the [[gay community]] and discovers unexpected support from them. She becomes acquainted with a local reverend of the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], who convinces her to attend a meeting of [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG). It is there she recalls Bobby being different from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and reassures herself that his true value was in his heart.

Mary then gives a speech in a Walnut Creek city council meeting supporting a local "gay day" live on television. She tells of her experiences with Bobby, the struggles she initially had coping with him [[coming out of the closet]] and her stubbornness to reevaluate her religious beliefs which were nothing more than "bigotry" and "dehumanizing slander." Mary also acknowledges how she came to realize that Bobby's sexual orientation was quite natural in God's image and his suicide was subsequently due to poor parenting. She concludes her speech by urging people to think before they say, voice, or support [[homophobia]] because "a child is listening." The measure is rejected, but Mary and her family travel to San Francisco with fellow PFLAG members and walk in a [[gay pride parade]], during which she sees another young man just like Bobby observing the parade. She walks over and hugs him, finally coming to terms with her son's death and vowing to work hard for the rights of gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Lifetime Television"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/prayers-bobby |title=Prayers For Bobby |work=[[MyLifetime.com]] |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231042811/http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/prayers-bobby |archivedate=December 31, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Queer Crips: Disabled Gay Men and Their Stories''''' is a 2004 anthology edited by Bob Guter and John R. Killacky. The book is a  collection of personal stories from gay men with disabilities. The stories are told through a variety of literary genres, including poetry, prose, and interviews. The book won the [[2004 Lambda Literary Awards|2004 Lambda Literary Award]] for the Anthologies/Non-fiction category. Contributors to the book include gay men such as [[Greg Walloch]], [[Kenny Fries]], [[J. Quinn Brisben]], and [[Eli Clare]]. After being turned down for publication by 30 publishers, the anthology was finally published by Harrington Park Press, an imprint of [[Haworth Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gay-disabled-and-with-a-lot-to-talk-about-2788997.php |title=Gay, disabled and with a lot to talk about |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01 |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=2004-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the publication of the [[Society for Disability Studies]], wrote a review of ''Queer Crips'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Queer Crips can definitely boast of well-crafted, gorgeous poetry, there are a few exceptions. Perhaps it is only a matter of taste, but some of the poetry is of the cathartic type without the "craft" elements of formal published poetry or the spectacle of a performance piece. However, what is great about including such poetry is that it elevates all expressions of feeling and, in a sense, truly captures the sharing of the soul that poetry is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/518/695 |title=BOOK &amp; FILM REVIEWS |publisher=''[[Society for Disability Studies|Disability Studies Quarterly]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability'', [[Robert McRuer]] notes that the stories in ''Queer Crips'' are "nonheteronormative in their broadest sense" and that it is "striking how much the convergence of disability and homosexuality in "Queer Crips" appears to authorize erotic inventiveness and play". McRuer further writes that the anthology implicitly draws a parallel between [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and "compulsory able-bodiedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last= McRuer|first= Robert|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[New York University Press]]|location= [[New York City]]|isbn= 0-814-75712-X|page= |pages= 243–4|accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdNb_XJrPwwC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the “logical expression” of feelings, a “symbolic form”.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|last=Langer|first=S.K.|title=Philosophy in a New Key: A Study of the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art|year=1942|publisher=Pelican book|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are an example of [[syntagm]], which interacting [[sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] form a meaningful whole.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=USA and Canada|isbn=978-0-415-36375-4|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are also considered [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]] genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning.&lt;ref name=Lemke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemke|first=J|title=Multimodal Genres and Transmedia Traversals: Social Semiotics and the Political Economy of the Sign|journal=Semiotica|year=2009|volume=173|issue=1-4|pages=283–297|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2009.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of music correlated with visuals can be described in terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal [[synchronicity]] and cross-modal [[Homology (sociology)|homology]].&lt;ref name=Eisenstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenstein|first=Sergi|title=The Film Sense|year=1943|publisher=Farber|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified syntagm.&lt;ref name="Lemke"/&gt; Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the [[semantic]] content of the lyrics.&lt;ref name=Bjornberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjornberg|first=Alf|title=Structural Relationships in Music Video|journal=Popular Music|year=1994|volume=13|pages=51–74|doi=10.1017/S026114300000684X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics in music videos is different from a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] analysis because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in.&lt;ref name=Chattah&gt;{{cite web|last=Chattah|first=J.R.|title=Semitoics, Pragmatics and Metaphor in Film Music Analysis|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04042006-140957/unrestricted/JuanChattah_Dissertation.pdf|work=(Doctoral Dissertation)|publisher=Electronic Theses, Florida State University|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are early critics of the importance of analyzing music videos as a semiotic system. [[Frederic Jameson]]'s definition of music videos is a schizophrenic string of isolated, discontinued signifiers, failing to link up into a coherent sequence, as a string without a center.&lt;ref name=Peeters&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peeters|first=H|title=The Semiotics of Music Videos: It Must be Written in the Stars|journal=Image and Narrative|year=2004|volume=8|issue=1760-678X|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/issue08/heidipeeters.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible editing==
Many semiotic analysts have examined music videos to decode messages that are being sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. [[Daniel Chandler]]'s example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, "a man awakens suddenly in the middle of the night, bolts up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze"&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;(Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in [[narrative]] style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters&lt;ref name=Vernallis /&gt; [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video, ''Thriller'' is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical [[archetype]].&lt;ref name="Bjornberg"/&gt; Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain [[abstract art|abstract]] images. ''Sledgehammer'', by [[Peter Gabriel]] is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential [[connotative]] meaning of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions.&lt;ref name=Vernallis&gt;{{cite book|last=Vernallis|first=Carol|title=Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertextuality==
[[Intertextuality]], for media purposes, references other popular culture objects within their video, and then the audience creates their meaning of the video according to the intentional suggestion created with relationships between primary and secondary texts.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=James|title=Film and Television after DVD|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=NY|isbn=0-203-89429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, intertextuality is considered links within a context or medium that bind text to other text (Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt; ). Many editors and directors use intertextuality in music videos because it combines different cultural [[codes]] taken from previous texts that are sensible for many audiences. Using intertextuality in music videos allow a viewer to identify with their [[theoretical]] framework of knowledge, and use it to define their identity. This approach can be used to gain popularity for referenced ideas, and influence consumers with a persuasive agenda. ''[[Material Girl]]'', by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is an example of using intertextuality because she is acting like [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend]].'' This is a direct cinematic reference which allows an active audience to draw conclusions to the meaning of the message.

==Intratextuality==
[[Intratextuality]] is a term that is derived from intertextuality, but is considered combining secondary references for marketing and promotional purposes. This type of technique is also called anchorage, found by [[Roland Barthes]]:&lt;ref name=Barthes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=Image, Music, Text|year=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0-374-52136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; anchoring text to a context that changes the intentional meaning. An example of this would be, the music video, ''Right Now'', by [[Van Halen]]. The lyrics of the song ''Right Now'' suggest an entirely different meaning than the social empowering messages shown through the music video.

==Bricolage==
[[Bricolage]] is also an example of using many different texts within a context for promotional, marketing, or popularity value.&lt;ref name=Corona&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corona|first=V|title=Memory Monsters and Lady Gaga|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=2011|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Gaga]] uses cultural bricolage in her music videos by using fashion and previous memorable characteristics of former pop stars. Michael Jackson's ''Leave Me Alone'' is also a form of bricolage because it is a collage of already popular people and pop culture [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s combined to portray his own message.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23750">Various '''sociological classifications of religious movements''' have been proposed by scholars. In the [[sociology of religion]], the most widely used classification  is the church-sect [[wikt:typology|typology]]. The typology states that churches, ecclesia, denominations and sects form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are break-away groups from more mainstream religions and tend to be in tension with society.

Cults and [[new religious movement]]s fall outside this continuum and in contrast to aforementioned groups often have a novel teaching. They have been classified on their attitude towards society and the level of involvement of their adherents.

== Church-sect typology ==
[[File:Church-sect continuum.svg|right|thumb|400px|A diagram of the church-sect typology continuum. Include church, denomination, sect, cult, new religious movement, and institutionalized sect.]]
This church-sect typology has its origins in the work of [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Dawson2006p26"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of ''[[sects]]'' to the equilibrium maintaining ''churches''. Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.

Many labels are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably. Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.

These differing religions are often classified by sociologists as ''[[ideal type]]s''. Ideal types are ''pure'' examples of the categories. Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually holds as their ''ideal type'' categorisation will vary. Nevertheless, the categorisation scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.

===Church and ecclesia===
Johnstone provides the following seven characteristics of churches:&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Upper Sadle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate "citizenship" with "membership"
* Exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition
* Are very closely allied with the state and secular powers; frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement
* Are extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor
* Employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination
* Primarily gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks
* Allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions

The classical example of a ''church'' by this definition is the [[Catholic Church]], especially in the past, such as the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]. Today, the Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of [[religious pluralism]], or competition among religions. This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States. The change from a ''church'' to a ''denomination'' is still under way in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.

[[Islam]] is a church in countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iran, where there is no [[separation of church and state]]. The [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] states: "[The Constitution of Saudi Arabia is] [[Qur'an|God's Book]] [the Qur'an] and the [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad|His Prophet]] [Muhammad]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://saudinf.com/main/c541.htm The Basic Law - Saudi Arabia Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These nations are ruled under an official interpretation of [[religious law]] (''[[Salafi]]'' in the case of Saudi Arabia), and the religious law predominates the legal system. Saudi Arabia, however, lacks Johnstone's criteria for an ordained clergy and a strictly hierarchical structure, although it has the ''[[ulema]]''. In the [[Shi'a]] denominations, there is a professional clergy led by a [[Grand Ayatollah]].

A slight modification of the ''church'' type is that of ''ecclesia''.&lt;ref&gt;von Wiese 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body. The [[state church]]es of some European nations would fit this type.

===Denominations===
{{main|Religious denomination}}
The ''denomination'' lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. A denomination is one religion among many. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:
# similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times
# maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of [[religious pluralism]]
# rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some actively pursue evangelization
# accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute
# follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression
# train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification
# accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches
# often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society

Most of the major Christian bodies formed post-reformation are denominations by this definition (e.g., [[Baptists]], [[Methodist]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
{{main|Sect}}
Sociologically, a "sect" is defined as a newly formed religious group that formed to protest elements of its parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of [[apostasy]] or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they often decry liberal trends in denominational development and advocate a return to so-called "true" religion.

Leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not yet entirely understood. Most scholars believe that when sect formation involves social class distinctions, they reflect an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).

After their formation, sects can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination. If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve. If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior. The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects. The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an ''institutionalized sect'' can result. Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development. They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. Examples include: [[Hutterites]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], and the [[Amish]].

Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]]). Examples include: [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

An example of an institutionalized sect that did not become a denomination are the [[Mennonites]]. 

==Cult typology==
{{main|Cult}}
The concept of "cult" has lagged behind in the refinement of the terms that are used in analyzing the other forms of religious origination. Bruce Campbell discusses Troeltsch's concept in defining cults as non-traditional religious groups that are based on belief in a divine element within the individual. He gives three ideal types of cults:

# a mystically-oriented illumination type
# an instrumental type, in which inner experience is sought solely for its effects
# a service-oriented type that is focused on aiding others.

He also gives six groups in the applications of analysis:  Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, Spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation.

In the late nineteenth century, there have been a number of works that help in clarifying what is involved in cults.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara&lt;/ref&gt; There are several scholars of this subject, such as Joseph Campbell and Bruce Campbell, who have noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual. It is either Soul, Self, or True Self.  Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and mysticism.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention. One is mystical and the other is instrumental.  This can divide the cults into being either occults or metaphysical assemblies.

On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual.  Other than the two main  types, there is also a third type.  This is service-oriented. Campbell states that "the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders." &lt;ref&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cults or new religious movements{{Anchor|Cults or New Religious Movements}} ===
By sociological typology, ''cults'' are, like sects, new religious groups. But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group, though this is by no means always the case. The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to ''pure'' religion but rather the embracing of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scriptures or new prophecy). Cults are also much more likely to be led by [[charismatic authority|charismatic leaders]] than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies synthesized from many sources. Cults tend to emphasize the individual and individual peace.

Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations. As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations. Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics. But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the ''cult'' type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations.  Some denominations in the US that began as cults include [[Christian Science]] and the [[Nation of Islam]].

Finally, there is a push in the social [[scientific study of religion]] to begin referring to ''cults'' as ''New Religious Movements'' (NRMs). This is the result of the often pejorative and derogatory meanings attached to the word "''cult''" in popular language.

=== Criticism ===
Religious scholar [[John A. Saliba]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[John Saliba|Saliba, John]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ''Understanding new religious movements'' second edition 2003 {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} Altamira Press, book flap
&lt;/ref&gt; notes the many attempts to draw a classification or typology of cults and/or [[sect]]s, but concludes that the divergences that exist in these groups' practices, doctrines, and goals do not lend themselves to a simple classification that has universal approval. He argues that the influx of Eastern religious systems, including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Shintoism]], which do not fit within the traditional distinctions between church, sect, denomination and cult, have compounded typological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;

==Wallis' distinction between cults and sects==
The sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] (1945–1990) introduced differing definitions of [[sect]]s and [[cult]]s. He argued that a cult is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member." According to Wallis, cults are generally described as "oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant, non-exclusive", making "few demands on members", without possessing a "clear distinction between members and non-members", having "a rapid turnover of membership", and are transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the "cultic milieu." Wallis contrasts a cult with a [[sect]] in that he asserts that sects are characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation, such as [[Collective Salvation|collective salvation]], and their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swatos, Jr. Editor |publisher=Altamira press}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish three types of [[cult]]s, classified on the basis of the levels of organizational and [[customer|client]] (or adherent) involvement:&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saliba pages 140-141"&gt;[[John Saliba|Saliba, John]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ''Understanding new religious movements'' second edition 2003 {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} Altamira press, pages 140-141
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Audience cults'' which have hardly any organization because participants/consumers lack significant involvement.
* ''Client cults'', in which the service-providers exhibit a degree of organization in contrast to their clients. Client cults link into moderate-commitment social networks through which people exchange [[goods and services]]. The relationship between clients and the [[leadership|leader]]s of client cults resembles that of patients and therapists.
* ''Cult movements'', which seek to provide services that meet all of their adherents' spiritual needs, although they differ significantly in the degree to which they use mobilize adherents' time and commitment.

The sociologist [[Paul Schnabel]] has argued that the [[Church of Scientology]] originated from an ''audience cult'' (the readership of Hubbard's book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and the ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' article which had preceded it) into a ''client cult'' ([[Dianetics]]) then into a cult movement (the Church of Scientology).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel, Paul]] ''Tussen stigma en charisma: nieuwe religieuze bewegingen en geestelijke volksgezondheid''/''Between stigma and charisma: new religious movements and mental health'' [[Erasmus University]] Rotterdam, Faculty of Medicine, Ph.D. thesis, Dutch language, {{ISBN|90-6001-746-3}} (Deventer, Van Loghum Slaterus, 1982), pages 82, 84-88 &lt;br&gt;literal English translation: "Scientology is a fully developed innovative cult movement [...] Scientology grew out of a client cult (Dianetic) and an audience cult (Hubbard's books)"&lt;br&gt;Dutch original: "Scientology is een volledig ontwikkelde innovatieve cult movement [...] Scientology is voortgekomen uit een client cult (Dianetics) en een audience cult (de boeken van Hubbard)."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roy Wallis ===
The sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] introduced a classification system of [[new religious movement]]s based on movements' views on and relationships with [[society|the world at large]].&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saliba pages 140-141"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* ''World-rejecting movements'' view the prevailing social order as deviant and a perversion of the divine plan. Such movements see the world as evil or at least as [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. They may adhere to [[millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs. The [[International Society of Krishna Consciousness]] (a.k.a. "Hare Krishnas"), the [[Unification Church]], the [[Brahma Kumaris]] and the [[Family International|Children of God]] exemplify world-rejecting movements.
* ''World-accommodating movements'' draw clear distinctions between the spiritual and the worldly spheres. They have few or no consequences for the lives of adherents. These movements adapt to the world but they do not reject or affirm it.
* ''World-affirming movements'' might not have any [[ritual]]s or any formal [[ideology]]. They may lack most of the characteristics of religious movements. They affirm the world and merely claim to have the means to enable people to unlock their "[[Human Potential Movement|hidden potential]]". As examples of world-affirming movements, Wallis mentions [[Werner Erhard]]'s [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]].

'''Souphanouvong University''' is a university in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].

==History==
Souphanouvong University (SU) is a university in [[Luang Prabang]], the old capital of [[Laos]] and its fourth largest city. It is one of five national universities in the [[Lao PDR]]. It was established in accordance with the [[Prime Minister Decree, No 169/PM]], dated 4 November 2003, and inaugurated on the following day. The University is named after [[Prince Souphanouvong]], who was the first President of the [[Lao PDR]].

According to the [[Prime Minister Decree on the Organization and Activities of Souphanouvong University, No 099/PM]], dated 3 April 2009, SU is a public national educational and cultural institution under the Ministry of Education. The University carries out the educational functions of preparing specialists, researchers and multidisciplinary scientific scholars; organizing scientific research; protecting and promoting Lao’s unique national and multiethnic arts and culture; and delivering academic services to society.

Souphanouvong University has two campuses. The main campus, in [[Ban Donmay]] 9&amp;nbsp;km along 13th Northern Road, covers an area of 110 hectares. The SU Faculty of Education, the second campus, covers a land area of 2 hectares and is in [[Ban Nasang-Veuy]], much closer to the city.

==Programmes and courses==
[[File:20141015 085413 resized.jpg|thumb|SU's auditorium]]
Souphanouvong University currently runs 20 undergraduate bachelor's degrees, each of 4-year duration.

The Faculty of Education offers three degree programmes: Lao language and literacy, English, and mathematics.

The Faculty of Economics and Tourism has six programmes: economics, general business management, tourism management, IT business management, international business management, and finance and banking.

The Faculty of Agriculture and Forest Resources offers four programmes: plant science, animal science, forest resources, and food science and technology.

The Faculty of Engineering has three programmes: electrical engineering, computer engineering, and civil engineering.

The Faculty of Architecture offers two programmes: architecture and interior design.

The Faculty of Languages has two programmes and two centres: Lao language, general English language, [[Korean Language Centre]] and the [[Chinese Language Centre]].

==Administrative matters==
[[File:20141015 085618 resized 1.jpg|thumb|SU's main administration building]]
Souphanouvong University is administered by nine offices: the offices of general administration, finance, accommodation and services, academic affairs, student affairs, organization and personnel, planning and international coordination, research and scientific services, and library and ICT.

The University recruits students who have graduated from upper secondary education (USE) with the certificate of [[International Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]].

Classes are conducted in whole working days from Monday to Friday. Regular courses run from 0800 to 1600hrs.

Academic year begins on 16 October and ends 15 July. It has two semesters: first semester is 16 October to 15 February; second semester is 1 March to 15 July.
The University organizes supplement recovery courses for failed students in August.

The University budget is allocated by the Central Government of [[Lao PDR]]. Additional budget comes from charged tuition fees, facility rentals, provincial and community contributions, and international aid.

There are some 400 salary staff and lecturers and the university accepts on average 800 new students each year.

==International relations &amp; cooperation==
[[File:Australian honorary prefessors volunteering at SU.JPG|thumb|SU opens its doors to unsponsored international volunteers]]
Souphanouvong University has established academic relations and cooperation with 33 universities and organizations in neighboring countries such as [[Vietnam]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Republic of Korea]].

The main cooperation activities are focused on scholar and student exchanges, library book and computer supply, as well as co-organizing international seminars, workshops and meetings.

The University accepts volunteers and applications can be made through NGOs, government, and more recently through individual offers made directly to the University. In volunteering, people must have a tangible skill to offer. There is a constant need for English language support for academic staff, as well as helping students with English (especially pronunciation and diction). The University prefers longer term stays than those of a month, so an entire semester or full year is encouraged.

"'''Techne'''" is a term, etymologically derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Wikt:τέχνη|τέχνη]] ({{IPA-el|tékʰnɛː|anc}}, {{IPA-el|ˈtexni|mod|Ell-Techni.ogg}}), that is often translated as "craftsmanship", "craft", or "art".

==Description==
Techne is a term in philosophy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_titles__t134.html oxfordreference.com website] Retrieved 2011-12-03 {{ISBN|0198661320}} (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which resembles ''[[Episteme|epistēmē]]'' in the implication of knowledge of principles, although techne differs in that its intent is making or doing as opposed to disinterested understanding. [[Martin Heidegger]] maintains that the concept for the ancients goes together with ''episteme'', particularly citing [[Plato]] who used the two terms interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gods and Technology: A Reading of Heidegger|last=Rojcewicz|first=Richard|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791466414|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that techne and episteme simply mean knowing and "both words are names for knowledge in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bioethics and Biolaw through Literature|last=Carpi|first=Daniela|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2011|isbn=9783110252842|location=Boston|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an activity, techne is concrete, variable, and context-dependent. As one observer has argued, techne "was not concerned with the necessity and eternal ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths of the [[cosmos]], nor with the ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' contingencies and exigencies of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. [...] Moreover, this was a kind of knowledge associated with people who were bound to necessity. That is, techne was chiefly operative in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], in farming and slavery, and not in the free realm of the Greek polis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/pew.0.0045 |jstor=40213567 |last=Young |first=Damon A. |year=2009 |title=Bowing to Your Enemies: Courtesy, ''Budō'', and Japan |journal=Philosophy East &amp; West |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=188–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] saw it as representative of the imperfection of human imitation of nature. For the [[ancient Greeks]], it signified all the [[mechanic arts]], including medicine and music. The English [[aphorism]], "gentlemen don't work with their hands", is said to have originated in ancient Greece in relation to their [[cynical]] view on the arts. Due to this view, it was only fitted for the lower class while the upper class practiced the [[liberal arts]] of 'free' men (Dorter 1973).

Socrates also compliments techne only when it was used in the context of ''epistēmē''. ''Epistēmē'' sometimes means knowing how to do something in a craft-like way. The craft-like knowledge is called a ''technê''. It is most useful when the knowledge is practically applied, rather than theoretically or aesthetically applied. For the ancient Greeks, when techne appears as art, it is most often viewed negatively, whereas when used as a [[craft]] it is viewed positively because a craft is the practical application of an art, rather than art as an end in itself. In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', written by [[Plato]], the knowledge of [[Theory of Forms|forms]] "is the indispensable basis for the philosophers' craft of ruling in the city" (Stanford 2003). Techne is often used in philosophical discourse to distinguish from art (or ''[[poiesis]]''). {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Usage in art history===
"In fact, techne and ars referred less to a class of objects than to the human ability to make and perform ... the issue is not about the presence or absence of a word but about the interpretation of a body of evidence, and I believe there is massive evidence that the ancient Greeks and Romans had no category of fine art." (Shiner 2001 pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20)

In his work [[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|''The Invention of Art'']], Larry Shiner argues that techne cannot be simply translated to art nor either simply to craft. This being due to art and craft being socially constructed at a certain period in history.

===Techne as an art in rhetoric===
Techne is often used as a term to further define the process of rhetoric as an art of persuasion.  In his writing Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric, rhetoric scholar Dr. [[John Poulakos]] explains how the [[Sophist]]s believed rhetoric to be an art that aimed for terpis, or aesthetic pleasure, while maintaining a medium of [[logos]]. For centuries, debate between sophists and followers of [[Plato]] has ensued over whether rhetoric can be considered a form of art based on the different definitions of techne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulakos |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year=1983 |month= |title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric |journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=36–37 |jstor=40237348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting from others, [[Isocrates]] saw rhetoric as an art—yet in the form of a set of rules, or a handbook.  Some examples of handbooks are the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric of Aristotle]]'', the ''[[Rhetoric to Alexander|Rhetorica ad Alexandrum]]'', and the ''[[De Inventione|De Inventione of Cicero]]'', all composed of rules to write effective speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papillion |first=Terry |year=1995 |title=Isocrates' ''techne'' and Rhetorical Pedagogy |journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly |volume=25 |pages=149–163 |jstor=3886281 |doi=10.1080/02773949509391038}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it can be seen in David Roochnik's book of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne that Plato viewed techne as "a stable body of reliable knowledge able to tell us, in fixed terms readily teachable to others, how we ought to live." He believed that moral knowledge is equivalent to a techne and that the meaning of the term techne must be fully grasped to understand the nature of moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roochnik |first=David |authorlink= |title=Of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |series= |volume= |edition= |year=1996 |location=University Park, PA |pages=xi–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato wrote that rhetoric is not techne but a habit of a bold and ready wit. Plato continued saying rhetoric is not an art but an experience because it fails to explain the nature of its own application. He compared it to cookery and medicine saying cookery pretends to know what is best for the body because it is pleasurable while medicine knows what is for the best of the health of the human body. Medicine is techne for it seeks what is best for the health of a person unlike cookery which is only for pleasure and fools a person into believing it is better for their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first=Plato |authorlink= |author2= |year=1952 |month= |title=Gorgias |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=17–19 |id= |url=https://courseweb.pitt.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-16260281-dt-content-rid-10200501_2/courses/2144_UPITT_COMMRC_0310_SEC1100/Platos%20Gorgias.pdf |accessdate= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Parry writes Aristotle believed techne aims for good and forms an end, which could be the activity itself or a product formed from the activity. Aristotle used health as an example of an end that is produced from the techne of medicine. To make a distinction between techne and arete he said the value of techne is the end product while arete values choosing the action that promotes the best moral good.

===Communication as techne===
Techne is also a part of communication, and affects how human cultures interact. When people speak to one another, they apply their knowledge of social interactions, verbal and nonverbal cues, and their shared language to the skill of speaking. It is both personal and social, everybody has their own personal techne around their speech based on learned experiences and personal tics, and very social in that communities all communicate amongst each other on the interpersonal and large scale. 

In relation to communication, techne is based less on what a person says or thinks, but on what they do. The mechanical action of speaking is mostly unconscious, and most of the work takes place in the centers of the brain similar to how a pianist knows where his fingers should go even without looking (Shepard). As Jonathan Sterne puts it, "Communication requires both language and technology – and both are forms of techne." (Shepard) In relation to technology, the use of a cell phone or any other communicative device requires both an understanding of how the phone works and how social interactions are supposed to be handled on the telephone, but also requires that a person actively does it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shepard|first= Gregory J. |author2= Jeffrey St. John |author3= Theodore G. Striphas |year=2006 |chapter=Communication as Techne |title= Communication as... Perspectives on Theory |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Techne'' and ''technik'' ===
''Techne'' can also be compared or distinguished from the German conceptualization of the term ''technik'', which referred both to the material composition of industry as well as to the rules, procedures, and skills used to achieve a particular end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and Isolation|last=Lawson|first=Clive|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107180833|location=Cambridge|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing of [[Thorstein Veblen]] eventually linked this concept with technology particularly in his evaluation of the works of [[Gustav von Schmoller|Gustav Schmoller]] and [[Werner Sombart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schatzberg|first=Eric|date=2006-08-07|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology before 1930|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/201479|journal=Technology and Culture|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=486–512|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0201|issn=1097-3729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of ''techne'' (art) and ''technik'' (technology) is viewed to share a commonality - that both are ways in which beings as a whole may be brought to light.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Vinegar|first=Aron|last2=Boetzkes|first2=Amanda|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2014|isbn=9781409456131|location=Surrey|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while ''techne'' maintains a relation to nature's capacity for self-disclosure, ''technik'' severs it through a regulatory attack that provokes nature to give up its latent power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Heidegger, ''technik'' - by contrast to ''techne'' -  refuses "to let earth be an earth."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ten Sing is an international Youth programme within the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) and YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association), which focuses on getting young people to express themselves by using their own culture through creative performing arts.

'''The main aims'''

The underlying objectives are leadership training, democracy training and personal and social development of body, mind and spirit. Ten Sing invites young people to a creative work process that uses different cultural expressions in a Christian context.

'''The three C's'''

The three C's "Culture, Creativity and Christ" are equally important parts of the Ten Sing idea.

'''By young people, for young people.'''

Young people know best what young people think, dream of, feel and desire. Therefore, young people should be active in the management of Ten Sing and take responsibility for running programmes themselves.

'''Young responsibility, adult presence'''

Ten Sing is for young people, with young people and run by young people. Even though the young people are responsible for the programme, it is important to have adult presence. Adults should act as mentors for the youth leaders. The adults should be a resource for help, support and advice when needed.

'''The whole human being'''

Everybody has talents that can be used in Ten Sing, and everyone should get the chance to be creative and active with his or her own mind and body, thus stimulating their spirit. This happens through a great variety of performing arts, such as music, dance, drama, video and other creative expressions. The Ten Sing programme focuses on "the whole human being", with spirit, mind and body. The YMCA-logo – the triangle – illustrates that all parts are equally important.

'''Process before product'''

To reach the goal of developing young people, Ten Sing focuses on the process of making a creative performance. The process is the tool to make everybody contribute. Therefore, the young people should develop both social and creative skills.

This is why the process itself is the key: Letting the young people work together regularly in a safe environment, trying and failing, challenging each other, developing and growing, whilst creating a product that the young people can enjoy and be proud of. This enables them to reflect and value their achievements and skills gained through the process.

'''Open membership, Christian leadership'''

Ten Sing is open to everyone irrespective of gender, beliefs, abilities, talents, ethnic and social background. It is not necessary to be a Christian to be a member of Ten Sing. Nevertheless, to secure the Christian context of Ten Sing it's important that at least one of the key leaders is a Christian.

==Origin==
Ten Sing originated from [[Norway]] in 1968. The name "Ten Sing" is a combination of the Norwegian [[suffix]] "-ten" (en. "-teen") and the English word "sing" – a kind of language mixing that was quite common in Norway at the time.

The first Ten Sing group was started in [[Bergen]] by Kjell Grønner. It was inspired by Sing Out, which later became known as [[Up with People]]. The years that followed more groups were formed in Norway, and today there are over hundred groups all over Norway. The Norwegian [[YWCA]]–[[YMCA]]  wanted to implement Ten Sing in other European countries, and the starting point was Germany in 1986. This was the start of Ten Sing Norwegen, now Ten Sing Norway.

The first European Ten Sing Conference was held in 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">"'''Ecotourism with a Hand Lens'''" is a term coined by Dr. [[Ricardo Rozzi]]&lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R., J. Armesto, B. Goffinet, W. Buck, F. Massardo, J. Silander, Jr., M.T.K. Arroyo, S. Russell, C.B. Anderson, L. Cavieres &amp; J.B. Callicott (2008). Changing biodiversity conservation lenses: Insights from the subantarctic non-vascular flora of southern South America. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 6:131-137&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues to refer to a new speciality tourism being promoted in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Given the discovery of the archipelago's outstanding diversity of mosses, lichens and liverworts (5% of the world's total), Rozzi has called upon tourism operators to place this narrative into their offering for the region and take advantage of this biodiversity hotspot for non-vascular flora.&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, E., M. T. K. Arroyo, P. H. Raven, and H. Mooney. 2008. Omora Ethnobotanical Park and the UNESCO Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Ecology and Society 13(2): 49. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss2/art49/&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Rozzi and the [[Omora Ethnobotanical Park]] have metaphorically called these small plant communities the '''"Miniature Forests of Cape Horn"''' to help the broader society understand the ecological role played by these tiny, but diverse, abundant and important organisms. In the Magellanic Subantarctic ecoregion, the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve and the Chilean Antarctic Peninsula, the number of foreign
tourists has doubled in the last decade, with nature tourism being the principal attraction for visitors to the region. With the aim of preventing negative impacts of tourism activity on the biological and cultural diversity, and to contribute to sustainable tourism the Sub-Antarctic Biocultural Conservation Program at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, in collaboration with local actors, has developed the field environmental philosophy methodological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Rozzi, Ximena Arango, Francisca Massardo, Christopher Anderson, Kurt Heidinger, Kelli Moses. 2008. Field Environmental Philosophy and Biocultural Conservation: The Omora Ethnobotanical Park Educational Program. Environmental Ethics 30 (3): 325-336. [online] URL: {{cite web |url=http://www.secure.pdcnet.org/enviroethics/content/enviroethics_2008_0030_0003_0325_0336 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909135054/http://www.secure.pdcnet.org/enviroethics/content/enviroethics_2008_0030_0003_0325_0336 |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field environmental philosophy  methodology integrates ecological sciences and environmental ethics through a four-step cycle consisting of: (i) interdisciplinary ecological and philosophical research; (ii) composition of metaphors and communication of simple narratives; (iii) design of field activities guided with an ecological and an ethical orientation; and (iv) implementation of in situ conservation areas. Under the perspective of field environmental philosophy we have defined ecotourism as “an invitation to have a tour or trip to share and appreciate the oikos of the diverse human and nonhuman inhabitants, their habits and habitats.” &lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R. J.J. Armesto, J. Gutierrez, F. Massardo, G. Likens et al. 2012. Integrating Ecology and Environmental Ethics: Earth Stewardship in the Southern End of the Americas. BioScience 62(3): 226-236&lt;/ref&gt; This methodological approach is implemented with the activity of “ecotourism with a hand-lens” at Omora Park. "Ecotourism with a hand-lens” aims to demonstrate that when adequately planned and administered, ecotourism can contribute to biocultural conservation hand in hand with environmental, economic, and social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Galapagos and Cape Horn: Ecotourism or Greenwashing in Two Emblematic Latin American Archipelagoes? Ricardo Rozzi, Francisca Massardo, Felipe Cruz, Christophe Grenier, Andrea Muñoz &amp; Eduard Mueller. 2010.

"Tourism with a hand lens" has been likened to a nature-venerating ritual by the ethnographer [[Bron Taylor]] in his book ''[[Bron Taylor|Dark Green Religion]].''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. 2010.

[[Women]] have served in the [[military]] in various roles and in various jurisdictions throughout history.

Since 1914, in western militaries, women have served in greater numbers and more diverse roles than before. In the 1970s, most [[Women in the military by country|Western armies]] began allowing women to serve in active duty in all military branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carreiras, Helena |title=Gender and the military: women in the armed forces of western democracies |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-415-38358-5 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h_teNrU9k6QC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nine countries women are [[conscription|conscripted]] into military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the military — international|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/military-international/|website=www.cbc.ca|accessdate=17 Nov 2017|date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway becomes first NATO country to draft women into military|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-women-conscription-idUSBRE95D0NB20130614|agency=Reuters Staff|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=17 Nov 2017|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few countries allow women to serve on an equal basis.

==History==
===World War I===
{{Main|Women in World War I}}During the [[World War I|First World War]], the United States was in total warfare efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&amp;isbn=&amp;issn=00028762&amp;title=American%20Historical%20Review&amp;volume=123&amp;issue=4&amp;date=20181001&amp;atitle=Lynn%20Dumenil.%20The%20Second%20Line%20of%20Defense:%20American%20Women%20and%20World%20War%20I;%20Elizabeth%20Cobbs.%20The%20Hello%20Girls:%20America's%20First%20Women%20Soldiers.&amp;aulast=Hendrickson,%20Mark&amp;spage=1332&amp;sid=EBSCO:America:%20History%20&amp;%20Life&amp;pages=1332-1334|title=Journals at the LMU William H. Hannon Library|website=sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every person had to help in contributing to the war.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone needed to fight.  The country needed to continue to fund their troops and support the war financially while soldiers were fighting.  The United States relied on organizations to support the war efforts.  Women joined organizations such as the [[Committee on Public Information]] in order to educate people about the war.  This committee additionally promoted nationality.  In addition to working for committees having to do with education, women worked in all sorts of positions.  Many women became [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] members and bravely went overseas to help soldiers.  This was the first time in history that women of all classes were working together to help the war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/women-in-wwi|title=Women in World War I|website=National Museum of American History|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper class women founded many voluntary war organizations while middle and lower class women worked in these organizations by working as nurses or by filling in the jobs of men.

Although all women were working to help their country, many women of color faced prejudice during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0005/e1286|title=Oxford AASC: Home|website=www.oxfordaasc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the war effort, many African American families moved from rural farms to urban cities.  African American women were given the most hard working jobs with the lowest pay.  Many organizations were formed, such as the Colored YWCA, to support African American women.  These organizations helped these women find safe homes and stable jobs.  They also hired many social workers to make it certain that employers treated women of color equally.  Towards the end of World War I, black women were legally allowed to travel overseas to help the [[Red Cross]].  Many women from the Association of Colored Graduate Nurses were the first African Americans to help the Red Cross.  Although this is a step in the right direction, the United States still has a long way to reduce prejudice and provide equal rights for African American women and people of color as a whole.  

===Russia===
The only nation to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was [[Russia]]. From the onset, female recruits either joined the military in disguise or were tacitly accepted by their units. The most prominent were a contingent of front-line [[light cavalry]] in a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] regiment commanded by a female colonel, [[Alexandra Kudasheva]]. Others included [[Maria Bochkareva]], who was decorated three times and promoted to senior NCO rank, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a group of twelve schoolgirls from Moscow had enlisted together disguised as young men.&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Sowers, Women Combatants in World War I: A Russian Case Study" (Strategy Research Project, U.S. Army War College, 2003) [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA414547 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] raised a number of "[[Women's Battalion]]s", with Bochkareva given an officer's commission in command. They fought well, but failed to provide the propaganda value expected of them and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later [[Russian Civil War]], they fought both for the [[Bolsheviks]] (infantry) and the [[White movement|White Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reese|first=Roger R.|title=The Soviet military experience: a history of the Soviet Army, 1917–1991|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2000|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In [[Serbia]], a few individual women played key military roles. Scottish doctor [[Elsie Inglis|Elsie Ingles]] coordinated a retreat of approximately 8,000 Serbian troops through Romania and revolutionary Russia, up to Scandinavia and finally onto transport ships back to England .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SAVED 8,000 SERBS, BUT DIED IN EFFORT: Heroic Work Of Dr. Elsie Ingles Told by Woman Just Here from the Front.|last=|first=|date=February 11, 1918|work=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SERBIAN ARMY LED BY WOMAN: DRAMATIC RETREAT THROUGH RUSSIA|last=|first=|date=April 30, 1918|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another woman, [[Milunka Savić|Milunka Savic]], enlisted in the Serbian army in place of her brother.

In 1917 [[Loretta Walsh]] became the first woman to enlist as a woman. A 1948 law made women a permanent part of the military services. In 1976, the first group of women were admitted into a U.S. military academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://norfolkdailynews.com/interactive/onlineextras/women-in-the-military/article_a21c355a-d822-11e2-87e3-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Women in the military|date=8 June 2013|newspaper=Norfolk Daily News|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 16% of the 2013 [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] class consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/22/239260015/west-point-women-a-natural-pattern-or-a-camouflage-ceiling|title=West Point Women: A Natural Pattern Or A Camouflage Ceiling?|last1=Abramson|first1=Larry|date=22 October 2013|website=NPR.org|language=en|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], more than 2,000 women fought in the [[Women's Red Guards of the Finnish Civil War|Women's Red Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xCJBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fi&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy|last=Lintunen|first=Tiina|date=2014|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=978-900-42436-6-8|location=Leiden|pages=201–229|chapter=Women at War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 and 1991, some 40,000 American military women were deployed during the [[Gulf War]] operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; however, no women served in combat. A policy enacted in 1994 prohibited women from assignment to ground combat units below the brigade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/|title=Military leaders lift ban on women in combat roles|last=Fischel|first=Justin|date=24 January 2013|newspaper=Fox|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{see also|Women in the World Wars}}
[[File:Hrh_Princess_Elizabeth_in_the_Auxiliary_Territorial_Service,_April_1945_TR2832.jpg|thumb|left| Then-Princess Elizabeth served in the British Army, during the 1940s.]]

[[File:Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roza Shanina]], a Soviet sniper during [[World War II]], credited with 54 confirmed target hits. About 400,000 Soviet women served in front-line duty units,&lt;ref name="D'Ann Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=D'Ann |title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union |journal=[[Journal of Military History]] |year=1993 |volume=57 |issue= 2|pages=301–323 |url=http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/women-combat.htm |doi=10.2307/2944060|jstor=2944060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; chiefly as medics and nurses.]]

All the major participating nations in [[World War II]] enlisted women. The majority served as nursing and clerical or support roles. Over 500,000 women had combat roles in anti-aircraft units in Britain and Germany, as well as front-line units in the Soviet Union.

====United Kingdom====
In 1938, the [[British Empire|British]] took the lead in establishing uniformed services for women (small units of nurses had long been in service). In late 1941, Britain began conscripting women, sending most into factories and some into the military, especially the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) attached to the army. The ATS began as a women's auxiliary in 1938. In 1941, the ATS was granted military status, although women received only [[Gender pay gap|two thirds of male pay]]. Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1 missiles]]. The daughter of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was there, and he gushed that any general who saved him 40,000 fighting men had gained the equivalent of a victory. By August 1941, women were operating fire-control instruments; although they were never allowed to pull the trigger, since killing the enemy was considered to be too masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. J. |last=DeGroot |title=Whose Finger on the Trigger?

====Germany====
The [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] had similar roles for women. The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-Helferinnen were regarded as part of the SS if they had undergone training at a Reichsschule SS. All other female workers were contracted to the SS and chosen largely from [[internment|concentration camps]]. Women served in auxiliary units in the navy (Kriegshelferinnen), air force (Luftnachrichtenhelferinnen) and army (Nachrichtenhelferin).&lt;ref name="Gordon Williamson 2003"&gt;Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karen Hagemann 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagemann | first1 = Karen | year = 2011 | title = Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women's War Service in the Two World Wars | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 1055–1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944-45 roughly 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the [[Bundeswehr|German armed forces]] (Bundeswehr). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Hagemann 2011"/&gt; In the [[Luftwaffe]] they served in combat roles helping to operate anti-aircraft systems to shoot down Allied bombers. By 1945, German women held 85% of the billets as clerics, accountants, interpreters, laboratory workers and administrative workers, together with half of the clerical and junior administrative posts in high-level field headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=D'Ann |last=Campbell | title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union | journal = Journal of Military History | date=April 1993 | volume =57 |pages =301–323 | url = http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.htm | doi=10.2307/2944060 | issue=2|jstor=2944060 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German nursing service consisted of four main organizations, one for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], one for [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the secular DRK (Red Cross) and the "Brown Nurses," for committed [[Nazism|Nazi]] women. Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals close to the front lines and at risk of attack. Two dozen were awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for heroism under fire.&lt;ref name="Gordon Williamson 2003"/&gt; Brown Nurses were forced to look away while their incapacitated patients were murdered by [[War crime|war criminals]].&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland-Icke, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of women auxiliaries (Aufseherin) served in the SS in the camps, the majority of which were at [[Ravensbrück]]. 

In Germany women worked and were told by Hitler to produce more pure [[Aryan race|Aryan]] children to fight in future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp, ''Mobilizing Women For War: German and American Propaganda, 1939-1945'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese American Women'''

During the second world war, many Japanese American women lost their jobs or pay because they were sent to [[Internment|relocation camps]].  Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans were faced with discrimination.  Many Americans called it the “yellow peril”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan Lynn|date=1999-12-01|title=Women Health Workers and the Color Line in the Japanese American "Relocation Centers" of World War II|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/4392|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|language=en|volume=73|issue=4|pages=585–601|doi=10.1353/bhm.1999.0190|pmid=10615767|issn=1086-3176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called Japanese people “japs”.  In 1913, California passed the [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law]] which prohibited “aliens ineligible for citizenship” from owning land to grow crops on.  Despite the discrimination, many Japanese American women volunteered to serve in the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps|Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps]].  Sexism along with racism was something that these women faced when they joined WAAC.  Even while dealing with discrimination, Japanese American women were able to greatly help the United States.  Many women were hired as interpreters, translators, and interrogators in the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]].  In 1948, the Women’s Army Corps was permanently established and remained until 1978 when women were allowed into the army.

====Yugoslav Partisans====
 {{main|Women in the Yugoslav Partisans}}
The [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav National Liberation Movement]] had 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the [[Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia|Antifascist Front of Women]] (AFŽ), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AFŽ managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav National Liberation Army]]. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jancar | first1 = Barbara | year = 1981 | title = Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview | url = | journal = Studies in Comparative Communism | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 143–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, although women were relegated to traditional gender roles, Yugoslavia's historians emphasized women's roles in the resistance. After Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s, women's contributions to the resistance were forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drapac | first1 = Vesna | year = 2009 | title = Resistance and the Politics of Daily Life in Hitler's Europe: The Case of Yugoslavia in a Comparative Perspective | url = | journal = Aspasia | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 55–78 | doi=10.3167/asp.2009.030104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar-Webster, ''Women and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941–1945'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
Though relatively little official data exists about female [[Vietnam War]] veterans, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation estimates that approximately 11,000 military women were stationed in Vietnam during the conflict. Nearly all of them were volunteers, and 90 percent served as military nurses, though women also worked as physicians, air traffic controllers, intelligence officers, clerks and other positions in the U.S. Women’s Army Corps, U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marines and the Army Medical Specialist Corps. In addition to women in the armed forces, an unknown number of civilian women served in Vietnam on behalf of the Red Cross, United Service Organizations (USO), Catholic Relief Services and other humanitarian organizations, or as foreign correspondents for various news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/11/vietnam-war-timeline-u-s-involvement-over-decades/653693001/|title=Vietnam War: A timeline of U.S. entanglement|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the U.S. military women who served in Vietnam, an unknown number of female civilians willingly gave their services on Vietnamese soil during the conflict. Many of them worked on behalf of the [[American Red Cross]], Army Special Services, United Service Organizations (USO), [[Peace Corps]], and various religious groups such as Catholic Relief Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/01/world/vietnam-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Vietnam War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other American women traveled to Vietnam as foreign correspondents for news organizations, including Georgette “Dickey” Chappelle, a writer for the National Observer who was killed by a mine while on patrol with U.S. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linus.lmu.edu/search~S2?/yvietnam+war/yvietnam+war/-3%2C0%2C0%2CB/eresource&amp;FF=ywomen+and+social+movements+in+the+united+states+1600+2000&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Marines outside Chu Lai in November 1965. According to the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, 59 female civilians died during the conflict. 

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
[[File:Congolese female para-commando 1967.jpg|thumb|200px|A Congolese female para-commando during jump training at capital Leopoldville in 1967]]
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] began training an initial 150 women as para-commandos for the [[Armée Nationale Congolaise]] in 1967. Many more were trained subsequently, over a period of years. The women received parachute and weapons training, although it is unclear to what extent they were actually integrated into the combat units of the Congo. 

===Eritrea===
In 1999, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reported that about a quarter of the [[Eritrea]]n soldiers in the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea's women fighters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/07/99/battle_in_the_horn/396183.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law granted equal opportunities in the military to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. Women started to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named [[Caracal Battalion|Carakal]] were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the [[Israeli Border Police|Border Police]].&lt;ref name="feldinger" /&gt;

Despite these changes, fewer than 4 percent of women service members are in combat positions such as infantry, crew of tanks or other armored vehicles, artillery guns service, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in "combat-support".&lt;ref name="Gaza: It's a Man's War"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/gaza-a-mans-war-israel-gender/375689/ Gaza: It's a Man's War] The Atlantic, 7 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations allow female soldiers to serve in certain combat arms positions. Others exclude them for various reasons including physical demands and privacy policies. Among the NATO nations, and as of the mid-1970s, women were able to attain military status in the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Non-conscription countries, notably the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada are where the highest levels of female military presences were achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Sandra Carson|last2=Segal|first2=Mady Wechsler|date=July 1988|title=Military Women in NATO: An Update|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=559–585|doi=10.1177/0095327x8801400405|issn=0095-327X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is marked as particularly progressive in its early implementation of gender equality practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p28m|title=How a Century of War Changed the Lives of Women|last=GERMAN|first=LINDSEY|date=2013|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9780745332505}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rise in the call for equal opportunity coupled with the decline of able-bodied men willing to enter military service coaxed countries to reform policies toward female inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Sandra Carson|last2=Segal|first2=Mady Wechsler|date=July 1988|title=Military Women in NATO: An Update|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=559–585|doi=10.1177/0095327x8801400405|issn=0095-327X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===United States===
The [[United States military]] opens all positions to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Jobs For Women: Different Positions For Women In The Military - Militaro|url=http://militaro.com/army-jobs-for-women|website=militaro.com|accessdate=7 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329005503/http://militaro.com/army-jobs-for-women|archivedate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units such as [[United States Special Forces|Special Forces]] require members to meet extraordinary requirements, and no females have met them in some units.

====History====
Women have been involved in the U.S. military since 1775, originally in the civilian fields of nursing, laundering, mending clothing and cooking. 

[[Deborah Sampson]] was one of the first women to enlist while disguised as a man. She was unhappy with her limited role in the [[American Revolution]]. She served in a light infantry unit, fighting in many battles. Injuries put her in a hospital where her secret was discovered. Her commanding officer, General John Paterson, honorably discharged her and thanked her for her service.&lt;ref name="graduate.norwich.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://graduate.norwich.edu/resources-mmh/articles-mmh/how-roles-have-changed-for-women-in-the-military/|title=How Roles Have Changed for Women in the Military {{!}} Norwich Online Graduate Degrees|website=graduate.norwich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several hundred women enlisted and fought in the [[US Civil War]], generally disguised as men. In some cases their identity was discovered, typically on the battlefield or in hospitals after becoming wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/untold-stories/female-soldiers-in-the-civil.html|title=Female soldiers in the Civil War on the front line|last=Smith|first=Sam|website=www.civilwar.org|accessdate=17 November 2017|date=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1917 [[Loretta Walsh]] became the first woman to enlist as a woman. A 1948 law made women a permanent part of the military services. In 1976, the first group of women were admitted into a U.S. military academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women in the military|url=http://norfolkdailynews.com/interactive/onlineextras/women-in-the-military/article_a21c355a-d822-11e2-87e3-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=2013-10-24|newspaper=Norfolk Daily News|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 16% of the 2013 [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] class consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramson|first1=Larry|title=West Point Women: A Natural Pattern Or A Camouflage Ceiling?|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/22/239260015/west-point-women-a-natural-pattern-or-a-camouflage-ceiling|website=NPR.org|accessdate=17 November 2017|language=en|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 and 1991, some 40,000 American military women were deployed during the [[Gulf War]] operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; however, no women served in combat. A policy enacted in 1994 prohibited women from assignment to ground combat units below the brigade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischel|first=Justin|title=Military leaders lift ban on women in combat roles|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=Fox|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Policy changes====
Until 1993, 67 percent of the positions in the Army were open to women. 

In 2013, 15.6 percent of the [[United States Army|Army's]] 1.1 million soldiers, including [[Army National Guard|National Guard]] And [[United States Army Reserve|Reserve]], were female, serving in 95 percent of occupations.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/110447/Sisters_in_Arms__Breaking_down_barriers_and_rising_to_the_challenge/|title=Sisters in Arms: Breaking down barriers and rising to the challenge|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 78 percent of the positions{{Clarify|reason=positions vs occupations?

In January 2013, the US ended the policy of "no women in units that are tasked with direct combat".&lt;ref name="armywomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/118930/Army_to_open_33_000_positions_to_female_Soldiers_in_April/|title=Army to open 33,000 positions to female Soldiers in April|author=C.

In 2013 female U.S Army soldiers enrolled in a training course designed by [[Combined Joint Task Force Paladin]], specifically designed for Female Engagement Team members. The course was intended to train female soldiers for tasks such as [[unexploded ordnance]] awareness, [[biometrics]], [[Forensic science|forensics]], evidence collection, tactical questioning, vehicle and personnel searches and homemade explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drohan|first=Ed|title=CJTF Paladin offers training for female engagement team members|url=http://www.army.mil/article/111974/CJTF_Paladin_offers_training_for_Female_Engagement_Team_members/|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By May 2015, none of the nineteen women vying to become the first female [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] had passed [[Ranger School]]. Eleven of the nineteen dropped out in the first four days. Of the remaining eight who failed in the next step, three were given the option to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michaels|first1=Jim|title=Women in Ranger School fail to finish grueling course|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/30/ranger-women/28179303/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two graduated in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Mary|last2=Lamothe|first2=Dan|title=How did these two women become the first to complete Army Ranger School?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-did-these-two-women-become-the-first-to-complete-army-rangers-school/2015/08/19/a745c962-46af-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third graduated in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=Army Ranger School has a groundbreaking new graduate: Lisa Jaster, 37, engineer and mother|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/12/army-ranger-school-has-a-groundbreaking-new-graduate-lisa-jaster-37-engineer-and-mother/|accessdate=19 August 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have been injured, killed, and awarded high honors. Two women received the [[Silver Star]]: Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester in 2005 and Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown in 2007 for their actions in combat. Over 10,000 combat action badges were awarded to women who served in combat in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1204-lemmon-women-combat-20151204-story.html|title=Women in combat?

The study assessed a nine-month experiment at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], N.C., and [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]], Calif. About 400 [[Marines]], including 100 women, volunteered to participate.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=Marine experiment finds women get injured more frequently, shoot less accurately than men|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/10/marine-experiment-finds-women-get-injured-more-frequently-shoot-less-accurately-than-men/|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male squads, teams and crews demonstrated better performance on 93 of 134 tasks evaluated (69 percent) than units with women in them. Male units were faster while completing tactical movements in [[combat]] situations, especially in units with large "crew-served" weapons such as heavy machine guns and mortars. Male [[infantry]] squads had better accuracy than squads with women in them, with "a notable difference between genders for every individual weapons system" used by infantry rifleman units. The [[M4 carbine]], [[M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle|M27]] infantry automatic rifle and [[M203]] single-shot [[grenade launcher]] were assessed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Male [[Marines]] who had not received [[infantry]] training were more accurate than women who had. In removing wounded troops from the battlefield, "notable differences in execution times were found between all-male and gender-integrated groups".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

[[Unit cohesion]] was lower in mixed gender units. Many female soldiers reported that the way that they are viewed by male soldiers is often detrimental to their participation. For instance, female soldiers are often labelled as "either standoffish or a slut".&lt;ref name=doan2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doan|first1=Alesha E.|last2=Portillo|first2=Shannon|title=Not a Woman, but a Soldier: Exploring Identity Through Translocational Positionality|journal=Sex Roles|date=2017|volume= 76|issue=3–4|pages=236–249|doi=10.1007/s11199-016-0661-7|hdl=1808/23881}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid such labels, female soldiers have to spend time with fellow soldiers strategically, without spending too much time with any one of them. This approach often has an isolating effect.&lt;ref name=doan2017 /&gt; In several instances, women were considered less skilled than male soldiers, so were not given opportunities to complete tasks for which they were qualified.&lt;ref name=doan2017 /&gt; 

According to Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, author of ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society'', Israeli soldiers reacted with uncontrollable protectiveness and aggression after seeing a woman wounded. Further, Islamic militants rarely, if ever, surrender to female soldiers, lessening the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ability to take prisoners. Iraqi and Afghan civilians are often not intimidated by female soldiers. However, in socially conservative environments, female combat soldiers can search female civilians, while children and women are more likely to talk to female soldiers than to male soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coalitionforveterans.org/2011/04/female-soldiers-say-theyre-up-for-battle/ |title=Coalition for Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Veterans » Blog Archive » Female soldiers say they're up for battle |publisher=Coalitionforveterans.org |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual assault: What it is and the Process ====
Sexual assault is more likely to occur in the military than in the civilian population. One in four active-duty female military personnel will be sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0886260506295347|pmid = 17202575|title = Mental Health, Quality of Life, and Health Functioning in Women Veterans|journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume = 22|issue = 2|pages = 179–197|year = 2007|last1 = Surìs|first1 = Alina|last2 = Lind|first2 = Lisa|last3 = Kashner|first3 = T. Michael|last4 = Borman|first4 = Patricia D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military has a Code Of Justice which defines sexual assault: rape, aggravated assault, abusive sexual assault, nonconsensual sodomy (forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit these acts. 

All of these acts are punishable by military law which begins by the victim going forward to their commander. It is then their job to make an inquiry on the perpetrator, however they also have the right to dismiss the claims.

Many victims in the military describe the response to and aftermath of sexual assault as more painful than the assault itself because of the unspoken "code of silence." The code of silence implicates that women should keep quiet about their assault and not come forward to take action. Women expect that little will be done, so most cases go unreported. When they are reported and taken to court only ten percent of cases have the perpetrator charged for their crimes, which is a reason women won't come forward as they know little will come from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castro|first=Carl Andrew|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Schuyler|first3=Ashley C.|last4=Lucas|first4=Carrie L.|last5=Warner|first5=Christopher H.|date=2015-05-16|title=Sexual Assault in the Military|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=54|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0596-7|pmid=25980511|issn=1523-3812|citeseerx=10.1.1.640.2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female soldiers have developed several techniques for avoiding sexual assault "including: (1) relying on support networks [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[buddy system]]s], (2) capitalizing on their status (associated with rank, age, time spent in military, or prior deployment experience); and, (3) masking femininity through clothing to minimize violence exposure and to keep themselves and others safe during military service".&lt;ref name="cheney2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Ann M.|last2=Reisinger|first2=Heather Schact|last3=Booth|first3=Brenda M.|last4=Mengeling|first4=Michelle A.|last5=Torner|first5=James C.|last6=Sadler|first6=Anne G.|title=Servicewomen's Strategies to Staying Safe During Military Service|journal=Gender Issues|date=March 2015|volume= 32|issue= 1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s12147-014-9128-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such strategies leave the burden of addressing the problem on potential victims.&lt;ref name="cheney2015" /&gt; Conversely, in many units, soldiers pair off as "buddies" who watch out for each other.

==== Effects of sexual Assault ====
Sexual assault leads to many health problems for women in the military such as anxiety disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, binge eating, dissociation and memory impairment, suicidal and parasuicidal behavior, sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction, poor self-esteem, and personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/milmed-d-10-00038.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAkIwggI-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIvMIICKwIBADCCAiQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMjlJ5fV1_Vgl5BwzzAgEQgIIB9RT5h5Zzgszxdu45nuyLb9quGE9LS6S5lXdoJQYaNA5avXHnG8xQJ_o-ube5T6coQoPQbWTaDR5biO4t9ifKoqfgA13LgM2zKy1mo8KSC_2OgvgyhXy2ZQVngkT04dHG3H98sqEnA6Qk-Aili7qRKJM_nWIcPBw7cBtFmEvebi78s2ZHJbLZ0DGVUpvBvcDnNJ-7qaeH2VEjKDeNgSS-Eaovo0JnjcXr72USJpcym-nz5in--vzrHH09x6dAWk2qdID0W4yh7GKIGmjyZAHjA34vveE7PzfkcUlXLXFoVu5M5QcjfheteaQwhmX1102VO1_YsdH6bRt1LqFLBfKaUkxA4-YLBai2frbT6v9LDn1EnKNgrpOxwsf4PFJXUCiaBK19WhzfE50IBuoqQopn1VbjYaHNNFqaiAaHbS3YXkZVzXZCtlcVGBdgBm1gqtRI4DRTZSqD8pU4NLwM5y6p4mRQkU8yyq1hkW1rspXdmwnIEzigVoaLps63IiN3UX8XsF1WzOpDotOqhcl1LZ8jjllNdlFQS-EkU72QONZZsWyBCL-8b0QS5c7GzObIxDQfQYpuvM6sxtIpGr40pmaJa8lhtTFKp4t-plDBL6OE1UcmZD3KRfRIAMuJ_CfI9AiVf4zG9CeAAHnhgzjcS1djVEUig79ihAWomen|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes a toll on their physical health and have reported having menstrual complications, headaches, back pain, gastrointestinal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=22|issue=2|pages=179–197|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260506295347.|language=en|doi=10.1177/0886260506295347|pmid=17202575|year=2007|last1=Surìs|first1=Alina|last2=Lind|first2=Lisa|last3=Kashner|first3=T.

All of these factors make it hard for women to stay in the military, in women it is the leading cause for early leave of the armed forces. Once leaving the military though women have a hard time reintegrating back into society and can end up homeless. It is so debilitating for women in the military because most of their perpetrates are people they work and live with, from peers to a supervisor and higher above. This close relationship creates a new type of trauma as the victim is forced to see them every day and creates an overall lack of trust in people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sexual Assault in the Military|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=17|issue=7|pages=54|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0596-7|pmid=25980511|year = 2015|last1 = Castro|first1 = Carl Andrew|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Schuyler|first3=Ashley C.|last4=Lucas|first4=Carrie L.|last5=Warner|first5=Christopher H.|citeseerx=10.1.1.640.2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Updated military training focuses on bystander interventions and the role of [[consent]] in sexual activity, emphasizing the responsibility of male soldiers.&lt;ref name="weitz2015" /&gt; Some female soldiers assume the classically male role of "protector". This works to change women's "responsibility for preventing rape"&lt;ref name="weitz2015" /&gt; and requires that male soldiers acknowledge their responsibility to engage with female soldiers in all activities.

[[File:Military parade on Red Square 2017-05-09 028.jpg|thumb|Russian female cadets.]]
A 2008 study found that female cadets saw military training as an "opportunity to be strong, assertive and skillful" and saw such training "as an escape from some of the negative aspects of traditional femininity". The female cadets also believed that the ROTC program was "gender-blind" and "gender-neutral". The study claims that female cadets "were hyper-vigilant about their status as women performing tasks traditionally seen as men's work and often felt that they had to constantly prove they were capable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The study quoted one female cadet: "in the Navy the joke is that a woman in the Navy is either a bitch, a slut or a lesbian, and ''none of them are good categories to fall into'', and if you are stern with your people then you are a bitch, but if you're a guy and stern people are like, wow, I respect him for being a good leader."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

84 percent of cadets said they did not want a military career as it would interfere with marriage and raising children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jennifer M.
