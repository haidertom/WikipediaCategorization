{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement World History''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different types of human society. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 [[Common Era|BC]]E to the present day. It was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 CE, starting in the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. The course has undergone multiple changes with the latest changes effective Fall 2017. Often times in the United States, students take the course in their sophomore year of high school, but this is not a requirement.

==Course Structure==
This is a high school course designed specifically for sophomores in high school and gives college credit. The course is organized around six eras/periods and nineteen "Key Concepts":
*'''Period 1''' - Technological and Environmental Transformations, to c. 600 BC

The first section of the AP World History exam consists of 55 multiple choice questions with a 55-minute time limit. The questions are not divided up evenly between the six periods.
&lt;br /&gt;

The multiple choice section is weighted as 40% of one's  total score (Section I Part A). It consists of 55 questions to be answered in 55 minutes based on the accompanying sources.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit.  Note also that the number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test underwent a major re-haul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 &amp; 2, another addressing periods 3 &amp; 4, and a third addressing periods 5 &amp; 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, Trevor Packer, stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, &amp; many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATOMKI main-entrance.JPG|thumb|right|ATOMKI main entrance]]
'''ATOMKI''' is the  '''Institute for Nuclear Research, [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]'''. The institute was established in 1954 by [[Sándor Szalay (physicist)|Sándor Szalay]] the founder director.

ATOMKI became independent from the Institute of Experimental Physics of the Kossuth Lajos University (presently called [[University of Debrecen]]), where Sándor Szalay started and directed [[nuclear physics]] research for decades. At present, the main research fields of Atomki are atom-, nuclear-, and particle physics, ion beam analytics, technique of detection and signal processing, environmental analytics, radioactive dating, radiochemistry, and solid state physics. The director is Zsolt Dombrádi, [[Doctor of Sciences|D.Sc.]].

Some of its buildings were originally the National Orphanage for Teachers' Children, built in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Old photos|url=http://www.atomki.hu/regi_kepek/index_en.html|work=ATOMKI|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26726">'''Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament''' refers to the studies of [[Political groups of the European Parliament|those groups]] by academics, the methods that they use and the conclusions that they reach.

==Background==
{{main|Political groups of the European Parliament}}
The [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] of the [[European Parliament]] have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and the [[European political party|Europarties]] and [[political party|national parties]] that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament.

Some of the groups (such as PES) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue [[manifesto]]s of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the [[party platform]]s of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.

Additionally, national media focus on the MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups ''per se'' is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/ |title=EUobserver |publisher=EUobserver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101546/http://euobserver.com/| archivedate= 18 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or theParliament.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparliament.com/ |title=EU Politics News and Policy |publisher=TheParliament.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628095128/http://www.theparliament.com/| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.

As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and [[Weltanschauung]] of the groups are academics.

==Academics==
Academics analysing the groups include [[Simon Hix]] ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/ Amie Kreppel] [[University of Florida]], [[Abdul Noury]] ([[Free University of Brussels]]), [[Gérard Roland (economist)|Gérard Roland]], ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Gail McElroy]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]], Department of Political Science), [[Kenneth Benoit]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]] - Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IIIS (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/ |title=Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Friedrich Heinemann]], [[Philipp Mohl]], and [[Steffen Osterloh]] ([[University of Mannheim]] - Centre for European Economic Research&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zew.de/en/&lt;/ref&gt;).

The results for each group are shown in the adjacent diagram. The vertical scale is anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is economic left-right spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.

Two of the groups (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP subgroup ( {{legend2|#3399FF|}}) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( {{legend2|#0000FF|}}) were right-wing Eurosceptics.

IND/DEM was also split along its subgroups: the reformist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, bottom-center) voted as centrist Eurosceptics, and the secessionist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, middle-right) voted as right-wing Euroneutrals. The reformist subgroup was able to pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it's out of the Parliament's purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. This resulted in the secessionist subgroup being ''less'' eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.&lt;ref name="Times1845227"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece Leader of the UKIP accused of selling out, The Sunday Times, May 27, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032543/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EUL/NGL and G/EFA voted closely together, as did PES and ALDE, and EPP-ED and UEN. Surprisingly, given that PES and EPP-ED are partners in the Grand Coalition, they were not each other's closest allies, although they did vote with each other about two-thirds of the time. IND/DEM did not have close allies within the political groups, preferring instead to cooperate most closely with the [[Non-Inscrits]].

EUL/NGL and G/EFA were the most left-wing groups, UEN and EDD the most right-wing, and that was mirrored in their attitudes towards taxation, homosexual equality, abortion, euthanasia and controlling migration into the EU. The groups fell into two distinct camps regarding further development of EU authority, with UEN and EDD definitely against and the rest broadly in favor. Opinion was wider on the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], with only PES, ELDR and EPP-ED in favor and the others against. Unsurprisingly, G/EFA was far more in favor of Green issues compared to the other groups.

Party group switching in the European Parliament is the phenomenon where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party group to the other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up to a maximum of 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, A.M. and M.

A '''Bachelor of Fine Arts''' ('''BFA''', '''B.F.A.''') is the standard [[undergraduate]] [[Academic degree|degree]] for students in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] seeking a professional education in the [[visual arts|visual]] or [[performing arts]].

==Background==
In the United States, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical BFA program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general [[liberal arts]] studies. For a BA in Art, the ratio might be reversed.

The [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] (NASAD), which accredits Bachelor of Fine Arts programs in visual art and design in the United States, states that "the professional degree (BFA) focuses on intensive work in the visual arts supported by a program of general studies," whereas "the liberal arts degree (BA) focuses on art and design in the context of a broad program of general studies."

A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree will often require an area of specialty such as [[acting]], [[musical theatre]], [[game design]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[computer animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[dramatic writing]], [[drawing]], [[fiber]], [[film production]], [[visual effects]], [[animation]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[visual arts]],  [[Technical_director|technical arts]], [[interior design]], [[metalworking]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music|music]], [[new media]], [[painting]], [[photography]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[stage management]], or [[television production]]. Some schools instead give their students a broad education in many disciplines of the arts.

Although a Bachelor of Fine Arts is traditionally considered a four-year degree, a BFA program may take longer to complete because of the amount of studio course work required.

==Other countries==
In some countries such a degree is called a Bachelor of Creative Arts (BCA). In the [[United Kingdom]] the equivalent degree is the Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Fine Art. In [[Australia]] the Bachelor of Fine Arts is awarded to students completing a degree in visual and [[performing arts]]. Specific degrees such as the Bachelor of Dance or Bachelor of Drama are used by some performing arts institutions in Australia and much of [[Europe]]. In [[India]] a Fine Arts undergraduate degree is known as a BFA or BVA (Bachelor of Visual Arts). It is a four-year degree.

'''Biobus''' is a novel concept in [[science education]] involving a bus that has been equipped as a self-contained, [[mobile laboratory]] used to educate K-12 students in biology basics.&lt;ref name="Cardia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cardia|first1=Alexandra|title=Street Smarts: The BioBus Brings a Rolling Science Lab to Resource-Strapped Schools|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bio-bus-science-education/|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=6 February 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alec|title=The Magic School Bus Comes to Life|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/biobus-hopes-drive-students-science/|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[WNYC]]|date=5 November 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus may also be used for other audiences such as community organizations.

The first Biobus program was created in 1999 by [[Georgia State University]] (GSU), with grant assistance from the National Science Foundation. Since its founding, the GSU Biobus has made 950 visits involving over 80,000 people. The concept has spread beyond Georgia, including New York City.

Bukkake videos are a relatively prevalent niche in contemporary pornographic films. Originating in Japan in the 1980s, the genre subsequently spread to North America and Europe, and crossed over into [[gay pornography]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Bukkake udon tent.jpg|thumb|right|In Japanese, the word ''bukkake'' has extensive non-sexual use, such as this food tent advertising [[bukkake udon]] noodles.]]

Bukkake is the noun form of the Japanese verb ''bukkakeru'' (ぶっ掛ける, to dash or sprinkle water),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The%20(Almost)%20Complete%20Japanzine%20Dictionary%20of%20Japan%20Sex |title=The (Almost) Complete Japanzine Dictionary of Japan Sex |work=seekjapan.jp |accessdate=3 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202033818/http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The%2B%28Almost%29%2BComplete%2BJapanzine%2BDictionary%2Bof%2BJapan%2BSex |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and means "to dash", "splash", or "heavy splash".&lt;ref name=Routledge /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle201077"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Moore | first1 = Lisa Jean | last2 = Weissbein | first2 = Julianna | author-link1 = Lisa Jean Moore | contribution = Cocktail parties: fetishizing semen in pornography beyond bukkake | editor-last = Boyle | editor-first = Karen | editor-link = Karen Boyle | title = Everyday pornography | page = 77 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415543781 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8yznvRX-hfAC&amp;pg=PA77 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; The compound verb can be decomposed into a prefix and a verb: ''butsu'' (ぶつ) and ''kakeru'' (掛ける). ''Butsu'' is a prefix derived from the verb "buchi", which literally means to hit, but the usage of the prefix is a verb-intensifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ぶち【打ち】 |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E3%81%B6%E3%81%A1&amp;dtype=0&amp;stype=0&amp;dname=0na&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=18773916144900 |publisher=Shogakukan |accessdate=2010-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804061906/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8 |archivedate=4 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kakeru'' in this context means to shower or pour. The word ''bukkake'' is often used in Japanese to describe pouring out a liquid with sufficient momentum to cause splashing or spilling. Indeed, bukkake is used in Japan to describe a type of dish where hot broth is poured over noodles, as in [[Udon#Cold|bukkake udon]] and bukkake [[soba]].

==History==
Bukkake was first represented in [[pornographic films]] in the mid to late 1980s in Japan.&lt;ref name="Baker2004" /&gt; According to one commentator, a significant factor in the development of bukkake as a pornographic form was the [[Censorship in Japan#Pornography|mandatory censorship in Japan]] where genitals must be [[Pixelization|pixelated]] by a "mosaic".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; One consequence of this is that Japanese pornography tends to focus more on the face and body of actresses rather than on their genitals.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Since film producers could not show penetration, they sought other ways to depict sex acts without violating Japanese law and since semen did not need to be censored, a loophole existed for harder sex scenes.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; However, popularization of the act and the term for it has been credited to director [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/04/63009?currentPage=2 |title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts |accessdate=2009-07-01 |author=Xeni Jardin |date=4 December 2004 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese adult video studio [[Shuttle Japan]] registered the term "ぶっかけ/ＢＵＫＫＡＫＥ" as a trademark (No. 4545137) in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttle-japan.com/regi.html |title=Registered Trademark|publisher=shuttle-japan.com|accessdate=2010-07-09|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice then spread from Japan to the United States and then Europe in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake&gt;Pp. 31–37 ''My, My American Bukkake'' by Susannah Breslin in Greta Christina, Daniel Clowes, ''Best Erotic Comics 2008, illustrated edition'', Last Gasp, 2007. {{ISBN|0-86719-686-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sigel&gt;{{cite book|title=International exposure: perspectives on modern European pornography, 1800–2000|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|author=Lisa Z.

Hudson, Jeff; Doong, Nicholas. XVII World Congress of Sexology, Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male viewers' motivation==
[[Americans|American]] editor and publisher [[Russ Kick]], quoting a [[sexologist]], states that men enjoy a "sense of closure and finality about sex", something that watching other men ejaculate provides.&lt;ref name="Kick2005" /&gt; The viewer identifies with the ejaculating men, experiencing a sense of vicarious pleasure.&lt;ref name="Kick2005" /&gt; According to [[English–American]] [[anti-pornography]] campaigner [[Gail Dines]], the ejaculate on the female performer's body "also marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership; she quotes veteran American porn actor and producer [[William Margold|Bill Margold]] stating: "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt;

==Reception==
A number of authors have described bukkake as premised on humiliation. [[Forensic psychologist]] [[Karen Franklin]] has described bukkake as symbolic [[group rape]], characterising its primary purpose as the [[Sexual abuse|humiliation]], degradation and [[Sexual objectification|objectification of women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Feminist anti-pornography activist [[Gail Dines]] describes the [[money shot]] of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman, taken to a new extreme in bukkake through the involvement of multiple men, as "one of the most degrading acts in porn".&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Dines|title=Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZOjb8Sk1bUC&amp;pg=PR26|accessdate=18 February 2011|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-4452-0|page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tristan Taormino]], feminist author and sex educator, has likened bukkake to a "gay [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|circle jerk]]", noting the inconsistency between its billing as a heterosexual practice and the fact that it features a group of naked men standing in close proximity to each other, [[masturbating]] together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Taormino | first = Tristan | authorlink = Tristan Taormino | title = Eminem Is My Bitch | date = 13 March 2001 | work = [[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phillip Vannini]], [[associate professor]] in the School of Communication and Culture at [[Royal Roads University]], quotes "self-proclaimed net sex commentator" George Kranz, who views recent American interpretations of bukkake as a "significant advance in human behaviour", emphasising the lively, almost party-like atmosphere of American bukkake videos compared to the more subdued Japanese style.&lt;ref name="Waskul2004" /&gt;

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Climate ethics''' is an area of research that focuses on the ethical dimensions of climate change (also known as [[global warming]]), and concepts such as [[climate justice]].

Human-induced climate change raises many profound [[Ethics|ethical]] questions, yet many {{Who||date=February 2012}} believe that these ethical issues have not been addressed adequately in climate change policy debates or in the scientific and economic literature on climate change; and that, consequently, ethical questions are being overlooked or obscured in climate negotiations, policies and discussions . It has been pointed out that those most responsible for climate change are not the same people as those most vulnerable to its effects.

Terms such as [[climate justice]] and ecological justice ('eco justice') are used worldwide, and have been adopted by various organizations.

== Overview ==

An article in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (Patz, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Impact of regional climate change on human health|volume=438|pages=310–317|date=17 November 2005|doi=10.1038/nature04188|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04188.html|first1=Jonathan A|last1=Patz|first2=Diarmid|last2=Campbell-Lendrum|first3=Tracey|last3=Holloway|first4=Jonathan A|last4=Foley|bibcode=2005Natur.438..310P}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the human-induced warming that the world is now experiencing is already causing 150,000 deaths and 5 million incidents of disease each year from additional [[malaria]] and [[diarrhea]], mostly in the poorest nations.  Death and disease incidents are likely to soar as warming increases. Facts such as this demonstrate that climate change is compromising rights to life, liberty and personal security.  Hence, ethical analysis of climate change policy must examine how that policy  impacts on those basic rights.

Climate change raises a number of particularly challenging ethical issues about [[distributive justice]], in particular concerning how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems such as [[cost-benefit analysis]] usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution.

== ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' ==

In December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' was launched at the 10th Conference of Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].  The major outcome of this meeting was the Buenos Aires Declaration on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change.

===Objectives===
The program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change seeks to:
*Facilitate express examination of ethical dimensions of climate change particularly for those issues entailed by specific positions taken by governments, businesses, NGOs, organizations, or individuals on climate change policy matters;
*Create better understanding about the ethical dimensions of climate change among policy makers and the general public;
*Assure that people around the world, including those most vulnerable to climate change, participate in any ethical inquiry about responses to climate change;
*Develop an interdisciplinary approach to inquiry about the ethical dimensions of climate change and support publications that examine the ethical dimensions of climate change;
*Make the results of scholarship on the ethical dimensions of climate change available to and accessible to policy makers, scientists, and citizen groups;
*Integrate ethical analysis into the work of other institutions engaged in climate change policy including the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.

===Position===
Given the severity of impact to be expected and given the likelihood that some level of important disruptions in living conditions will occur for great numbers of people due to climate change events, this group contends that there is sufficient convergence among ethical principles to make a number of concrete recommendations on how governments should act, or identify ethical problems with positions taken by certain governments, organizations, or individuals.

Facts about climate change and fundamental human rights provide the starting point for climate ethics.

There are many definitions of co-production. One technical definition is that '''Co-production''' is where technical experts and other groups co-generate new knowledge and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Christenson. ''The Co-production of Archaeological Knowledge: The 	Essential Relationship of Amateurs and Professionals in 20th Century American Archaeology. Complutum (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) 24(2): 63-72, 2013 https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/view/43367&lt;/ref&gt; It is the dynamic interaction between [[technology and society]]. It has a long history, particularly arising out of radical theories of knowledge in the 1970s.

==Description==
Co-production forms part of [[Mode 2]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow ''The New Production of Knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies'' Sage. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. ''States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order''.  Routledge.  2004. {{ISBN|978-0-415-40329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbers, Hans. ''Inside the Politics of Technology: Agency and Normativity in the Co-Production of Technology and Society''.  Amsterdam University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used in the [[sociology of science]] to describe one of the modes, or ways that knowledge is formed. In [[Mode 2]], science and technology studies the move from extreme [[technological determinism]] and [[social constructivism]], to a more systemic understanding of how technology and society ‘co-produce’ each other. Co-production is functionally comparable to the concepts of [[causality loop]], [[positive feedback]], and [[co-evolution]] – all of which describe how two or more variables of a system affect and essentially create each other, albeit with respect to different variables operating at different scales. And as with these other concepts, if used too broadly/uncritically, co-production risks [[noetic flatness]] – if technology and society co-produce each other equally, the justification for maintaining the boundary between them dissolves (in which case [[actor-network theory]] may be invoked). Unless overlapping sets of [[boundary-work]] are employed, co-production may also fail to account for power differentials within each variable, (in this case, within technology and society).

From a more [[Science, technology and society|STS]] perspective, [[Sheila Jasanoff]], has written that "Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in." Co-production draws on constitutive (such as [[Actor–network theory]]) and interactional work ([[Leviathan and the Air-Pump|such as the Edinburgh School]]) in [[Science, technology and society|STS]].  As a sensitizing concept, the idiom of co-production looks at four themes: "the emergence and stabilization of new techno-scientific objects and framings, the resolution of scientific and technical controversies; the processes by which the products of techno-science are made intelligible and portable across boundaries; and the adjustment of science’s cultural practices in response to the contexts in which science is done."  Studies employing co-production often follow the following pathways: "making identities, making institutions, making discourses, and making representations"&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order. Routledge. 2004 http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If the individual recombination rates (between A and B; and between B and C) are known, then the c.o.c. between the regions AB and BC can be calculated from the rate of double recombination.]]

In genetics, the '''coefficient of coincidence (c.o.c.)''' is a measure of '''interference''' in the formation of [[chromosomal crossover]]s during [[meiosis]]. It is generally the case that, if there is a crossover at one spot on a chromosome, this decreases the likelihood of a crossover in a nearby spot.&lt;ref name="itga"&gt;[[Anthony J. F. Griffiths|Griffiths AJF]], [[Susan R. Wessler|Wessler SR]], [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin RC]], [[Sean B. Carroll|Carroll SB]] (2008) ''Introduction to Genetic Analysis''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; This is called interference.

The coefficient of coincidence is typically calculated from recombination rates between three genes. If there are three genes in the order A B C, then we can determine how closely [[genetic linkage|linked]] they are by frequency of recombination. Knowing the recombination rate between A and B and the recombination rate between B and C, we would naively expect the double recombination rate to be the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of these two rates.

The coefficient of coincidence is calculated by dividing the ''actual'' frequency of double recombinants by this expected frequency:&lt;ref name="itga" /&gt;

:'''c.o.c.''' = actual double recombinant frequency / expected double recombinant frequency

Interference is then defined as follows:&lt;ref name="itga" /&gt;

:'''interference''' = 1 − c.o.c.

This figure tells us how strongly a crossover in one of the DNA regions (AB or BC) interferes with the formation of a crossover in the other region.

==Worked example==

[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]] females of [[genotype]] ''a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;a b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c'' were crossed with males of genotype ''aa bb cc''. This led to 1000 progeny of the following [[phenotype]]s:

:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''244''' (parental genotype, shows no recombination)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c: '''81''' (recombinant between B and C)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;bc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''23''' (double recombinant)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;bc: '''152''' (recombinant between A and B)
:ab&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''148''' (recombinant between A and B)
:ab&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c: '''27''' (double recombinant)
:abc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''89''' (recombinant between B and C)
:abc: '''236''' (parental genotype, shows no recombination)

From these numbers it is clear that the b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/b [[locus (genetics)|locus]] lies between the a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/a locus and the c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/c locus.

There are 23 + 152 + 148 + 27 = 350 progeny showing recombination between genes A and B. And there are 81 + 23 + 27 + 89 = 220 progeny showing recombination between genes B and C. Thus the expected rate of double recombination is (350 / 1000) * (220 / 1000) = 0.077, or 77 per 1000.

However, there are actually only 23 + 27 = 50 double recombinants. The coefficient of coincidence is therefore 50 / 77 = 0.65.

Interference is 1 − 0.65 = 0.35.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4430">{{other uses|Concordance (disambiguation)}}

'''Concordance''', as used in [[genetics]], usually means the presence of the same [[Trait (biological)|trait]] in both members of a pair of [[twins]].  However, the strict definition is ''the probability that a pair of individuals will both have a certain characteristic, given that one of the pair has the characteristic.'' For example, twins are concordant when both have or both lack a given trait.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lewontin, ''Human Diversity''. (Scientific American Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal example of concordance is that of [[identical twins]].

==Twin studies==
A [[twin study]] compares the concordance rate of identical twins to that of fraternal twins. This can help suggest whether a disease or a certain trait has a genetic cause. Controversial uses of twin data have looked at concordance rates for [[homosexuality]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

Because identical twins are genetically virtually identical, it follows that a genetic pattern carried by one would very likely also be carried by the other. If a characteristic identified in one twin is caused by a certain gene, then it would also very likely be present in the other twin. Thus, the concordance rate of a given characteristic helps suggest whether or to what extent a characteristic  is related to genetics.

There are several problems with this assumption:
#A given genetic pattern may not have 100% [[penetrance]], in which case it may have different [[phenotype|phenotypic]] consequences in genetically identical individuals;
#Developmental and environmental conditions may be different for genetically identical individuals. If developmental and environmental conditions contribute to the development of the disease or other characteristic, there can be differences in the outcome of genetically identical individuals;
#The logic is further complicated if the characteristic is [[polygenic]], i.e., caused by differences in more than one gene.
#[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] effects can alter the genetic expressions in twins through varied factors. The expression of the epigenetic effect is typically weakest when the twins are young and increases as the identical twins grow older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Inherent-similarities-in-identical-twins-may-not-be-so-strong-3891-1/|title=Inherent similarities in identical twins may not be so strong ( Identical twins may be more different f...)|website=www.bio-medicine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Where in the absence of one or more environmental factors a condition will not develop in an individual, even with high concordance rates, the proximate cause is environmental, with strong genetic influence: thus "a substantial role of genetic factors does not preclude the possibility that the development of the disease can be modified by environmental intervention." So "genetic factors are assumed to contribute to the development of that disease", but cannot be assumed alone to be causal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/3/493|title=Increased Concordance of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Identical Twins|first1=Simon Francis|last1=Thomsen|first2=Lone Graff|last2=Stensballe|first3=Axel|last3=Skytthe|first4=Kirsten Ohm|last4=Kyvik|first5=Vibeke|last5=Backer|first6=Hans|last6=Bisgaard|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|issue=3|pages=493–496|via=pediatrics.aappublications.org|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1889|pmid=18310197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genotyping studies ==
In [[genotyping]] studies where DNA is directly assayed for positions of variance (see [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]), concordance is a measure of the percentage of [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] that are measured as identical.  Samples from the same individual or identical twins theoretically have a concordance of 100%, but due to assaying errors and [[somatic mutation]]s, they are usually found in the range of 99% to 99.95%.  Concordance can therefore be used as a method of assessing the accuracy of a [[genotyping]] [[assay]] platform.

Because a child inherits half of his or her [[DNA]] from each parent, parents and children, siblings, and [[fraternal twins|fraternal]] (dizygotic) twins have a concordance that averages 50% using this measure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13604">'''Creative writing''' is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal [[professional writing|professional]], [[journalistic]], [[Academic writing|academic]], or [[technical writing|technical]] forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] or with various traditions of [[poetry]] and [[poetics]]. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as [[feature story|feature stories]] to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both [[fiction]]al and [[non-fiction]]al works fall into this category, including such forms as [[novel]]s, [[biography|biographies]], [[short stories]], and [[poem]]s. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and [[poetry]] classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as [[crime fiction|crime]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]]. Writing for the screen and stage&amp;mdash;[[screenwriting]] and [[playwrighting]]&amp;mdash;are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.

Creative writing can technically be considered any writing of [[Originality|original]] [[Composition (language)|composition]]. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called [[literature]], including the variety of its [[Literary genre|genre]]s. In her work, ''Foundations of Creativity'', Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant’s ''Teaching the People's Language'' to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:

{{cquote|Witty and LaBrant…[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as
#the need for keeping records of significant experience,
#the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and
#the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.&lt;ref name="Marksberry"&gt;Marksberry, Mary Lee. ''Foundation of Creativity.'' Harper's Series on Teaching. (New York ; London: Harper &amp; Row, 1963), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In academia==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010|talk=y}}
Unlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the [[language]], creative writing is believed to focus on students’ self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Burges and [[Syracuse University]]. "Creative Writing", 3.&lt;/ref&gt; While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages, if not throughout, [[K–12 education]], perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in [[university|universities]]. Following a reworking of university education in the [[post-war]] era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts degree]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1970 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|title=Creative Writing - UEA|author=|date=|website=www.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2014-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522210914/http://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|archive-date=2014-05-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the novelists [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angus Wilson]]. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:
{{cquote|For the first time in the sad and enchanting history of literature, for the first time in the glorious and dreadful history of the world, the writer was welcome in the academic place. If the mind could be honored there, why not the imagination?&lt;ref name="Engle"&gt;Engle, Paul. "The Writer and the Place." In ''A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop,'' edited by Robert Dana, 2(Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Programs of study===
Creative Writing programs are typically available to writers from the high school level all the way through graduate school/university and adult education. Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent time as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Most Creative Writing degrees for undergraduates in college are [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degrees (BFA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some continue to pursue a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Creative Writing, the terminal degree in the field. At one time rare, [[PhD.]] programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.

Creative writers typically decide an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and they usually start with short stories or simple poems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of [[film]] and [[theatre]], [[screenwriting]] and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs, as creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.

== In the classroom ==
Creative writing is usually taught in a [[workshop]] format rather than [[seminar]] style. In workshops students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as [[editing]], [[Narrative structure|structural]] [[literary technique|techniques]], [[genre]]s, random [[plot generator|idea generating]] or unblocking [[writer's block]] . Some noted [[author]]s, such as [[Michael Chabon]], [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], [[Kevin Brockmeier]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Karl Kirchwey]],&lt;ref name=twsOctBeqqq&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Tremain]] and reputed screenwriters, such as [[David Benioff]], [[Darren Star]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], have graduated from university creative writing programs.

===Controversy in academia===
Creative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the USA) to be an extension of the [[English studies|English]] discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the USA and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.
{{cquote|To say that the creative has no part in education is to argue that a university is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Paul. "The Writer and the Place," 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Those who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students’ abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer’s own work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary study outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to be experience in creative [[problem solving]].

Despite the large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught.  [[Louis Menand]] explores the issue in an article for the New Yorker in which he quotes [[Kay Boyle]], the director of creative writing program at San Francisco State for sixteen years, who said, “all creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.” &lt;ref&gt;"Show or Tell - Should Creative Writing be Taught?" by Louis Menand - The New Yorker, June 8, 2009, [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand Newyorker.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830182154/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand |date=2009-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs' lack of both diversity and genre awareness.

They can also be used in high voltage electric power transmission grids for a similar purpose. In the control of electric motors, current limiting reactors can be used to restrict starting current or as part of a speed control system.

Current limiting reactors, once called current limiting [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] coils, were first presented in 1915.&lt;ref name="Source 4"&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Use of Current-Limiting Reactors |first1=Walter Melville |last1=Dann |first2=H. H. |last2=Rudd |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu55816380;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=5;num=1 |conference=Meeting of the Society of Mechanical, Electrical, and Steam Engineers |location=Boody House, [[Toledo, Ohio]] |date=June 17–18, 1915 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inventor of the current limiting reactance coil was Vern E. Alden who filed the patent on November 20, 1917 with an issue date of September 11, 1923. The original assignee was [[Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Alden |inventor-first=Vern |country=US |number=1467771 |title=Current Limiting Reactance Coil |assign=Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company |gdate=September 11, 1923 |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1467771 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
A current limiting reactor is used when the [[prospective short-circuit current]] in a distribution or transmission system is calculated to exceed the [[interrupting rating]] of the associated [[switchgear]].  The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear. 
The amount of protection that a current limiting reactor offers depends upon the percentage increase in impedance that it provides for the system.&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Limiting Reactors: Technical Overview and Measurement Procedures|url=http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|publisher=NWL|accessdate=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303231851/http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Current Limiting Reactor.jpg|thumb|Current Limiting Reactor]]

The main motive of using current limiting reactors is to reduce short-circuit currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used. They can also be used to protect other system components from high current levels and to limit the inrush current when starting a large motor.&lt;ref name="Source 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Power|url=http://www.qualitypower.co.in/current-reactors.php|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
It is desirable that the reactor does not go into magnetic saturation during a short-circuit, so generally an air-core [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is used. At low and medium voltages, air-insulated coils are practical; for high transmission voltages, the coils may be immersed in [[transformer oil]]. 
Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.&lt;ref&gt;"Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book", Westinghouse Electr Corporation, Pittsburgh PA , 1950 pp. 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Line reactor==
A '''line reactor''' is an inductor wired between a power source and a load.  In addition to the current limiting function, the device serves to filter out spikes of current &lt;ref&gt;http://www.myronzucker.com/linereactorpg1.html What is a Line Reactor?&lt;/ref&gt;  and may also reduce injection of harmonic currents into the power supply.  The most common type is designed for [[three-phase electric power]], in which three isolated inductors are each wired in series with one of the three line phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228061844/http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |archivedate=2012-12-28 |df= }} Line reactor configurations&lt;/ref&gt; Line reactors are generally installed in motor driven equipment to limit starting current, and may be used to protect [[Variable-frequency drive]]s and motors.:&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_line_reactors_vfds/&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Eco-investing''' or '''green investing''', is a form of [[socially responsible investing]] where investments are made in companies that support or provide [[environmentally friendly]] products and practices. These companies encourage (and often profit from) new technologies that support the transition from carbon dependence to more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henshaw |first=Mark |title=Eco Investor Guide |publisher=Eco Investor Guide, Inc. |year=2010 |url=http://www.ecoinvestorguide.com/wp-content/uploads/EcoInvestorGuide.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industries' environmental impacts become more apparent, green topics have not only taken center stage in pop culture, but the financial world as well. In the 1990s many investors “began to look for those companies that were better than their competitors in terms of managing their environmental impact.” While some investors still focus their funds to avoid only “the most egregious polluters,” the emphasis for many investors has switched to changing “the way money is used,” and using “it in a positive, transformative way to get us from where we are now ultimately to a truly sustainable society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keane |first=Robert F. |title=The Green Advisor: SRI &amp; Green Investing Grow Up |publisher=Investment Advisor |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.advisorone.com/2009/11/01/the-green-advisor-sri-green-investing-grow-up |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard – launched by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance to monitor private investments in green companies – estimated that over $1.248 trillion has been invested in solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/hydro and other green sectors since 2007. This number represents investments from [[North America]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]], as well at other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard Finds Over $1 Trillion Invested in Green Since 2007 |publisher=Green Money Journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.greenmoneyjournal.com/article.mpl?newsletterid=51&amp;articleid=749 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco/Green Investing versus Socially Responsible Investing==
While many eco-investments may be considered socially responsible investments, and vice versa, the two are not mutually inclusive. [[Socially responsible investing]] is the practice of investing only in those companies which satisfy certain moral or ethical criteria. This may include companies with an interest in the environment, but also supports various other social and religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Socially Responsible Investing |publisher=Investor Glossary |url=http://www.investorglossary.com/socially-responsible-investing.htm |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-investing narrows in on the interests of sustainable environmental issues. Specifically, eco-investments focus on companies who work on renewable energy and clean technologies.

==Eco-investing sectors==
There are several sectors that fall under the eco-investing umbrella. [[Renewable energy]] refers to both solar, wind, tidal current,wave and conventional hydro technology. This includes companies that build [[solar panel]]s or [[wind turbine]]s, or the raw materials and services that contribute to these technologies&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt; It also refers to Energy Storage – companies that develop and use technologies to store large amounts of energy, particularly renewable energies. A good example of this is the fuel cells used in [[hybrid car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Technology &amp; Alternative Fuels |publisher=Demand Media, Inc. |url=http://www.greencar.com/alternative-fuels-green-technology.php |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under the renewable energy sector are Biofuels. This group includes companies that use or supply biological resources (like algae, corn or waster wood) to create energy or fuel. Other technologies that are included in the renewable energy group are: Geothermal (companies who use or convert heat to electric energy) and Hydroelectricity (companies who harness water energy to make electricity).&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Buildings and Efficiency sector refers to companies that manufacture green building materials or energy-efficient services in the world of engineering and architecture. Green building materials include energy-efficient glass, insulation, and lighting among others. Recycling companies and energy conservation companies also fall under this sector.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Eco Living sector refers to companies that offer sustainable goods and services for healthy living. This includes organic farming, green pesticides, health care and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

Green investment has significantly grown in the UK and there are now 136 funds listed on the [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library Worldwise Investor fund library] under the themes: Agriculture, Carbon, Clean Energy, Forestry, Environmental, Multi-thematic and Water. All of these funds account for around [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/knowledge/reports?fd=%2527%2582%25F9%25B8%257F%25C5%2500%25BB%25E3%25B61sXm%25F1%259E%2584%252FK%2591%250E-%25F2%25B1x0L%25DFW%25B9%25C2Z%250Bf%2589%2501%25CCY%25C1%25D1%259A%2594%25E7%25C92s%25C5 £21.8bn] in the UK.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W. S. | year = 1988 | title = Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohistory | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2k09f06d| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 35 | issue = 1| page = 10 | doi=10.2307/482430| jstor = 482430 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''File integrity monitoring (FIM)''' is an [[internal control]] or [[process (computing)|process]] that performs the act of validating the [[integrity]] of [[operating system]] and [[application software]] [[Computer file|files]] using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good [[baseline (configuration management)|baseline]].  This comparison method often involves calculating a known cryptographic [[checksum]] of the file's original baseline and comparing with the calculated checksum of the current state of the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ionx.co.uk/products/verisys/how-it-works |title=  Verisys - How it Works |publisher= Ionx|accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other file attributes can also be used to monitor integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncircle.com/index.php?s=products_ccm_file-integrity-monitoring|title=File Integrity Monitoring|publisher=nCircle|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the act of performing file integrity monitoring is automated using internal controls such as an application or [[process (computing)|process]]. Such monitoring can be performed [[Randomness|randomly]], at a defined [[polling (computer science)|polling]] interval, or in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].

==Security objectives==
Changes to configurations, files and file attributes across the IT infrastructure are common, but hidden within a large volume of daily changes can be the few that impact file or configuration integrity. These changes can also reduce security posture and in some cases may be leading indicators of a breach in progress. Values monitored for unexpected changes to files or configuration items include: 
* Credentials
* Privileges and Security Settings
* Content
* Core attributes and size
* Hash values
* Configuration values

==Compliance objectives==
Multiple [[Regulatory compliance|compliance objectives]] indicate file integrity monitoring as a [[requirement]].  Several examples of compliance objectives with the requirement for file integrity monitoring include:
* [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI-DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (Requirement 11.5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pa-dss_v2.pdf|title=Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|publisher=PCI Security Council |accessdate= 2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hogging''' or '''sweat hogging''' refers to the practice of groups of men who target [[overweight]] or [[obese]] women, typically for sexual encounters. Unlike [[fat fetishism|fat fetishists]], men who participate in hogging are not necessarily sexually attracted to obese women's bodies; they aim to take advantage of a female's [[stereotype|stereotypical]] low [[self-esteem]] or to derive amusement for themselves and their friends by engaging in sexual activities with women who are overweight.

== Practice ==
The social practice can be undertaken as an individual or group activity, and often includes excessive [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol consumption]], [[emotional detachment]], and degradation of the woman. Hogging does not always include [[sexual intercourse]], and often other sexual activities are the end goal. Participation sometimes includes making bets among male peers, as well as humiliating the woman involved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

She commented that the fat [[Social stigma|stigma]] is so extreme that even men who are genuinely attracted to overweight women cannot admit or discuss their feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice has also been suggested as a manifestation of [[hypermasculinity]], in which men who do not fit into normative expectations of manhood exhibit insecurity, defensiveness, and sexual aggression to make up for their incapacity to meet masculine standards. In this manner, hogging is described as a form of [[sexual predation]] in which sex is an act of conquest, not intimacy.&lt;ref name="McShaneWilliams2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">In the [[Petroleum industry]], '''Integrated operations''' (IO) refers to the integration of people, disciplines, organizations, work processes and [[information and communication technology]] to make smarter decisions. In short, IO is collaboration with focus on production.

==Contents of the term==
The most striking part of IO has been the use of always-on videoconference rooms between offshore platforms and land-based offices. This includes broadband connections for sharing of data and video-surveillance of the platform. This has made it possible to move some personnel onshore and use the existing human resources more efficiently. Instead of having e.g. an expert in geology on duty at every platform, the expert may be stationed on land and be available for consultation for several offshore platforms. 
It's also possible for a team at an office in a different time zone to be consulting the night-shift of the platform, so that no land-based workers need work at night.

Splitting the team between land and sea demands new work processes, which together with ICT is the two main focus points for IO. Tools like videoconferencing and 3D-visualization also creates an opportunity for new, more cross-discipline cooperations. For instance, a shared 3D-visualization may be tailored to each member of the group, so that the geologist gets a visualization of the geological structures while the drilling engineer focuses on visualizing the well. Here, real-time measurements from the well are important but the downhole bandwidth has previously been very restricted. Improvements in bandwidth, better measurement devices, better aggregation and visualization of this information and improved models that simulate the rock formations and wellbore currently all feed on each other. An important task where all these improvements play together is real-time production optimization.

In the process industry in general, the term is used to describe the increased cooperation, independent of location, between operators, maintenance personnel, electricians, production management as well as business management and suppliers to provide a more streamlined plant operation.

By deploying IO, the petroleum industry draws on lessons from the process industry. This can be seen in a larger focus on the whole production chain and management ideas imported from the production and process industry. A prominent idea in this regard is real-time [[Process optimization|optimization]] of the whole value chain, from long term management of the [[oil reservoir]], through capacity allocations in pipe networks and calculations of the net present value of the produced oil. Reviews of the application of Integrated Operations can be found in papers presented in the by-annual society of petroleum engineers Intelligent Energy conferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|title = The Art of Intelligent Energy(iE) - Insights and Lessons Learned from the application of iE|date = 2010|accessdate = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|website = |publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus on the whole production chain is also seen in debates about how to organize people in an IO organisation, with frequent calls for breaking down the [[Information silo]]s in the oil companies. A large oil company is typically organized in [[functional silo]]s corresponding to disciplines such as [[Oil drilling#Drilling|drilling]], [[Oil drilling#Production|production]] and [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] management. This is regarded as inefficient by the IO movement, pointing out that the activities in any well or field by any of the silos will involve or affect all of the others. 
While some companies focus on their inhouse management structure, others also emphasize the integration and coordination of outside suppliers and collaborators in offshore-operations. For instance, it is pointed out that the oil and gas industry is lagging behind other industries in terms of [[Operational intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Brulé - Digital Energy Journal sep09 p22 www.digitalenergyjournal.com/issues/DEJ20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas and theories that IO management and work processes build on will be familiar from [[operations research]], [[knowledge management]] and [[continual improvement]] as well as [[information systems]] and [[business transformation]]. This is perhaps most evident in the repeated referral to "people, process and technology"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integrated-operations.co.uk/ "Integrated Operations is about ensuring people, processes and technology work much more efficiently together"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/page.cfm/Link=65/t=m/goSection=16 "the 3 inter-related categories of:
People, process and organisational change; Technology and data; Case studies"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchoilandgas.com/distance-nothing-operation-everything-a143-1.html "The Third Efficiency Leap – Focus on People, Process and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; in IO discussions
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalio.com/what-is-io/ "Achieving a high performing IO program requires four fundamental building blocks:Transformational Leadership, Right People, Business Processes and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt;. As bullet-points this mirror many of the aforementioned fields.

Since 2010 major mining companies have become implementers of Integrated Operations, most notable Rio Tinto, BHP Biliton and Codelco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176814-MS|title = Integrated Operations (IO) in Mining and Oil and Gas, What can we learn from each other?|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = OnePetro|publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Incentives==
Common to most companies is that IO leads to cost savings as fewer people are stationed offshore and an increased efficiency. Lower costs, more efficient reservoir management and fewer mistakes during well drilling will in turn raise profits and make more oil fields economically viable. IO comes at a time when the oil industry is faced with more "brown fields", also referred to as "tail production", where the cost of extracting the oil will be higher than its market value, unless major improvements in technology and work processes are made.
It has been estimated that deployment of IO could produce 300 billion NOK of added value to the Norwegian continental shelf alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tu.no/olje-gass/article138103.ece&lt;/ref&gt; On a longer time-scale, working onshore control and monitoring of the oil production may become a necessity as new fields at deeper waters are based purely on unmanned sub-sea facilities.

Moving jobs onshore has also been touted as a way to keep and make better use of an [[Aging U.S. Workforce|aging workforce]], which is regarded as a challenge by western oil and gas companies. As the average age of the industry workforce is increasing with many nearing retirement, IO is being leveraged for knowledge sharing and training of younger workforce. More comfortable onshore jobs together with "high-tech" tools has also been fronted as a way to recruit young workers into an industry that is seen as "unsexy", "lowtech" and difficult to combine with a normal family life.

==Critique==
The security aspect of reducing the offshore workforce has been raised. Will on-site experience be lost and can familiarity with the platform and its processes be attained from an onshore office? The new working environment in any case demands changes to HSE routines. Some of the challenges also include clear role and responsibility definitions and clarifications between the onshore &amp; offshore personnel. Who in a given situation has the authority to take decisions, the onsite or the offshore staff. The increased integration of the offshore facilities with the onshore office environment and outside collaborators also expose work-critical ICT-infrastructure to the internet and the hazards of everyday ICT. 
As for the efficiency aspect, some criticize the onshore-offshore collaboration for creating a more bureaucratic working environment.

==Naming conventions==
Both the exact terms and the content used to describe IO vary between companies. The oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] has traditionally branded the term '''Smart Fields''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/home/content/innovation/meeting_demand/getting_more/smartfields/smartfields.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was an extension of '''Smart Wells''' that only referred to remote-controlled well-valves. [[BP]] uses '''Field of the future'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9025118&amp;contentId=7047802&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/bp-and-technology/more-recovery/real-time-data-and-decisions/field-of-the-future.html&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to its innovations in oil production. Chevron has '''i-field''', Honeywell has [http://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/explore/solutions/industry-solutions/oil-and-gas/off-shore-production/Pages/digital-suites-oil-gas.aspx '''Digital Suites for Oil and Gas'''] (a set of software and services), and [[Schlumberger]] terms it '''Digital Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slb.com/content/news/inside/2009/20090507_digital_energy.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term, understood as referring to oil and gas, is adopted in the title of the [[digital energy journal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalenergyjournal.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This term could have several meanings, as [[GE Enterprise Solutions|GE Digital Energy]] for instance, do not appear to use it in the IO sense.

Other terms include '''e-Field''', '''i-Field''', '''Digital Oilfield''', '''Intelligent Oilfield''', '''Field of the future''' and '''Intelligent Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epmag.com/archives/everyMonth/6264.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated operations has been the preferred term by [[Statoil]], the [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]] (OLF), a professional body and employer's association for oil and supplier companies&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the editor, Digital Energy Journal April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825175106/http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vendors such as [[ABB Group|ABB]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abb.no/industries/us/9AAC167609.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; IO is also the preferred term for Petrobras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/integrated-operations-petrobras/68719&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent Energy is the dominant term in publications revolving around the biannual SPE Intelligent Energy conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which has been one of the major conferences for the IO movement, along with the annual IO Science and Practice conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioconf.no/2010/doku.php&lt;/ref&gt; which obviously supports the IO term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6742">'''Klavarskribo''' (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a [[music notation]] system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable.

==History==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Cornelis Pot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klavarskribo.eu/en/history|title=History - Klavarskribo|website=www.klavarskribo.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; came from a family of shipbuilders and was managing director of Smit Slikkerveer, a factory which made [[dynamo]]s for ships. He had also a passion for music and wanted to others to be able to enjoy music by playing and by singing. He studied alternative music notations and from them developed his idea of Klavarskribo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jupp|first=Bridgette|date=2014|title=Klavarskribo Music Notation: Prospectus|url=http://www.klavarskribo.com/freemusic/Introduction%20to%20Klavarskribo_2014.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expected the music world to embrace his invention but was disappointed when that proved not to be the case. Having the financial means, Pot was able by himself to start and publish written courses and have music transcribed.

In the 1930s the number of klavar users grew enormously and much sheet music was transcribed and published in the klavar notation. During [[World War II]] these activities stopped, but afterwards Pot started with a new élan. His Klavarskribo Institute expanded so much as to employ fifty people at one time. Courses in English, French and German were offered.

The Klavarskribo Foundation was established after Pot’s death in 1977 in [[Ridderkerk]] (near [[Rotterdam]]) with limited financial means. The foundation is concerned with transcribing and publishing music mainly for church [[organist]]s, an important supportive group. Also written courses for a number of instruments, including guitar, accordion, recorder and in particular piano, and other keyboard instruments, are available. There are more than 10,000 klavar notation users in the Netherlands and abroad.

==Notation==
[[Image:KlavarExplain 1-E.png|200px|thumb|A keyboard with the stave growing out of it]]
[[Image:KlavarExplain 2-Erev1.png|200px|thumb|A melody with the note stems pointing to the right, indicating that the right hand should be used]]
[[Image:KlavarExplain 3-E.png|200px|thumb|A measure in three-time with bar lines and count lines]]

The klavar notation distinguishes itself from conventional notation in several ways.

The stave on which the notes are written is vertical so the music is read from top to bottom. Each note has its own individual position, low notes on the left and high notes on the right as on the piano. This stave consists of groups of two and three vertical lines corresponding to the black keys (notes) of the piano. White notes are written in the seven white spaces between the lines. Therefore sharps and flats are no longer needed, as each note has its own place in the octave. The evident correspondence between the stave and a piano induced Pot to use the name Klavarskribo. Though the klavar notation is a universal notation that can be used for all instruments and for singing, its greatest advantage is for instruments where a number of notes have to be played simultaneously: the keyboard instruments.

Duration and rhythm are shown graphically. A piece of music is divided into bars of equal length, which are subdivided into “counts” or beats. Short horizontal bar lines show the division between the bars, dotted lines indicate the counts. All notes are provided with stems—stems to the right: play with the right hand, stems to the left: left hand. These are placed so as to indicate in the measuring system exactly when a note must be played or sung. A note always lasts till the next one of the same hand or part appears, unless a stop sign or continuation dot is used. Therefore there is no connection between shape or colour of a note and its duration. The various kinds of 'rest' signs, different note heads, ties and different clefs are thus rendered unnecessary.

The klavar notation uses one clef: the centre of the keyboard is indicated by dotted lines representing C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|sharp}}, so Middle C can easily be located. There are no different clefs for the left and right hand.

This design enables the player to see clearly, after a short explanation, how the notation 'works', so that a beginner can start playing almost immediately. The player can see exactly which note or chord to play and which hand to use.

Klavar is not only for beginners; even difficult pieces by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] are available in the klavar notation. The Klavarskribo Foundation has transcribed more than 25,000 pieces and provides catalogues for the piano, reed organ, accordion, orchestra, electronic organ, keyboard and guitar. In addition to transcription, the PC software KlavarScript enables music in the traditional notation to be transcribed to the klavar notation through [[MIDI]] files, scanning, or playing through a [[MIDI keyboard]].

==Organizations==
In the [[Netherlands]] the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Klavar Vereniging Nederland (Dutch Klavar Union) are the two main organizations. The latter, active since 1978, has 800 members and its objective is, in cooperation with the Foundation, to promote and preserve the klavar notation. The Union keeps a register of teachers in the Netherlands who are willing to teach the klavar system. It tries to stimulate klavar users to take lessons from these teachers in order to improve their level of playing.

Both the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Dutch Klavar Union consider it their task to point out to those who wish to make music, or who are starting to do so, the advantages of using the klavar notation.

In the [[UK]], the Klavar Music Foundation of Great Britain promotes the use of klavar notation and has been in operation since 1976 as an Educational Trust and a Charity registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]], number 272510.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Macrosociology''' is an approach to [[sociology]] which emphasizes the analysis of [[social system]]s and [[population]]s on a large scale, at the level of [[social structure]], and often at a necessarily high level of theoretical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun(ed) ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'' (Article: Macrosociology), Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsociology]], by contrast, focuses on the individual social [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. Macrosociology also concerns individuals, families, and other constituent aspects of a society, but always does so in relation to larger social system of which they are a part. Macrosociology can also be the analysis of large collectivities (e.g. the [[city]], the [[christian Church|church]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Scott &amp; Gordon Marshall (eds) ''Dictionary of Sociology'', Oxford University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[population]]s are considered a society to the degree that is politically autonomous and its members to engage in a broad range of cooperative activities.{{Clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref name="lenski1982"&gt;[[Gerhard Lenski]], ''Human societies: An introduction to Macrosociology'', McGraw-Hill, 1982, {{ISBN|0-07-037176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this definition would apply to the population of [[Germany]] being deemed a society, but [[German language|German]]-speaking people as a whole scattered about different countries would not be considered a society.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt; Macrosociology deals with broad societal trends that can later be applied to the smaller features of a society. To differentiate, macrosociology deals with issues such as [[war]], distress of [[Third World]] nations, [[poverty]], and environmental deprivation, whereas microsociology analyses issues such as the role of [[women]], the nature of the [[family]], and [[immigration]].&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

==Theoretical strategies==

There are a number of theoretical strategies within contemporary macrosociology, but four of them stand out as major ones:

* The Idealist Strategy attempts to explain the basic features of social life by reference to the creative capacity of the human mind. "Idealists believe that human uniqueness lies in the fact that humans attach symbolic meanings to their actions"&lt;ref name="sanderson1988"&gt;Sanderson, Stephen K. ''Macrosociology: An Introduction to Human Societies'', Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Materialist Strategy attempts to explain the basic features of human social life in terms of the practical, material conditions of their existence.  These conditions include things like the nature of the physical environment, the level of technology, and the organization of the economic system.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;
* Functionalism, or [[structural functionalism]], is defined by many principles.  Functionalism essentially states that societies are complex systems of interrelated and interdependent parts, and each part of a society significantly influences the others.  Also, each part of society exists because it has a specific function to perform in contributing to the society as a whole. Finally, it states that societies tend toward a state of equilibrium or homeostasis, and if there is a disturbance in any part of the society then the other parts will adjust to restore the stability of the society as a whole.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;
* The [[Conflict Theory]], also called the Conflict Theoretical Strategy, rejects the idea that societies tend toward some basic consensus of harmony in which the features of society work for everyone's good.  It is based on the idea that the basic structure of society is determined by individuals and groups acquiring scarce resources to satisfy their own needs and wants, thus creating endless conflicts.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

== Historical macrosociology ==

As [[globalization]] has affected the world, it has also affected historical macrosociology, leading to the development of two different branches. One is based mainly in comparative and historical sociology (CHS), and the other in political economy of the world-systems (PEWS). CHS bases its analysis on states, and searches for "generalizations about common properties and principles of variation among instances across time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Arrighi, Giovanni. Globalization and historical macrosociology. (2000).''Sociology for the twenty-first century.'' 117-133.&lt;/ref&gt; PEWS, on the other hand, uses systems of states for analysis, and searches for "generalizations about interdependencies among a system's components and of principles of variation among systemic conditions across time and space."&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt; Despite the two schools' differences, both use historical knowledge to try and solve some of the problems seen in the field of macrosociology. As of recently, it has been argued that globalization poses a threat to the CHS way of thinking because it often leads to the dissolution of distinct states.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

Historical Macrosociologists:&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

[[Charles Tilly]]- CHS scholar- analysis based on national states

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]]- developed world systems theory- analysis based on world capitalist system

== The future of macrosociology: micro-macro links ==
Perhaps the most highly developed integrative effort to link microsociological and macrosociological phenomena is found in [[Anthony Giddens]]'s [[theory of structuration]], in which "social structure is defined as both constraining and enabling of human activity as well as both internal and external to the actor."&lt;ref name="borgatta1992"&gt;Borgatta, Edgar F. ''Encyclopedia of Sociology: Volume 3'', Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts to link micro and macro phenomena are evident in a growing body of empirical research.  Such work appears to follow Giddens' view of the constraining and enabling nature of social structure for human activity and the need to link structure and action.  "It appears safe to say that while macrosociology will always remain a central component of sociological theory and research, increasing effort will be devoted to creating workable models that link it with its microcounterpart."&lt;ref name="borgatta1992" /&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Message design logic''' is a [[communication theory]] that makes the claim that individuals possess implicit theories of communication within themselves, called message design logics.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, A. P., Rose, L. M., Edwards, C., &amp; Singer, L. M. (2008). An Investigation of the Relationships among Implicit Personal Theories of Communication, Social Support and Loneliness. Human Communication, 11(4), 445-461.
&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as a “theory of theories,” Message Design Logic offers three different fundamental premises in reasoning about [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, J. (2002). Cultural Assumptions Underlying Message Design Logic: Premises of Development, Preference, and Understanding. Intercultural Communication Studies, XI(4), 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; As author Barbara O’Keefe describes, Message Design Logic is “the kind of communication-constituting belief system the message producer relies on in reasoning from the goals sought to the message design used.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988"&gt;O'Keefe, B. J. (1988). The Logic of Message Design: Individual Differences in Reasoning about Communication. Communication Monographs, 55(1), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These three premises — Expressive Logic, Conventional Logic, and Rhetorical Logic — are [[belief systems]] that communicators might utilize when designing [[messages]]. The message design logics, therefore, represent “internally consistent and developmentally ordered stages in the acquisition of working knowledge about the systematic properties of verbal messages.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As O’Keefe describes further, each premise is “associated with a constellation of related beliefs: a communication-constituting concept, a conception of the functional possibilities of communication, unit formation procedures, and principles of coherence.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; The underlying idea behind O’Keefe’s work is that “communication is not necessarily a uniform process.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Components ==
The three components of Message Design Logic are based on "individuals’ levels of cognitive complexity," and are expressed in messages that vary in organization, content, and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Whether these components represent different levels of communication effectiveness is labeled as debatable by other communication scholars.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, L., &amp; Albrecht, T. L. (1996). Message design logic, social support, and mixed-status relationships. Western Journal of Communication, 60(4), 291-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expressive design logic ===
Seen as the simplest form of message production, the fundamental premise of Expressive Design Logic is that  “Language is a [[Media (communication)|medium]] for expressing thoughts and feelings.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; This premise is the simplest of the three logics and explains that someone says what they feel. As long as this feeling is conveyed in the message, the message is deemed successful. O’Keefe gives two reasons why individuals who operate under this design logic are very literal when it comes to impression in message design and interpretation. “First, they fail to appreciate that in communication, the process of [[expression (language)|expression]] can be made to serve other goals, and second, they interpret messages as independent units rather than as threads in an interaction fabric.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Individuals that communicate expressively do not recognize the idea that messages might be designed to induce particular reactions by the receiver. They believe that messages are taken straightforwardly by a receiver who has thoughts, feelings, or reactions that are to be communicated back to the sender. Through this idea there are only two possible relationships that can be held between the speaker's intentions and messages; 1) To fully and honestly express the speaker’s current mental state. 2) To convey a distorted version of the speaker’s mental state though editing or lying. Due to the extreme straightforwardness of expressive messages they may contain multiple facets that can be viewed as negative when discussing communicative effectiveness, such as pointless content (excessive knowledge of what the speaker feels or wants), [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancies]] (due to a thought being recycled), noncontingent threats or [[insults]] (simple announcements of punishments), or inoffensive but inappropriate comments (complimentary personal remarks inappropriately delivered).&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Ultimately, individuals using Expressive Design Logic believe that the element that unites a speaker’s messages is simply what is on the speaker’s mind, whether they are items of information from one encounter or items from a complex chain of associations.

=== Conventional design logic ===
The fundamental premise of Conventional Design Logic is that “communication is a game played cooperatively, according to socially conventional rules and procedures.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the expressive design logic, the communicator using conventional design logic distinguishes between thought and expression.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; In this design logic, language is viewed as [[Instrumental value|means]] of expressing propositions that are “specified by the social effect one wants to achieve.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991"&gt;O’Keefe, B. J. (1991). Message design logic and the management of multiple goals. In K.
Tracy (Ed.), Understanding face-to-face interaction: Issues linking goals and
discourse (pp. 101-117). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice conventional design logic consider various contexts as having fixed parameters and therefore design messages based upon what is most appropriate to the context.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; This message designing is done under the format of [[cooperation]] between the speaker and hearer. Using this logic is particularly valuable to achieve particular goals. Communication then is the means by which the goals are achieved. For example, someone constructing a conventional message would relate the message most to the context (the particular situation at hand) in order to achieve certain goals.

=== Rhetorical design logic ===
Seen as the most elaborate way of constructing messages, the fundamental premise of Rhetorical Design Logic is that “communication is the creation and negotiation of social selves and situations.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; For communicators using this logic, messages are designed to portray what the speaker wants reality to reflect.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; Under this belief system, O’Keefe explains that “all meaning is treated as a matter of dramaturgical enactment and social negotiation.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the conventional design logic, which says to design messages relevant to the given context, rhetorical design logic seeks to create the context using the designed messages. This creating of the context is accomplished using [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[negotiation]]. For coordination, rhetorical design seeks to repeatedly solve coordination problems in order to create the social reality.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; For negotiation, communication operates under the presumption that it can “strategically exploit” meaning. Rhetorical message producers always “seek to achieve consensus and social legitimation for the reality they speak,” thus having the possibility of negotiation always available.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Their messages are proactive rather than reactive, so they are designed towards effects rather than in response to the actions of others.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Rhetorical messages also normally contain “elaborating and contextualizing clauses and phrases that provide explicit definitions of the context.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Lastly, O’Keefe summarizes the internal coherence of rhetorical designed messages as deriving from “the elements being related by intersubjectively available, goal-oriented schemes.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Verification and other uses ==

Many other scholars have verified and used O’Keefe’s work for their own research . For example, Peterson and Albrecht uses Message Design Logic to posit the relationship between superiors’ and subordinates’ message design logic types.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; Likewise, another study done explored the relationships among individuals’ message design logics and their levels of social well-being.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Dr. Gwen Hullman used Message Design Logic to help in the study of perceptions of communication [[Skill|competence]]. The conclusion of her research in relation to message design was that, “speakers of rhetorical regulative messages were perceived as more effective, more appropriate, and were rated as more competent.”&lt;ref&gt;Hullman, G. A. (2004). Interpersonal Communication Motives and Message Design Logic:
Exploring Their Interaction on Perceptions of Competence. Communication Monographs, 71(2), 208-225.
&lt;/ref&gt; These findings reflect the ideas O’Keefe stated in her original work in that rhetorical speakers can better align their goals with their partner's goals.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

O’Keefe’s Message Design Logic has also been used in a study done in 2005 by Carmen Cortes, Chad Larson, and Dale Hample. Their study was designed to see if the difference in interpersonal construct differentiation reflected the sophistication with which they designed their messages.&lt;ref name="Cortes"&gt;Cortes, C., Larson, C., &amp; Hample, D. (2005). Relations Among Message Design Logic, Interpersonal Construct Differentiation, and Sex for Mexican and US Nationals. Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 34(1/2), 108-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Dr. Hullman’s study, this article resulted as O’Keefe had predicted in her 1988 study, in which O’Keefe said that people who are more differentiated also tend to employ more sophisticated logics in a challenging situation.&lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt; What Cortes, Larson, and Hample found is that “differentiation reflects the sophistication with which a person perceives others, and a Message Design Logic is a knowledge structure regarding communication.” &lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===

While critics of this theory are hard to find, Joy Hart of Louisville University reviews and examines O’Keefe’s work, including a full critique of assumptions she believes are being made. Hart claims that O’Keefe “assumes a developmental continuum for communication skill.”  &lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; She examines the assumption that individuals may progress to the rhetorical message design logic, which is the highest level of development. She critiques this assumption as it is seen through cultural and intercultural differences. A specific assumption which Hart criticizes is the proposition that if a person is surrounded by a social environment or culture in which negotiation is possible, then that person will proceed more quickly to the rhetorical message design logic.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

== Introduction ==
All plants and animals, from [[protist|simple life forms]] to humans, live in close association with microbial organisms.&lt;ref name="Mendes2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Mendes | first1=R. | last2=Raaijmakers | first2=J.M. | doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.7 | title=Cross-kingdom similarities in microbiome functions | journal=The ISME Journal | volume=9 | issue=9 | pages=1905–1907 | year=2015 | pmid= 25647346| pmc=4542044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several advances have driven the perception of microbiomes,  including:

* the ability to perform genomic and gene expression analyses of single cells and of entire microbial communities in the disciplines of [[metagenomics]] and [[metatranscriptomics]]&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;
* databases accessible to researchers across multiple disciplines&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;
* methods of mathematical analysis suitable for complex data sets&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;

Biologists have come to appreciate that microbes make up an important part of an organism's [[phenotype]], far beyond the occasional symbiotic case study.&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Bosch | first1=T. C. G. | last2=McFall-Ngai | first2=M. J. | doi=10.1016/j.zool.2011.04.001 | title=Metaorganisms as the new frontier | journal=Zoology | volume=114 | issue=4 | pages=185–190 | year=2011 | pmid= 21737250| pmc=3992624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of host relationships===
[[Commensalism]], a concept developed by [[Pierre-Joseph van Beneden]] (1809-1894), a Belgian professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] during the nineteenth century &lt;ref&gt;Poreau B., ''[http://www.theses.fr/2014LYO10114   Biologie et complexité : histoire et modèles du commensalisme]''. PhD Dissertation, University of Lyon, France, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; is central to the microbiome, where microbiota colonize a host in a non-harmful coexistence. The relationship with their host is called [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] when organisms perform tasks that are known to be useful for the host,&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;{{rp|700}}&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Quigley | first1=E. M. | date=Sep 2013 | title=Gut bacteria in health and disease | journal=Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y) | volume=9 | issue=9| pages=560–9 | pmid=24729765 | pmc=3983973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[parasitism|parasitic]], when disadvantageous to the host. Other authors define a situation as mutualistic where both benefit, and commensal, where the unaffected host benefits the symbiont.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; A nutrient exchange may be bidirectional or unidirectional, may be context dependent and may occur in diverse ways.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; Microbiota that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are deemed ''normal flora'' or ''normal microbiota''.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;

===Acquisition and change===
The [[initial acquisition of microbiota]] in animals from mammalians to marine [[sponge]]s is at birth, and may even occur through the germ cell line. In plants, the colonizing process can be initiated below ground in the [[Rhizosphere|root zone]], around the germinating seed, the [[spermosphere]], or originate from the above ground parts, the [[phyllosphere]] and the [[flower]] zone or anthosphere.&lt;ref name= pgpg/&gt; The stability of the rhizosphere microbiota over generations depends upon the plant type but even more on the soil composition, i.e. living and non living environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tkacz | first1=Andrzej | last2=Cheema | first2=Jitender | last3=Chandra | first3=Govind | last4=Grant | first4=Alastair | last5=Poole | first5=Philip S. | date=Nov 2015 | title=Stability and succession of the rhizosphere microbiota depends upon plant type and soil composition | journal=ISME J. | volume=9 | issue=11 | pages=2349–2359 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.41 | pmc=4611498 | pmid=25909975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Insects have their own microbiomes.

== Co-evolution of microbiota ==
{{Main|Hologenome theory of evolution}}
[[File:Keppelbleaching.jpg|thumb|200px|Bleached branching coral (foreground) and normal branching coral (background). Keppel Islands, [[Great Barrier Reef]]]]
Organisms evolve within eco-systems so that the change of one organism affects the change of others. [[Coevolution|Co-evolution]] (also called "hologenome theory") proposes that an object of natural selection is not the individual organism, but the organism together with its associated organisms, including its microbial communities.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

'''Coral reefs'''. The hologenome theory originated in studies on coral reefs. Coral reefs are the largest structures created by living organisms, and contain abundant and highly complex microbial communities. Over the past several decades, major declines in coral populations have occurred. [[Climate change]], water pollution and over-fishing are three stress factors that have been described as leading to disease susceptibility. Over twenty different coral diseases have been described, but of these, only a handful have had their causative agents isolated and characterized. [[Coral bleaching]] is the most serious of these diseases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the bleaching of ''[[Oculina]] patagonica'' was first described in 1994 and shortly determined to be due to infection by [[Vibrio shiloi]]. From 1994 to 2002, bacterial bleaching of ''O. patagonica'' occurred every summer in the eastern Mediterranean. Surprisingly, however, after 2003, ''O. patagonica'' in the eastern Mediterranean has been resistant to ''V. shiloi'' infection, although other diseases still cause bleaching. The surprise stems from the knowledge that corals are long lived, with lifespans on the order of decades,&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baird AH, Bhagooli R, Ralph PJ, Takahashi S |title=Coral bleaching: the role of the host |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16–20 |url=http://www.reefresilience.org/pdf/Baird_etal_2009.pdf |pmid=19022522|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not have [[adaptive immune system]]s.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} Their [[innate immune system]]s do not produce antibodies, and they should seemingly not be able to respond to new challenges except over evolutionary time scales.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

The puzzle of how corals managed to acquire resistance to a specific pathogen led to a 2007 proposal, that a dynamic relationship exists between corals and their symbiotic microbial communities. It is thought that by altering its composition, the [[holobiont]] can adapt to changing environmental conditions far more rapidly than by genetic mutation and selection alone. Extrapolating this hypothesis to other organisms, including higher plants and animals, led to the proposal of the "hologenome theory of evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenberg E, Koren O, Reshef L, Efrony R, Zilber-Rosenberg I|title=The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=5|pages=355–362|pmid=17384666|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of |2007}} the hologenome theory was still being debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Leggat W, Ainsworth T, Bythell J, Dove S, Gates R, Hoegh-Guldberg O, Iglesias-Prieto R, Yellowlees D | title=The hologenome theory disregards the coral holobiont

| issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A major criticism has been the claim that ''V. shiloi'' was misidentified as the causative agent of coral bleaching, and that its presence in bleached ''O. patagonica'' was simply that of opportunistic colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Ainsworth TD, Fine M, Roff G, Hoegh-Guldberg O | title=Bacteria are not the primary cause of bleaching in the Mediterranean coral ''Oculina patagonica''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, the basic observation leading to the theory would be invalid. The theory has gained significant popularity as a way of explaining rapid changes in adaptation that cannot otherwise be explained by traditional mechanisms of natural selection. Within the hologenome theory, the holobiont has not only become the principal unit of natural selection but also the result of other step of integration that it is also observed at the cell ([[symbiogenesis]], [[endosymbiosis]]) and genomic levels.&lt;ref name="Salvucci2014"/&gt;

=== Targeted amplicon sequencing ===

Targeted [[amplicon]] sequencing relies on having some expectations about the composition of the community that is being studied. In target amplicon sequencing a phylogenetically informative marker is targeted for sequencing. Such a marker should be present in ideally all the expected organisms. It should also evolve in such a way that it is conserved enough that primers can target genes from a wide range of organisms while evolving quickly enough to allow for finer resolution at the taxonomic level. A common marker for human microbiome studies is the gene for bacterial [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] (''i.e.'' "16S rDNA", the sequence of DNA which encodes the ribosomal RNA molecule).&lt;ref name="Kucz2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

The 16S rDNA gene contains both slowly evolving regions and fast evolving regions; the former can be used to design broad primers while the latter allow for finer taxonomic distinction. However, species-level resolution is not typically possible using the 16S rDNA. Primer selection is an important step, as anything that cannot be targeted by the primer will not be amplified and thus will not be detected. Different sets of primers have been shown to amplify different taxonomic groups due to sequence variation.

After the amplicons are sequenced, [[molecular phylogenetic]] methods are used to infer the composition of the microbial community. This is done by clustering the amplicons into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs) and inferring phylogenetic relationships between the sequences. Due to the complexity of the data, distance measures such as [[UniFrac]] distances are usually defined between microbiome samples, and downstream multivariate methods are carried out on the distance matrices. An important point is that the scale of data is extensive, and further approaches must be taken to identify patterns from the available information. Tools used to analyze the data include VAMPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAMPS: The Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures|url=http://vamps.mbl.edu/|publisher=Bay Paul Center, MBL, Woods Hole|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[QIIME]]&lt;ref name="CapoKucz2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

To determine the phylogenetic identity of a sequence, it is compared to available full genome sequences using methods such as [[BLAST]]. One drawback of this approach is that many members of microbial communities do not have a representative sequenced genome, but this applies to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well and is a fundamental problem.&lt;ref name=Kucz2012/&gt; With shotgun sequencing, it can be resolved by having a high coverage (50-100x) of the unknown genome, effectively doing a de novo [[genome assembly]]. As soon as there is a complete genome of an unknown organism available it can be compared phylogenetically and the organism put into its place in the [[tree of life]], by creating new [[Taxon|taxa]].

Despite the fact that metagenomics is limited by the availability of reference sequences, one significant advantage of metagenomics over targeted amplicon sequencing is that metagenomics data can elucidate the functional potential of the community DNA.&lt;ref name="MullerSzkl2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11280">'''Microspherulites''' are microscopic spherical particles with diameter less than two&amp;nbsp;mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek ''litos'' means "stone"). Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in [[aqueous]] [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.
Generally speaking, the common feature ([[sphericity]]) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).

==Classification==

Several types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as [[oolite]]s, [[micrometeorite]]s, impact spherulites, [[iberulite]]s, [[pisolite]]s, [[Meteorite|aerolites]], [[chondrule]]s, [[biolite]]s, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.

===Aqueous environment===
[[File:Detailed group of oolites.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1: Oolites observed with a transmitted light microscope.]]

* Oolites are internally structured spheres, composed mainly by [[calcium carbonate]] (Figure 1).  They are a type of constituent in [[limestone]]. The size of these [[ooid]]s ranges between 0.25 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm. The name derives from the Greek ''ooion'' (egg). They are formed by growing larger and accreting material as they move around. They accomplish this either (a) by physical attachment of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] material as they roll around, much in the manner of a snowball, and (b) by the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of material in solution, much as salt crystallizes from water during evaporation. In the former case they have thin concentric layers, and in the latter they have radiating sprays of crystals. However, a combination of both processes can be found. Microbes could contribute to their development.

===Aerial environment===

* Micrometeorites are typically metallic microspherules (iron or iron and nickel) but can also be formed by [[silicate minerals]], whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial [[meteoroids]], resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth’s atmosphere]]. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine that only a few minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.
* Impact spherulites occur when a large extraterrestrial object strikes Earth at cosmic velocity, melts and vaporizes, silicate materials can condense into high spheroidal, sand-sized particles deposited around the point of impact. Unaltered impact spherulites consist entirely of glass ([[Tektite|microtektites]]) or a combination of glass and crystals grown in flight (microkrystites). Primary crystals are only common in microspherulites from two [[Phanerozoic]] impact layers: the Upper Eocene microkrystite or [[clinopyroxene]] spherule layer &lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Glass, B.P., Burns, C.A., Crosbie, J.R., DuBois, D.L., 1985.

Frequently the crystals are replaced by [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phases such as [[goethite]], [[pyrite]], [[glauconite]], ''[[K-feldspar]]s'', [[quartz]], [[sericite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and ''carbonates''.

* [[Iberulite]]s are ''co-associations'' of well-defined minerals, together with non-crystalline compounds, with axial geometry and a characteristic depression (vortex), structured around a coarse-grained core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]]  rind, and pinkish colour (Figure 2). They are formed at present in the [[troposphere]] by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions. The modal size is in the 60-90 micrometre range, and the shapes are almost perfect spheres. Their name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], indicating the place where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr3"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., 2000.

The mineralogy of the core (tens of micrometres thick) is commonly formed by [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]]  and [[feldspar]]s, while the most frequent minerals of the rind (a few micrometres thick) are [[clay minerals]], mainly smectites (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]  and impregnation of [[sulfate minerals]]   (mainly [[gypsum]], [[alunite]] and [[jarosite]]) and [[halide minerals|chlorides]].&lt;ref name="vr4"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., Párraga, 2008.

==Other related terms==

* Pisolites are spheroidal particles, larger in size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek ''pisos'' (pea). Mineral concentrations ([[bauxite]]s, [[limonite]]s, [[siderite]]s) and the pedogenic [[Caliche (mineral)|caliches]] (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and for this reason they can not strictly be considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) &lt;ref name="vr5"&gt;Dunham, R.J., 1969. Vadose pisolites in the Capitan Reefs (Permian) New Mexico and Texas, in Depositional Environments in carbonate rocks: Soc. Econ. Palaeontologists and Mineralogists Spec. Publ. 14, 182-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) &lt;ref name="vr6"&gt;Esteban, M., Pray, L.C., 1977. Origin of the pisolite facies of the shelf crest. In: Upper Guadalupian facies Permian Reef complex, Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico and West Texas. 1977 Field Conference Guidebook.

[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gumo/1993_26/bibliography.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from [[brine]]s.

* Aerolite is a generic term indicating lithogenic elements gathered from the atmosphere. This term does not imply sphericity or microscopic size.
* Chondrules are the microscopic constituents of [[chondrite]]s that represent 80% of the [[meteorite]]s that fall to the Earth per the   [[Meteoritical Society]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Chondrules range in diameter from a few micrometres to over 1&amp;nbsp;cm. They are formed by rapid heating of solid precursor material and subsequent melting, followed by slow cooling. Their main composition is silicate minerals such as olivine and [[pyroxene]], surrounded by feldspars (crystalline or glassy); minor minerals are ''Fe-sulfide'', metallic Fe-Ni and [[oxide]]s.
* Biolites are biologically produced, many organisms can produce mineral particles dubbed in general biolites. Their shape, size and composition may be very varied. As examples we can cite [[otolith|otolites]] (compounds of the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]) and the calculi resulting from various [[histopathology|histopathologies]]. Studies have confirmed that microorganisms are able to precipitate minerals.&lt;ref name="vr7"&gt;Verrecchia, E.P., Freytet, P., Verrecchia, K.E., Dumont, J.L., 1995.

* Pellets are those homogeneous aggregates with no internal structure, consisting of [[Micrite|micritic calcite]], spherical to ellipsoidal in shape and with sizes between 0.03 and 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm. They are thought to be faecal particles from aquatic organisms.

[[File:Glass microspherulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 3: Solid glass microspheres used like ingredients in road and street signaling paintings.]]
* Bubbles include frequently unstable spherules which may be produced by the dispersion of two immiscible fluids forming an emulsion. Usually this term is applied to air-water [[emulsion]]s, but it is also valid for water-air (hazes, drops) or other liquid fluids (oil-water).
* Carbonaceous microspherules are a type of [[soot]] particle floating in the atmosphere, produced by [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] combustion processes of fuels, and may be coated with a layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates or both. These particles are hollow microspherules that are black in colour, and made up of carbon or [[graphite]]. The size ranges from tens to a hundred micrometres.
* Artefacts are spherules intentionally produced spherical particles for use in industry or medicine. The shape is often perfectly spherical, truly uniform and size ranging ~ 50&amp;nbsp;nm to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Nanoparticle|nanospheres]]), or 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 1000&amp;nbsp;µm ([[microsphere]]s). They may be made up of organic-inorganic compounds and provided with different properties. In fact, commercially, microspheres can be found manufactured from materials such as glass, polymers (polyethylene, polystyrene) or ceramic. Microspheres can be solid or hollow, and so their density will be very different as well as their applications. Hollow microspheres usually are added to reduce the density of a material. Solid microspheres have numerous applications depending on their size and their manufacture material. Solid glass microspheres are used in fields such as roads and streets signaling (Figure 3). They are added to paintings used for traffic signs and roadway surface signaling to incorporate the retroreflective effect. So they improve the night visibility of the way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Molse School''', ''translated as "School of Mol",'' is a common term for some international paint artists or a specific genre of paintings in late 19th and early 20th century.  The paintings typically show picturesque and rustic places, farms, ... of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[municipality]] [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], which is located in the [[Campine]].  The most famous painters of the  ''Molse School'' were [[Jakob Smits]] and [[Dirk Baksteen]] who lived in Achterbos, a hamlet of Mol.

Based upon the [[Barbizon school]] the municipality Mol organized an international art [[exhibition]] in 1907 and invited painters from all over the world.   Most of these artists had not met before and their only connection was their stay in a local [[hotel]] during the exhibition. These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing  212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its [[heath]], the white sand flats and how the inhabitants (mostly [[farmer]]s) lived.  This attempt succeeded.

Upon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues. This resulted in those colleagues also coming over to Mol making painting [[en plein air]] popular.

Some artists commonly categorized under the  ''Molse School'' are [[Dirk Baksteen]], [[Gerard Baksteen]], [[Charles Claessens]], [[Leon Delderenne]], [[Paul Mathieu]], [[Ernest Midy]], [[Erneste Rinquet]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Willem Battaille]], [[Emile Van Damme-Sylva]], [[Paula Van Rompa-Zenke]], [[Gaston De Biemme]]

'''Morphogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''morphê'' shape and ''genesis'' creation, literally, "beginning of the shape") is the [[biological process]] that causes an [[organism]] to develop its shape. It is one of three fundamental aspects of [[developmental biology]] along with the control of [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]], unified in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the [[Developmental biology|embryonic development]] of an [[organism]]. Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, in [[cell culture]] or inside [[tumor cell]] masses. Morphogenesis also describes the development of [[unicellular]] life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle, or describes the [[evolution]] of a body structure within a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]].

Morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by [[hormone]]s, by environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced by other organisms to [[toxin|toxic chemicals]] or [[radioactive isotope|radionuclides]] released as pollutants, and other plants, or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells.

==History==
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology#History}}

Some of the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions on how physical processes and constraints affect biological growth, and hence [[natural patterns]] such as the [[spirals]] of [[phyllotaxis]], were written by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] in his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''&lt;ref name=Thompson1917&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |author=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |title=On Growth and Form |url=https://archive.org/stream/ongrowthform1917thom#page/n7/mode/2up |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montell2008&gt;{{citation |date=5 December 2008 |author=Montell, Denise J |title=Morphogenetic Cell Movements: Diversity from Modular Mechanical Properties |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |pages=1502–1505 |url=http://irb.chu-montpellier.fr/fr/PDF/DU2009-I/15-12-2008_Introduction_Publi_2.pdf |bibcode=2008Sci...322.1502M |doi=10.1126/science.1164073 |pmid=19056976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[Alan Turing]] in his ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Turing | first= A.

==Genetic and molecular basis==
[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Evolutionary developmental biology|Morphogenesis is controlled]] by a [[evo-devo gene toolkit|"toolkit" of genes]] which switch development on and off at precise times and places. Here, [[gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes which create the body's segmental form.]]
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology|transcription factor|gene regulatory network}}

Several types of molecules are important in morphogenesis. [[Morphogen]]s are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation via concentration gradients. Morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. An important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are [[transcription factor]] proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with [[DNA]]. These can be coded for by master regulatory [[gene]]s, and either activate or deactivate the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of other genes; in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade of [[gene regulatory network]]s. At the end of this cascade are classes of molecules that control cellular behaviors such as [[cell migration]], or, more generally, their properties, such as [[cell adhesion]] or cell contractility. For example, during [[gastrulation]], clumps of [[stem cell]]s switch off their cell-to-cell adhesion, become migratory, and take up new positions within an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs. Developmental signaling pathways implicated in morphogenesis include Wnt, [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]], and ephrins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kouros-Mehr |first=H. |author2=Werb, Z.|title=Candidate regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis identified by genome-wide transcript analysis |journal=Dev. Dyn. |year=2006 |volume=235 |issue=12 |pages=3404–12 |pmid=17039550 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20978/abstract;jsessionid=D75C4FD14C482BF9B054F966403A15B4.d03t02 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20978 |pmc=2730892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==

[[File:P19 cell sorting out.png|thumb|upright|Cell sorting out with cultured [[P19 cell|P19 embryonal carcinoma cells]]. Live cells were stained with [[DiI]] (red) or DiO (green). The red cells were [[Genetic engineering|genetically altered]] and express higher levels of [[E-cadherin]] than the green cells. The mixed culture forms large multi-cellular aggregates.]]

At a tissue level, ignoring the means of control, morphogenesis arises because of cellular proliferation and motility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël|last2=Speroni |first2=Lucia |last3=Sonnenschein |first3=Carlos |last4=Soto |first4=Ana M. |date=2016 |title=Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells and their physical constraints|url=https://www.academia.edu/27958448/Modeling_mammary_organogenesis_from_biological_first_principles_cells_and_their_physical_constraints|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=58–69 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.004 |pmid=27544910|pmc=5563449 |arxiv=1702.03337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphogenesis also involves changes in the cellular structure or how cells interact in tissues. These changes can result in tissue elongation, thinning, folding, invasion or separation of one tissue into distinct layers. The latter case is often referred as [[cell sorting]]. Cell "sorting out" consists of cells moving so as to sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells of the same type. The ability of cells to do this has been proposed to arise from differential cell adhesion by [[Malcolm Steinberg]] through his [[Differential Adhesion Hypothesis]]. Tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic [[cellular differentiation]] events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal (see [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]). Mesenchymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue as a consequence of changes in cell adhesive and contractile properties. Following epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells can migrate away from an epithelium and then associate with other similar cells in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-243-7 |edition=6th |chapter=Morphogenesis and Cell Adhesion |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=morphogenesis&amp;rid=dbio.section.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell-cell adhesion===
During embryonic development, cells are restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell [[adhesion]] molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In [[cell culture]] cells that have the strongest adhesion move to the center of a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are [[cadherins]]. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other E-cadherin molecules. Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hulpiau, P.; van Roy, F. |title=Molecular evolution of the cadherin superfamily |journal=Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=349–69 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18848899 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Angst, B.; Marcozzi, C.; Magee, A. |title=The cadherin superfamily: diversity in form and function |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=114 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=629–41 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11171368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular matrix===
The [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is involved in keeping tissues separated, providing structural support or providing a structure for cells to migrate on. [[Collagen]], [[laminin]], and [[fibronectin]] are major ECM molecules that are secreted and assembled into sheets, fibers, and gels. Multisubunit transmembrane receptors called [[integrin]]s are used to bind to the ECM. Integrins bind extracellularly to fibronectin, laminin, or other ECM components, and intracellularly to [[microfilament]]-binding proteins [[ACTN1|α-actinin]] and [[talin (protein)|talin]] to link the [[cytoskeleton]] with the outside. Integrins also serve as receptors to trigger [[signal transduction]] cascades when binding to the ECM. A well-studied example of morphogenesis that involves ECM is [[mammary gland]] ductal branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fata JE, Werb Z, Bissell MJ |title=Regulation of mammary gland branching morphogenesis by the extracellular matrix and its remodeling enzymes |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2004 |pmid=14680479 |pmc=314442 |doi=10.1186/bcr634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternlicht MD |title=Key stages in mammary gland development: the cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=201 |year=2006 |pmid=16524451 |pmc=1413974 |doi=10.1186/bcr1368 |url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/8/1/201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell contractility===
Tissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell contractility. Just as in muscle cells, [[myosin]] can contract different parts of the cytoplasm to change its shape or structure. Myosin-driven contractility in embryonic tissue morphogenesis is seen during the separation of [[germ layers]] in the [[model organism]]s ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]]. There are often periodic pulses of contraction in embryonic morphogenesis. A model called the cell state splitter involves alternating cell contraction and expansion, initiated by a bistable organelle at the apical end of each cell. The organelle consists of [[microtubules]] and [[microfilaments]] in mechanical opposition. It responds to local mechanical perturbations caused by morphogenetic movements. These then trigger traveling [[embryonic differentiation waves]] of contraction or expansion over presumptive tissues that determine cell type and is followed by cell differentiation. The cell state splitter was first proposed to explain [[neural plate]] morphogenesis during [[gastrulation]] of the [[axolotl]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R, Brodland GW.

'''Multimedia'''  is [[content (media)|content]] that uses a combination of different [[content format|content forms]] such as text, audio, images, animations, video and [[interactive]] content. Multimedia contrasts with [[Media (communication)|media]] that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by [[information]] content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.  Multimedia devices are [[electronic media]] devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from [[mixed media]] in [[fine art]]; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with [[interactive media|interactive multimedia]], and "hypermedia" was an application of multimedia.

== Terminology ==
The term ''multimedia'' was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later '[[Bobb Goldsteinn]]') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at [[Southampton]], Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badii|first=Atta|last2=Fuschi|first2=David|last3=Khan|first3=Ali|last4=Adetoye|first4=Adedayo|date=2009-11-09|title=Accessibility-by-Design: A Framework for Delivery-Context-Aware Personalised Media Content Re-purposing|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|journal=HCI and Usability for e-Inclusion|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=209–226|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|isbn=9783642103070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.switched.com/2010/06/03/tech-art-history-part-2/|title=Tech Art History, Part| author= Matthew Zuras| publisher= Switched| date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ''multi-media'' music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Albarino, "Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton," ''Variety'', August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

[[File:Ford Show 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Multimedia (multi-image) setup for the 1988 Ford New Car Announcement Show, August 1987, Detroit, MI]] In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of [[Multi-Image|multi-projector slide shows]] timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s 'multimedia' took on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of ''Multimedia: Making It Work'', Tay Vaughan declared "Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is ''interactive multimedia''. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes ''hypermedia''."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Tay, 1993, Multimedia: Making It Work (first edition, {{ISBN|0-07-881869-9}}), Osborne/McGraw-Hill, Berkeley, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German language society [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]] recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of [[Word of the year (Germany)|German 'Word of the Year']] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l23/l0/F.html#featuredEntry ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German) [[Spiegel Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute summed up its rationale by stating "[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1–7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, ''multimedia'' refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of [[education software|educational]] multimedia [[CD-ROM]]s.

The term "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. ''[[Video]]'' is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of ''"[[footage]]"''  which is used to distinguish motion [[photography]] from ''"[[animation]]"'' of [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish [[:wiktionary:static|static]] media from [[:wiktionary:active|active]] media. In the [[fine arts]], for example, [[Leda Luss Luyken]]'s [[ModulArt]] brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making ''ModulArt'' an [[interactive]] multimedia form of art. [[Performing arts]] may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and [[theatrical property|props]] are multiple forms of both content and media.

== Major characteristics ==
'''Multimedia presentations''' may be viewed by person on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[Image projector|projected]], [[transmitted]], or played locally with a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]] electronic media technology. Digital [[online]] multimedia may be downloaded or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.

'''Multimedia games and simulations''' may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online [[Computer networking|network]], or locally with an offline computer, [[game console|game system]], or [[simulator]].

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.

[[File:Classical spectacular laser effects.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Laser lighting display|lasershow]] is a live multimedia performance.]]
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. [[Online]] multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] [[User innovation|end-user innovation]] and [[personalized|personalization]] on multiple forms of content over time.  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, [[haptic technology]] enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of [[taste]] and [[odor|smell]] may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into '''linear''' and '''non-linear''' categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a [[movie theater|cinema presentation]];
*Non-linear uses [[interactivity]] to control progress as with a [[video game]] or self-paced [[computer-based training]]. [[Hypermedia]] is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia [[presentation]]s can be '''live''' or '''recorded''':
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a [[Spatial navigation|navigation system]];
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/application ==
[[File:Steven Koonin BP 2005-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|A presentation using [[Microsoft PowerPoint|Powerpoint]]. Corporate presentations may combine all forms of media content.]]
Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[art]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[business]], scientific [[research]] and [[Visual thinking|spatial temporal applications]]. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
[[Creative industries]] use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to [[journalism]], to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.

==== Commercial uses ====
Much of the electronic [[old media|old]] and [[new media]] used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in [[advertising]]. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by [[creative services]] firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for [[governmental services]] and [[Nonprofit|nonprofit services]] applications as well.

==== Entertainment and fine arts ====
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop [[special effect]]s in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some [[video game]]s also use multimedia features.
Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called ''interactive multimedia''.
In the [[arts]] there are [[multimedia art]]ists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be [[Peter Greenaway]] who is melding [[Film|cinema]] with [[opera]] and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an [[art gallery]]. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.

=== Education ===
In [[education]], multimedia is used to produce [[computer-based training]] courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. [[Edutainment]] is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. [[cognitive load]] and [[multimedia learning]].

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lboro.academia.edu/DRoberts|title=David Roberts {{!}} Loughborough University - Academia.edu|website=lboro.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.

==== Educational technology ====
&lt;p&gt;Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in [[multi-disciplinary]] settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology &lt;ref name=":032"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik and Agarwal|first=S. and A.|date=October 2012|title=Use of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology
Tool–A Study|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/669a/07732895b025b68f9308560411c55040ade6.pdf|journal=International Journal of Information and Education Technology|volume=2|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of [[new media]] and [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andresen and Brink|first=Brent and Katja|date=2013|title=Multimedia in Education Curriculum|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002241/224187e.pdf|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizaiton|volume=|pages=140|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and [[digital media]] due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Betty|title=Anticipating the Impact of Multimedia in Education: Lessons from the Literature|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6401710/K26499__.PDF|journal=Computers in Adult Education and Training|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, [[interactive media]], communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. 

First introduced to [[social work]] education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. 

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. 

Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, "people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone." According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Weiyan|last2=Fang|first2=Fan|date=November 2008|title=Optimization of Multimedia English Teaching

Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on [[Howard Gardner|Gardner]]’s theory of the “[[Motivation in second-language learning|socio-educational model]] of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]].

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to [[The Seattle Globalist]], is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as [[Mojo (mobile journalist)|mojos]], from ''mo''bile ''jo''urnalist.

=== Engineering ===
[[Software engineer]]s may use multimedia in [[Simulations#Computer simulators|computer simulations]] for anything from entertainment to [[training]] such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for [[Graphical user interface|software interfaces]] are often done as a collaboration between [[creative professional]]s and software engineers.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===
In [[mathematics|mathematical]] and scientific [[research]], multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a [[scientist]] can look at a [[Molecular modelling|molecular model]] of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Multimedia]]''.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], [[Physician|doctors]] can get trained by looking at a virtual [[surgery]] or they can simulate how the [[human body]] is affected by [[disease]]s spread by [[virus]]es and [[bacterium|bacteria]] and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as [[virtual surgery|virtual surgeries]] also help doctors to get practical training.

== Associations and conferences ==
In Europe, the reference organisation for the multimedia industry is the [[European Multimedia Associations Convention]] (EMMAC).

Scholarly conferences about multimedia include:
* [[ACM Multimedia]]
* [[IEEE]] International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME)

'''''{{lang|en|Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces}}''''' is an [[open standard]] developed by the [[W3C|World Wide Web Consortium]] since 2005. It was published as a [[W3C recommendation#Recommendation .28WD.29|Recommendation]] of the W3C on October 25, 2012. The document is a [[Specification (technical standard)|technical report specifying]] a multimodal [[system architecture]] and its generic [[Software interface|interfaces]] to facilitate integration and [[multimodal interaction]] management in a computer  system. It has been developed by the  W3C's [[W3C MMI|Multimodal Interaction Working Group]].

==Description==
[[Image:MMI-Modalites.png|thumb|A multimodal architecture|250px|left]]
The ''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' recommendation introduces a generic structure and a communication protocol to allow the modules in a [[Multimodal interaction|multimodal]] system to communicate with each other.

This specification proposes an [[event-driven architecture]] as a general frame of reference focused in the [[control flow]] data exchange. It can be used to determine the basic infrastructures needed to command the application's multimodal services.

The architecture is also proposed to facilitate the task of implementing several types of multimodal services providers on multiple devices: mobile devices and cell phones, [[Domestic technology|home appliances]], [[Internet of Things]] objects, television and home networks, enterprise applications, web applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=RAGGETT, Dave. |author2=FROUMENTIN, Max.  |author3=HOSCHKA, Philipp.  |year=2004|title=Towards Multimodal Web Interaction|url =http://www.springerlink.com/content/m875422005157930/|journal=Building the Information Society |volume=156|publisher=Springer Boston|pages=133–138|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[intelligent car|"smart" cars]] or on medical devices and applications.

===Logical structure===
[[Image:MMI-Framework.png|thumb|The MMI Architecture in the MMI Runtime Framework|250px|left]]
''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' is the specified description of a larger services infrastructure called [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ The Runtime Framework] which provides the main functions that a multimodal system can need. This framework is at a higher level of abstraction than the MMI architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.larson-tech.com/Writings/multimodal.pdf|title=Standard Languages for Developing Multimodal Applications |author=James A. LARSON |date=22 February 2005|publisher=Larson Technical Services|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ The MMI Runtime Framework] is the [[Runtime system|runtime support]] and communication modules of the multimodal system  while MMI Architecture is the description and the specification of its main modules, its interfaces and its communication modes.

[[Image:MMI-MVC.png|thumb|The MVC design pattern in the MMI Architecture|250px|right]]
The ''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' specification is based on the [[Model–view–controller|MVC]] design pattern, that proposes to organize the [[user interface]] structure in three parts: the ''Model'', the ''View'' and the ''Controller''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-multimodarch1/#N1011B|title=The W3C Multimodal Architecture, Part 1: Overview and challenges. What you should know about the emerging architecture for distributed multimodal applications|author=Gerald MCCOBB |date=8 May 2007|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This design pattern is also shown by the Data-Flow-Presentation architecture from the Voice Browser Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Voice/2006/DFP|title=The Voice Browser DFP Framework|author=VBWG|date=8 Feb 2006|publisher=[[w3.org]]|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MMI-RusianDoll.png|thumb|Recursion in the MMI Architecture|250px|right]]
A particularity of this architecture is that although the presentation layer represented by the''View'' has traditionally been associated with [[Graphical user interface|graphical interfaces]]; this recommendation abstraction generalizes the ''View'' to the broader context of the [[multimodal interaction]], where the user can use a combination of visual, auditory, biometric and / or tactile modalities.

The MMI Architecture recommendation distinguishes three types of components: the '''''Interaction Manager''''' – IM, the '''''Data Component''''' – DC and the '''''[[Modality (human-computer interaction)|Modality]] Components''''' – MC. This distinction is similar to the separation between the ''Controller'', the ''Model'' and the presentation documents of the ''View'' in the MVC pattern.

Another characteristic is [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. The modules are black boxes and it is possible to encapsulate several components in a more complex component, which communicate with an '''''Interaction Manager''''' at a higher level. In this way, the architecture follows [[Nested hierarchy#Nested hierarchy|the nested dolls principle]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Patrizia |last=GRIFONI|year=2009|title=Multimodal Human Computer Interaction and Pervasive Services  |publisher=IGI Global|isbn=1-60566-386-7|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specification also covers the issues of a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] implementation on multiple material resources in a network or a [[Centralized computing|centralized]] implementation, with all the modules installed in a single material support. Information sharing between modules is [[Loose coupling|loose coupled]]. This promotes low dependence between modules, reducing the impact of changes in one module on other modules, and facilitating the modules' reuse. In this way, the modules have little or no knowledge of the functioning of any other modules and the communication between modules is done through the exchange of messages following a precise [[communication protocol]] provided by the architecture's [[API]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conversational-technologies.com/images/Distributed_Multimodality_in_the_W3C_Multimodal_Architecture.pdf|title=Distributed Multimodality in the W3C Multimodal Architecture|author=Deborah DAHL |date=26 April 2010|publisher=Conversational Technologies|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MMI architecture modules ==
[[Image:MMI-Modules.png|thumb|MMI Architecture Modules|250px|right]]

===The interaction manager===
The  interaction manager is a logical component, responsible for all message exchanges between the components of the system and the multimodal [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ Runtime Framework]. It is a [[Bus (computing)|communication bus]] and also an [[Event (computing)|event handler]].

Each application can configure at least one Interaction Manager to define the required interaction logic. This controller is the core of the multimodal interaction:
* It manages the specific behaviors triggered by the events exchanged between the various input and output components.
* It manages the communication between the modules and the [[Client (computing)|client application]].
* It ensures consistency between multiple inputs and outputs and provides a general perception of the application's current status.
* It is responsible for data synchronization.
* It is responsible for [[Focus (computing)|focus]] management.
* It manages communication with any other entity outside the system.

===The modality components===
The modality components are responsible for specific tasks, including handling inputs and outputs in various ways, such as speech, writing, video, etc..

These are logical entities that handles the input and output of different hardware devices (microphone, graphic tablet, keyboard) and software services (motion detection, biometric changes) associated with the multimodal system. For example, (see figure below), a modality component '''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;''' can be charged at the same time of the speech recognition and the audio input management. Another modality component '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' can manage the complementary command inputs on two different devices: a graphics tablet and a microphone. Two modality components '''&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt;''', can manage separately two complementary inputs given by a single device: a camcorder. And finally, a modality component '''&lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt;''', can use an external recognition web service and only be responsible for the control of communication exchanges needed for the recognition task.

[[Image:MMI-MC.png|thumb|Input abstraction in the modality components|1094px|center]]
In all four cases the system has a generic modality component for the detection of a voice command input, despite the differences in implementation. Any modality component can potentially wrap multiple features provided by multiple physical devices but also more than one modality component could be included in a single device. To this extent the modality component is an abstraction of the same kind of input handled and implemented differently in each case.

For this reason, the W3C recommendation currently does not describe in detail the structure or implementation of the modality components. It focuses only on the need of a communication interface with the Interaction Manager and the need of an implementation that follows a specific [[communication protocol]]: the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-mmi-arch-20110125/#LifeCycleEvents Life-Cycle Events].

[[Image:MMI-DC cases.png|thumb|Public and private data component|250px|right]]

===The data component===
The data component's primary role is to save the public data of the application that may be required by one or several modality components or by other modules (e.g., the [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ Framework's] session module).

The data component can be an internal module '''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;''' or an external module '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' to the Interaction Manager (see Figure). This depends on the implementation chosen by each application. However, the Interaction Manager is the only module that has direct access to the Data Component and only the Interaction Manager can view and edit the data and communicate with external servers if necessary. As a result, the Modality Components must use the Interaction Manager as an intermediary to access the public data of the multimodal application.

However, for the storage of private data, each Modality Component can implement its own Data Component. This private Data Component can also access external servers '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' (see Figure) and keep the data that the Modality Component may require, for example, in the speech recognition task. This can be the case of an implementation following the principle of nested dolls given by the MMI architecture recommendation.

==Communication protocol between different modules==
In the MMI architecture, the [[communication protocol]] is [[Asynchronous system|asynchronous]], bi-directional and based on the exchange of [[event notification]]s that are raised by the system following a user action or some internal activity.

This protocol defines the exchange mode and how to establish and end the communication between modules. In the case of this specification, it is reflected in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-mmi-arch-20110125/#LifeCycleEvents Life-Cycle Events]. These are six standard control events that are proposed for controlling devices and material services (such as a video player or a sound reproduction device) and two notifications proposed for monitoring the current status of the multimodal system.
[[Image:MMI-Events.png|thumb|The MMI Life-Cycle Events|250px|right]]

=== The Standard Life-Cycle Events ===
The specification recommends eight standard Life-Cycle Events specified as pairs of Request &gt; Response exchanges:
* '''NewContext''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e638 NewContextRequest / NewContextResponse] )
:Indicates the creation of a cycle of interaction (context) between zero, one or more users with one or multiple modality components. The context is the longest period of interaction in which the modules must keep the information available.
:The context is associated with the semantics of the user's and system's activity during the interaction cycle. This allows to the implementation decide whether to keeping the information still makes sense for the execution of the current activity.
:Usually the context is created from user input. The event is normally sent by one or more modality components to the interaction manager that must answer the query.
:For example, a modality component responsible for managing the inputs associated with the finger gesture ( touchmove ) in a web page viewed on a touch screen. At the beginning of the physical interaction, the modality component will send the query:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:newContextRequest requestID="myReq1" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" data="myMCStatus.xml" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:At this request the Interaction Manager will respond:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:newContextResponse requestID="myReq1" source="myIM.php" target="myPointerMC.php" context="myContextID1" status="success" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:It is also possible that the Interaction Manager is at the origin of the request. In this case the syntax remains the same but the value of '''''source''''' and '''''target''''' properties must change.

* '''ClearContext''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1576 ClearContextRequest / ClearContextResponse] )
:Sent by the interaction manager, the event marks the end of the cycle of interaction (context) and request the freed of the resources that were allocated to the current interaction context. The ClearContext event may be associated with the end of user or system activity. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:clearContextRequest requestID="myReq2" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID1" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:Upon receipt the request, the modality component may give as an answer:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:clearContextResponse requestID="myReq2" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID1" status="success" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Prepare''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e753 PrepareRequest / PrepareResponse] )
:Sent by the interaction manager, this event control signals to the modality component that it must be prepared to start its task and that it can load data that will be required to perform its work. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
&lt;mmi:prepareRequest requestID="myReq3" source="myIM.php" target="myDisplayMC.php" context="myContextID2" &gt;
&lt;mmi:content&gt;
&lt;svg:svg width="100%" height="100%" version="1.1"&gt;
&lt;rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:1; stroke:rgb(0,0,0)"/&gt;
&lt;/svg:svg&gt;
&lt;/mmi:content&gt;
&lt;/mmi:prepareRequest&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:If there are multiple documents or data to be loaded during the preparation phase, the Interaction Manager could trigger the PrepareRequest event several times without starting the task after each request. Nevertheless, each request call must be answered. In our example, if the content has been properly preloaded the answer is:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:prepareResponse requestID="myReq3" source="myDisplayMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="success" context="myContextID2"&gt;
&lt;/mmi:prepareResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Start''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#StartRequest StartRequest / StartResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager this control event signals to the Modality Component that it may start its task. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startRequest requestID="myReq4" source="myIM.php" target="myPlayerMC.php" context="myContextID3" data="myPlayerParams.xml"&gt;
&lt;mmi:contentURL href="myAnimation.swf"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startRequest&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:If during the execution of its work the Modality Component receives a new StartRequest event it may either start the new task, or report the failure. In the case of a successful execution the answer must be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startResponse requestID="myReq4" source="myPlayerMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="success" context="myContextID3"&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:In the case of a failure, the response may be for example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startResponse requestID="myReq4" source="myPlayerMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="failure" context="myContextID3"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusInfo&gt;
NoContent
&lt;/mmi:statusInfo&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Cancel''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1132 CancelRequest / CancelResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that it should stop its current task. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:cancelRequest requestID="myReq5" source="myIM.php" target="mySpokerMC.php" context="myContextID4" Immediate="true"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:The Modality Component response may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:cancelResponse requestID="myReq5" source="mySpokerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID4" status="success" data="myMCStatus.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Pause''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1257 PauseRequest / PauseResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that it must pause its current task. For example, the request for a Modality Component that manages the input of a graphics tablet may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:pauseRequest requestID="myReq6" source="myIM.php" target="myWriterMC.php" context="myContextID5" immediate="false"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:And the response of the Modality Component may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:pauseResponse requestID="myReq6" source="myWriterMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID5" status="success" data="myMCStatus.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Resume''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1385 ResumeRequest / ResumeResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that the task previously paused should resume:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:resumeRequest requestID="myReq7" source="myIM.php" target="myWriterMC.php" context="myContextID5"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:The Modality Component's response may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:resumeResponse requestID="myReq7" source="myWriterMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID5" status="success"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Status''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1697 StatusRequest / StatusResponse] )
:It is sent either by the Interaction Manager or by the Modality Components. This event indicates whether the cycle of interaction is still running, that is, if the context is "alive". For example, a Modality Component may need to monitor the status of the system to stop a process in case of fault or standby. In this case, it may send to the Interaction Manager :
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusRequest requestID="myReq8" source="myRecorderMC.php" target="myIM.php" requestAutomaticUpdate="true" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:Given that the request don't have the '''''context''''' parameter, the controller should return the system or the host server status and not the status of the current interaction context. To this request, the Interaction Manager may respond:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusResponse requestID="myReq8" source="myIM.php" target="myRecorderMC.php" status="alive" AutomaticUpdate="true" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== The Notifications ===
The specification also recommends two types of notifications, which one, the Extension Notification, can contain control or command data to handle devices or material services. For this reason this notification is regarded like an exception, a standard control event that is not described as a pair Request &gt; Response (in a previous version it was called the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-mmi-arch-20061211/#N103BB Data Event]). The two notifications are:
* '''Extension''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1515 ExtensionNotification] )
:This event is used to communicate application-specific control data or any other needed data. It can be generated  either by the Interaction Manager or by a Modality Component. It ensures the [[extensibility]] of the architecture by giving a generic API dedicated to the application-specific needs. For example, a Modality Component that handles a DVD player may indicate to the system an interaction with the DVD's main menu:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
     &lt;mmi:extensionNotification requestID="myReq9" source="myPlayerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID6" name="playerNavigation"&gt;
     &lt;applicationdata&gt;
         &lt;data id="menu" selected="true" /&gt;
     &lt;/applicationdata&gt;
     &lt;/mmi:extensionNotification&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Done''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1064 DoneNotification] )
:This notification is sent by the Modality Component to the Interaction Manager when it has finished its task. For example, when a recognizer Modality Component has finished the image recognition task (finding a face):
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
     &lt;mmi:doneNotification requestID="myReq10" source="myDetectorMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID7" status="success"&gt;
         &lt;mmi:data&gt;
           &lt;data id="detectionList"&gt;
               &lt;users&gt;
                   &lt;user id="u58" confidence=".85" /&gt;
                   &lt;user id="u32" confidence=".75" /&gt;
                   &lt;user id="u87" confidence=".60" /&gt;
               &lt;/users&gt;
           &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/mmi:data&gt;
     &lt;/mmi:doneNotification&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

From 1929&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parke Hughes ''Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880-1930'' JHU Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8018-4614-5}} page 376&lt;/ref&gt; to the late 1960s, large [[alternating current]] power systems were modelled and studied on '''AC network analyzers''' (also called '''alternating current network calculators''' or '''AC calculating boards''')  or '''transient network analyzers'''. These special-purpose [[analog computer]]s were an outgrowth of the DC calculating boards used in the very earliest power system analysis. By the middle of the 1950s, fifty network analyzers were in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eames, Ray Eames ''A Computer Perspective: Background to the Computer Age'',Harvard University Press, 1990 0674156269, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; AC network analyzers were much used for [[Power flow study|power flow studies]], short circuit calculations, and system stability studies, but were ultimately replaced by numerical solutions running on digital computers. While the analyzers could provide real-time simulation of events, with no concerns about numeric stability of algorithms, the analyzers were costly, inflexible, and limited in the number of buses and lines that could be simulated.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Laughton, D.F Warne (ed),''Electrical Engineer's Reference Book (16th Edition)'', Elsevier, 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-60119-452-7}} pages 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually powerful digital computers replaced analog network analyzers for practical calculations, but analog physical models for studying electrical transients are still in use.

== Calculating methods ==
As AC power systems became larger at the start of the 20th century, with more interconnected devices, the problem of calculating the expected behavior of the systems became more difficult. Manual methods were only practical for systems of a few sources and nodes. The complexity of practical problems made manual calculation techniques too laborious or inaccurate to be useful. Many mechanical aids to calculation were developed to solve problems relating to network power systems.

DC calculating boards used resistors and DC sources to represent an AC network. A resistor was used to model the inductive reactance of a circuit, while the actual series resistance of the circuit was neglected. The principle disadvantage was the inability to model complex impedances. However, for short-circuit fault studies, the effect of the resistance component was usually small. DC boards served to produce results accurate to around 20% error, sufficient for some purposes.

Artificial lines were used to analyze transmission lines. These carefully constructed replicas of the distributed inductance, capacitance and resistance of a full-size line were used to investigate propagation of impulses in lines and to validate theoretical calculations of transmission line properties. An artificial line was made by winding layers of wire around a glass cylinder, with interleaved sheets of tin foil, to give the model proportionally the same distributed inductance and capacitance as the full-size line.  Later, lumped-element approximations of transmission lines were found to give adequate precision for many calculations.

Laboratory investigations of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained by the use of direct-operated indicating instruments (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA.&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Kuehni, R.G. Lorraine, ''A New A-C Network Analyzer'', ''Transactions AIEE'', February 1938 volume 57 page 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint.  While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell, ''Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control and Computing Before Cybernetics'', JHU Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0801880572}}
 pp.149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale model==
A network analyzer system was essentially a [[scale model]] of the electrical properties of a specific power system. Generators, transmission lines, and loads were represented by miniature electrical components with scale values in proportion to the modeled system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kimbark|Edward Wilson Kimbark]], ''Power System Stability'',Wiley-IEEE ,1948, {{ISBN|0-7803-1135-3}} page 64 and following&lt;/ref&gt; Model components were interconnected with flexible cords to represent the [[schematic|schematic diagram]] of the modeled system.

Instead of using miniature rotating machines, accurately calibrated phase-shifting transformers were built to simulate electrical machines.  These were all energized by the same source (at local power frequency or from a motor-generator set) and so inherently maintained synchronism. The phase angle and terminal voltage of each simulated generator could be set using rotary scales on each phase-shifting transformer unit. Using the [[per-unit system]] allowed values to be conveniently interpreted without additional calculation.

To reduce the size of the model components, the network analyzer often was energized at a higher frequency than the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz [[utility frequency]]. The operating frequency was chosen to be high enough to allow high-quality inductors and capacitors to be made, and to be compatible with the available indicating instruments, but not so high that stray capacitance would affect results. Many systems used either 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, provided by a motor-generator set, to reduce size of model components. Some systems used 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, using capacitors and inductors similar to those used in radio electronics.

Model circuits were energized at relatively low voltages to allow for safe measurement with adequate precision. The model base quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified indicating instruments became more common, lower base quantities were feasible.  Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments to be used to measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified indicating instruments. By use of the [[per-unit system]], model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system.  Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Institution of Engineering and Technology , ''Power System Protection, Volumes 1-4'',  1995 {{ISBN|978-1-60119-889-1}} pages 216-220&lt;/ref&gt; Model components were single-phase devices, but using the [[symmetrical components]] method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.

A complete network analyzer was a system that filled a large room; one model was described as four bays of equipment, spanning a U-shaped arrangement 26 feet (8 metres) across. Companies such as [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] could provide consulting services based on their analyzers; but some large electrical utilities operated their own analyzers. The use of network analyzers allowed quick solutions to difficult calculation problems, and allowed problems to be analyzed that would otherwise be uneconomic to compute using manual calculations. Although expensive to build and operate, network analyzers often repaid their costs in reduced calculation time and expedited project schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Aad Blok, Greg Downey (ed) ''Uncovering Labour in Information Revolutions, 1750-2000'', Cambridge University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0521543533}}, pp. 76-80&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a stability study might indicate if a transmission line should have larger or differently spaced conductors to preserve stability margin during system faults; potentially saving many miles of cable and thousands of insulators.

Network analyzers did not directly simulate the dynamic effects of load application to machine dynamics (torque angle, and others).  Instead, the analyzer would be used to solve dynamic problems in a stepwise fashion, first calculating a load flow, then adjusting the phase angle of the machine in response to its power flow, and re-calculating the power flow.

In use, the system to be modelled would be represented as a [[One-line diagram|single line diagram]] and all the impedances of lines and machines would be scaled to model values on the analyzer. A plugging diagram would be prepared to show the interconnections to be made between the model elements. The circuit elements would be interconnected by patch cables. The model system would be energized, and measurements taken at the points of interest in the model; these could be scaled up to the values in the full-scale system.&lt;ref name=HarderGHN&gt;http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/e/ec/Chapter_6-Calculating_Power_(Edwin_L._Harder).pdf Calculating Power, retrieved 2013 Feb 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==The MIT network analyzer==
The network analyzer installed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) grew out of a 1924 thesis project by Hugh H. Spencer and [[Harold Locke Hazen]], investigating a power system modelling concept proposed by [[Vannevar Bush]]. Instead of miniature rotating machines, each generator was represented by a transformer with adjustable voltage and phase, all fed from a common source. This eliminated the poor accuracy of models with miniature machines.  The 1925 publication of this thesis attracted the attention at General Electric, where [[Robert Doherty (college president)|Robert Doherty]] was interested in modelling problems of system stability. He asked Hazen to verify that the model could accurately reproduce the behavior of machines during load changes.

Design and construction was carried out jointly by General Electric and MIT. When first demonstrated in June 1929, the system had eight phase-shifting transformers to represent synchronous machines. Other elements included 100 variable line resistors, 100 variable reactors, 32 fixed capacitors, and 40 adjustable load units. The analyzer was described in a 1930 paper by H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. The base quantities for the analyzer were 200 volts, and 0.5 amperes. Sensitive portable thermocouple-type instruments were used for measurement.&lt;ref&gt;H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. ''The M.I.T. Network Analyzer Design and Application to Power System Problems'', ''Transactions AIEEE'', July 1930 pp.1102-1113&lt;/ref&gt; The analyzer occupied four large panels, arranged in a U-shape, with tables in front of each section to hold measuring instruments. While primarily conceived as an educational tool, the analyzer saw considerable use by outside firms, who would pay to use the device.  [[American Gas and Electric Company]], the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and many other organizations studied problems on the MIT analyzer in its first decade of operation.  In 1940 the system was moved and expanded to handle more complex systems.

By 1953 the MIT analyzer was beginning to fall behind the state of the art.  Digital computers were first used on power system problems as early as "[[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]]" in 1949. Unlike most of the forty other analyzers in service by that point, the MIT instrument was energized at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, not 440 or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, making its components large, and expansion to new types of problems difficult. Many utility customers had bought their own network analyzers. The MIT system was dismantled and sold to the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority|Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Karl L. Wildes, Nilo A. Lindgren  ''A Century of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, 1882-1982'' MIT Press 1985 {{ISBN|0262231190}}, pp. 100-104&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial manufacturers ==

By 1947, fourteen network analyzers had been built at a total cost of about two million US dollars. General Electric built two full-scale network analyzers for its own work and for services to its clients. Westinghouse built systems for their internal use and provided more than 20 analyzers to utility and university clients. After the Second World War analyzers were known to be in use in France, the UK, Australia, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Later models had improvements such as centralized control of switching, central measurement bays, and chart recorders to automatically provide permanent records of results.

General Electric's Model 307 was a miniaturized AC network analyzer with four generator units and a single electronically amplified metering unit. It was targeted at utility companies to solve problems too large for hand computation but not worth the expense of renting time on a full size analyzer.  Like the Iowa State College analyzer, it used a system frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;kHz instead of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, allowing much smaller radio-style capacitor and inductors to be used to model power system components. The 307 was cataloged from 1957 and had a list of about 20 utility, educational and government customers. In 1959 its list price was $8,590.&lt;ref&gt;http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GE-Computer_Department_Data_Book_1960.pdf ''GE-Computer_Department_Data_Book_1960'', page 150-152, retrieved 2013 Feb 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the [[Metropolitan Edison Company]] and a group of six other electrical companies purchased a new Westinghouse AC network analyzer for installation at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia.  The system, described as the largest ever built,  cost $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19530204&amp;id=RVMmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nf8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=830,3636416 Gettysburg Times ''7 firms will put analyzer in institute'', February 4, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, network analyzers were installed starting in 1951. The [[Yokogawa Electric]] company introduced a model energized at 3980&amp;nbsp;Hz starting in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.iee.or.jp/ver2/honbu/14-magazine/log/2004/2004_08a_03.pdf Historical Trends and Interactive Relationship in Establishment of the

==Other applications==

===Transient analyzer===
A "transient network analyzer" was an analog model of a transmission system especially adapted to study high-frequency transient surges (such as those due to lightning or switching), instead of AC power frequency currents. Similarly to an AC network analyzer, they represented apparatus and lines with scaled inductances and resistances. A synchronously driven switch repeatedly applied a transient impulse to the model system, and the response at any point could be observed on an [[oscilloscope]] or recorded on an oscillograph. Some transient analyzers are still in use for research and education, sometimes combined with digital [[protective relay]]s or recording instruments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpri.in/about-us/departmentsunits/power-system-division-psd/transient-network-analyser.html
TNA at Central Power Research Institute, India retrieved 2013 Feb 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anacom===
The Westinghouse ''Anacom'' was an AC-energized electrical analog computer system used extensively for problems in mechanical design, structural elements, lubrication oil flow, and various transient problems including those due to lightning surges in electric power transmission systems. The excitation frequency of the computer could be varied. The Westinghouse Anacom constructed in 1948 was used up to the early 1990s for engineering calculations; its original cost was $500,000. The system was periodically updated and expanded; by the 1980s the Anacom could be run through many simulation cases unattended, under the control of a digital computer that automatically set up initial conditions and recorded the results. Westinghouse built a replica Anacom for [[Northwestern University]], sold an Anacom to [[ABB Group|ABB]], and twenty or thirty similar computers by other makers were used around the world.&lt;ref name=HarderGHN/&gt;

===Physics and chemistry===
Since the multiple elements of the AC network analyzer formed a powerful analog computer, occasionally problems in physics and chemistry were modeled (by such researchers as [[Gabriel Kron]] of [[General Electric]]), in the late 1940s prior to the ready availability of general-purpose digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metaphorik.de/12/tympasdalouka.pdf retrieved 2008 Jan 26&lt;/ref&gt; Another application was water flow in water distribution systems. The forces and displacements of a mechanical system could be readily modelled with the voltages and currents of a network analyzer, which allowed easy adjustment of properties such as the stiffness of a spring by, for example, changing the value of a capacitor. &lt;ref name=JS13/&gt;

===Structures===
The [[David Taylor Model Basin]] operated an AC network analyzer from the late 1950s until the mid-1960s. The system was used on problems in ship design. An electrical analog of the structural properties of a proposed ship, shaft, or other structure could be built, and tested for its vibrational modes.  Unlike AC analyzers used for power systems work, the exciting frequency was made continuously variable so that mechanical resonance effects could be investigated.

==Decline and obsolescence==
Even during the Depression and the Second World War, many network analyzers were constructed because of their great value in solving calculations related to electric power transmission. By the mid 1950s, about thirty analyzers were available in the United States, representing an oversupply.  Institutions such as MIT could no longer justify operating analyzers as paying clients barely covered operating expenses. &lt;ref name=JS13&gt; James S. Small, ''The Analogue Alternative: The Electronic Analogue Computer in Britain and the USA, 1930-1975'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|1134699026}}, pages 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;  

Once digital computers of adequate performance became available, the solution methods developed on analog network analyzers were migrated to the digital realm, where plugboards, switches and meter pointers were replaced with punch cards and printouts. The same general-purpose digital computer hardware that ran network studies could easily be dual-tasked with business functions such as payroll. Analog network analyzers faded from general use for load-flow and fault studies, although some persisted in transient studies for a while longer. Analog analyzers were dismantled and either sold off to other utilities, donated to engineering schools, or scrapped.

The fate of a few analyzers illustrates the trend. The analyzer purchased by [[American Electric Power]] was replaced by digital systems in 1961, and donated to [[Virginia Tech]]. The Westinghouse network analyzer purchased by the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]], Australia in 1950 was taken out of utility service in 1967 and donated to the Engineering department at [[Monash University]]; but by 1985, even instructional use of the analyzer was no longer practical and the system was finally dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/1763754 Photograph of part of a Westinghouse network analyzer, retrieved 2017 Aug 3&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor contributing to the obsolescence of analog models was the increasing complexity of interconnected power systems. Even a large analyzer could only represent a few machines, and perhaps a few score lines and busses. Digital computers routinely handled systems with thousands of busses and transmission lines.

==Background and principles==
NYC Agar Base was originally developed by Fauer, Weisburd and Wilson.,&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Second"&gt;Fauer, Weisburd and Wilson, 1973, Health Lab. Sci., 10: 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fauer Y. C., Weisburd M. H. and Wilson M. E., 1973, Health Lab Sci., 10(2) 61.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Department of Health]] for selective isolation of pathogenic ''[[Neisseria]]'' species from clinical specimens. It consists of primarily a peptone-corn starch agar-base buffered with [[phosphates]] and supplemented with horse [[Blood plasma|plasma]], horse [[haemoglobin]], [[dextrose]], [[Yeast extract#Autolyzed yeast|yeast autolysate]] and [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Second" /&gt; This medium is superior to other media generally employed for the isolation of ''[[Neisseria]]'' species.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, Schneible-Smith and Weiner, 1981, J. Clin. Microbiol.13:963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin P. J. and Reider S. V., 1957, J. Biol. Med., 29, 613&lt;/ref&gt; The transparent nature of the medium helps in studying the colonial types .&lt;ref&gt;MacFaddin J. F., 1985, Media for Isolation-Cultivation-Identification-Maintenance of Medical Bacteria, Vol. 1, Williams
and Wilkins, Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt;

Proteose peptone, horse plasma, [[haemoglobin]] provide nutrients for the growth of ''[[N. gonorrhoeae]]'' and ''[[N. meningitidis]]''. [[Phosphate]] [[Buffer solution|buffers]] the medium. The selective supplement added contains the antibiotics [[vancomycin]], [[colistin]], [[nystatin]] and [[trimethoprim]], to suppress the accompanying flora. [[Vancomycin]] is inhibitory for [[gram-positive]] bacteria. [[Colistin]] inhibits [[gram negative]] bacteria, including [[Pseudomonas|''Pseudomonas species'']], while [[Proteus]] is inhibited by [[trimethoprim]].&lt;ref name="Third"&gt;Knapp and Koumans. 1999. In Murray, Baron, Pfaller, Tenover and Yolken (ed.), Manual of clinical microbiology, 7th ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of [[trimethoprim]] and [[colistin]] acts [[Synergy#Drug synergy|synergistically]] against [[gram-negative bacilli]].&lt;ref&gt;. Simmons N. A., 1970, J. Clin. Pathol., 23, 757.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Starch]] neutralizes the toxic metabolites produced by ''[[Neisseria]]'' . The yeast autolysate supplement fulfils the [[CO2]] requirements needed to enhance ''[[Neisseria]]'' growth. Yeast contains [[oxaloacetic acid]] which is metabolized by [[gonococci]] to produce sufficient CO2 for growth of capnophilic gonococci.&lt;ref&gt;Lawton and Koch, 1982, J. Clin. Microbiol., 20: 905&lt;/ref&gt; Also, presence of yeast autolysate reduces the [[lag phase]] of growth of ''[[Neisseria]]'' , thus enhancing both size and number of colonies. The specimen can be directly streaked on the medium to obtain maximum isolation.

==Procedure==
[[File:Neisseria meningitidis Colonies growth on New York City Medium Agar.jpg|thumb|right|The growth of ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' colonies on New York City Medium Agar]]
[[Streaking (microbiology)|Streak]] the [[Sample (material)|specimen]] as soon as possible after it is received in the [[laboratory]]. If material is being [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] directly from a [[Cotton swab|swab]], proceed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control. 1975. Criteria and techniques for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, USPHS, Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Roll swab directly on the medium in a large “Z” to provide adequate exposure of swab to the [[Growth medium|medium]] for transfer of [[Microorganism|organisms]].
# Cross-streak the “Z” pattern with a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[Inoculation loop|wire loop]], preferably in the [[clinic]]. If not done previously, cross-streaking should be done in the laboratory.
# Place the culture as soon as possible in an [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] environment enriched with [[carbon dioxide]].
# [[incubator (culture)|Incubate]] at 35 ± 2&amp;nbsp;°C and examine after [[night|overnight]] incubation and again after approximately 48 hours.
#[[Subculture (biology)|Subculture]] for identification of ''[[N. gonorrhoeae]]'' should be made within 18–24 hours. If shipped after incubation, colonies should be subcultured before performing biochemical identification tests in order to ensure that adequate viability is achieved.

==Expected Results==
Typical colonial morphology is as follows:&lt;ref name="Third" /&gt;

''[[N. gonorrhoeae]]'' may appear as small (0.5-1.0&amp;nbsp;mm) grayish white to colorless mucoid colonies.
''[[N. meningitidis]]'' appears as large colorless to bluish-gray mucoid colonies.

Colonies may be selected for [[Gram staining|Gram-staining]], [[Subculture (biology)|subculturing]] or other diagnostic procedures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">'''Oncotic pressure''', or '''colloid osmotic pressure''', is a form of [[osmotic pressure]] exerted by [[protein]]s, notably [[albumin]], in a blood vessel's plasma (blood/liquid) that usually tends to pull [[water]] into the circulatory system. It is the opposing force to [[capillary filtration pressure]] and [[interstitial]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} colloidal osmotic pressure. It has a major effect on the pressure across the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerular]] filter. However, this concept has been strongly criticised and attention has been shifted to the impact of the intravascular glycocalyx layer as major player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/87/2/198/442215/Microvascular-fluid-exchange-and-the-revised Microvascular fluid exchange and the revised Starling principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/113/5/772/324603 Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given?

==Description==
Throughout the body, dissolved compounds have an osmotic pressure.  Because large [[Blood proteins|plasma proteins]] cannot easily cross through the [[capillary]] walls, their effect on the osmotic pressure of the capillary interiors will, to some extent, balance out the tendency for fluid to leak out of the capillaries. In other words, the oncotic pressure tends to pull fluid into the capillaries. In conditions where plasma proteins are reduced, e.g. from being lost in the [[urine]] ([[proteinuria]]) or from [[malnutrition]], there will be a reduction in oncotic pressure and an increase in filtration across the capillary, resulting in excess fluid buildup in the tissues ([[edema]]).

The large majority of oncotic pressure in capillaries is generated by the presence of high quantities of [[albumin]], a protein that constitutes approximately 80% of the total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid.  The total oncotic pressure of an average capillary is about 28 mmHg with albumin contributing approximately 22 mmHg of this oncotic pressure.  Because blood proteins cannot escape through capillary endothelium, oncotic pressure of capillary beds tends to draw water into the vessels. It is necessary to understand the oncotic pressure as a balance; because the blood proteins reduce interior permeability, less plasma fluid can exit the vessel.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |type=Book |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |pages=187–188  |chapter=Chapter 16: The Microcirculation and the Lymphatic System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncotic pressure is represented by the symbol [[Pi (letter)|Π or π]] in the [[Starling equation]] and elsewhere,.

==Types of fluids==
In the clinical setting, there are two types of fluids that are used for intravenous drips: crystalloids and [[colloid]]s. Crystalloids are aqueous [[solution]]s of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as [[gelatin]].
Oncotic pressure values are approximately 290 mOsm per kg of water, which slightly differs from the osmotic pressure of the blood that has values approximating 300&amp;nbsp;mOsm /L.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ecozone Palearctic.svg|thumb|400px|The Palearctic realm]]

The '''Palearctic''' or '''Palaearctic''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s on the Earth's surface, first identified in the 19th century, and still in use today as the basis for [[Zoogeography|zoogeographic]] classification.  The Palearctic is the largest of the eight realms.  It stretches across all of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] north of the foothills of the [[Himalayas]], [[North Africa]], and the northern and central parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The realm consists of several [[ecoregion]]s:  the [[Euro-Siberian region]]; the [[Mediterranean Basin]]; the [[Sahara]] and [[Arabian Desert]]s; and [[Western Asia|Western]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[East Asia]]. The Palaearctic realm also has numerous rivers and lakes, forming several freshwater ecoregions. Some of the rivers were the source of water for the earliest recorded civilizations that used irrigation methods.

==History==

In an 1858 paper for the ''Proceedings of the [[Linnean Society]]'', British zoologist [[Philip Sclater]] first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world:  [[Palaearctic]], Aethiopian/[[Afrotropic]], [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]]/[[Indomalaya]]n, [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]], [[Nearctic]], and [[Neotropical]].  The six indicated general groupings of fauna, based on shared biogeography and large-scale geographic barriers to migration.

[[File:Wallace biogeography.jpg|thumb|500px|Frontispiece to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s book ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'']]

[[Alfred Wallace]] adopted Sclater's scheme for his book ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', published in 1876.  This is the same scheme that persists today, with relatively minor revisions, and the additional of two more realms:  [[Oceanian realm|Oceania]] and the [[Antarctic realm]].

==Major ecological regions==

The Palearctic realm includes mostly [[subarctic climate|boreal/subarctic-climate]] and [[temperate climate|temperate-climate]] ecoregions, which run across [[Eurasia]] from western Europe to the [[Bering Sea]].

===Euro-Siberian region===
The boreal and temperate Euro-Siberian region is the Palearctic's largest [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region, which transitions from [[tundra]] in the northern reaches of [[Russia]] and [[Scandinavia]] to the vast [[taiga]], the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent. South of the taiga are a belt of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] and [[temperate coniferous forest]]s. This vast Euro-Siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species, and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the [[Nearctic]] ecoregion of [[North America]]. Eurasia and North America were often connected by the [[Bering land bridge]], and have very similar [[mammal]] and bird fauna, with many Eurasian species having moved into North America, and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia. Many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single [[Holarctic]] realm. The Palearctic and Nearctic also share many plant species, which botanists call the [[Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora]].

===Mediterranean Basin===
{{main|Mediterranean Basin}}
The lands bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in southern Europe, north Africa, and western Asia are home to the [[Mediterranean Basin]] ecoregions, which together constitute the world's largest and most diverse [[mediterranean climate]] region of the world, with generally mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean basin's mosaic of [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] are home to 13,000 [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. The Mediterranean basin is also one of the world's most endangered biogeographic regions; only 4% of the region's original vegetation remains, and human activities, including overgrazing, [[deforestation]], and conversion of lands for pasture, agriculture, or urbanization, have degraded much of the region. Formerly the region was mostly covered with forests and woodlands, but heavy human use has reduced much of the region to the [[sclerophyll]] shrublands known as [[chaparral]], [[matorral]], [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], or [[garrigue]]. [[Conservation International]] has designated the Mediterranean basin as one of the world's [[biodiversity hotspot]]s.

===Sahara and Arabian deserts===
[[Horse latitudes|A great belt of deserts]], including the [[Atlantic coastal desert]], [[Sahara]] desert, and [[Arabian desert]], separates the Palearctic and [[Afrotropic]] ecoregions. This scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic realm; other biogeographers identify the realm boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north, which places the deserts in the Afrotropic, while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert.

===Western and Central Asia===
The [[Caucasus]] mountains, which run between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], are a particularly rich mix of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, and include the [[temperate rain forest]]s of the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]] ecoregion.

[[Central Asia]] and the [[Iranian plateau]] are home to dry [[steppe]] [[grasslands]] and [[desert]] basins, with montane forests, woodlands, and grasslands in the region's high mountains and plateaux. In southern Asia the boundary of the Palearctic is largely altitudinal. The middle altitude foothills of the [[Himalaya]] between about 2000–2500 m form the boundary between the Palearctic and [[Indomalaya]] ecoregions.

===East Asia===
[[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] are more humid and temperate than adjacent [[Siberia]] and Central Asia, and are home to rich temperate coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, which are now mostly limited to mountainous areas, as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use. East Asia was not much affected by glaciation in the [[ice age]]s, and retained 96 percent of [[Pliocene]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} tree genera, while Europe retained only 27 percent. In the subtropical region of southern China and southern edge of the Himalayas, the Palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of [[Indomalaya]], creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species. The [[mountains of southwest China]] are also designated as a [[biodiversity hotspot]]. In Southeastern Asia, high [[mountain range]]s form tongues of Palearctic flora and fauna in northern [[Indochina]] and southern [[China]]. Isolated small outposts ([[sky island]]s) occur as far south as central Myanmar (on [[Nat Ma Taung]], 3050 m), northernmost [[Vietnam]] (on [[Fan Si Pan]], 3140 m) and the high mountains of [[Taiwan]].

===Freshwater===
The realm contains several important [[freshwater ecoregion]]s as well, including the heavily developed [[rivers of Europe]], the [[rivers of Russia]], which flow into the [[Arctic]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Black Sea|Black]], and [[Caspian sea]]s, [[Siberia]]'s [[Lake Baikal]], the oldest and deepest lake on the planet, and Japan's ancient [[Lake Biwa]].

==Flora and fauna==
One bird family, the [[accentor]]s (Prunellidae) is endemic to the Palearctic region. The Holarctic has four other endemic bird families: the divers or [[loon]]s (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae).

There are no endemic [[mammal]] orders in the region, but several families are endemic: Calomyscidae ([[mouse-like hamster]]s), [[Prolagidae]], and Ailuridae ([[red panda]]s). Several mammal species originated in the Palearctic, and spread to the Nearctic during [[Last glacial period|the Ice Age]], including the [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'', known in North America as the grizzly), [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'') in Europe and the closely related [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis'') in far eastern Siberia, [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), and [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus'', known in North America as the [[caribou]]).

===Megafaunal extinctions===
Several large Palearctic animals became extinct from the end of the [[Pleistocene]] into historic times, including the [[Irish elk]] (''Megaloceros giganteus''), [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius'') [[woolly rhinoceros]] (''Coelodonta antiquitatis''), [[woolly mammoth]] (''Mammuthus primigenius''), [[North African elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana pharaoensis''), [[Elephants in ancient China|Chinese elephant]] (''Elephas maximus rubridens''), [[cave bear]] (''Ursus spelaeus''), and [[History of lions in Europe|European lion]] (''Panthera leo europaea'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">A '''parliamentary leader''' is a political title or a descriptive term used in various countries to the person leading a [[caucus]] (or [[parliamentary group]]) in a legislative body, whether it be a national or sub-national legislature. A [[party leader]] may be the same person as the parliamentary leader, or the roles may be separated.

==Terminology==
In many countries, the position of [[party leader|leader of a political party]] (that is, the organisational leader) and leader of a parliamentary group are separate positions, and while they are often held by the same person,&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilet|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Cross|first2=William|title=The Selection of Political Party Leaders in Contemporary Parliamentary Democracies: A Comparative Study|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317929451|page=190|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2mvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not always or automatically the case. If the party leader is a member of the government, holds a different political office outside the parliamentary body in question, or no political office at all, the position of parliamentary leader is frequently held by a different person.&lt;ref name="Heidar"/&gt;

In English, the leader may be referred to as a "parliamentary chairman", "group leader"&lt;ref name="europarl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the leaders of Parliament's political groups|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20090710FCS58034+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "parliamentary leader", among other names.

==Examples==
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
===Canada===
{{See also|Interim leader (Canada)}}
A parliamentary leader is chosen in [[politics of Canada|Canadian politics]] to lead their [[caucus]] in a legislative body, whether it be the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] or a provincial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffrey|first1=Brooke|title=Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984-2008|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802038487|page=604|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGdYR_ZTyRAC&amp;pg=PA604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as interim legislative leaders, when a party leader either has no seat in the legislative body, during a transition period preceding, or following a leadership contest.

===European Parliament===
Each of the seven [[political groups of the European Parliament]] has its own group leader. The groups within the European Parliament are often very broad, so the position of the group leader is a unifying one—they may help to consolidate MEPs with similar outlooks ahead of important votes.&lt;ref name="europarl"/&gt; The groups are organisationally separate from a [[European political party]], and multiple parties often ally as a single group, thus the distinction between a party and a parliamentary leader is usually strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political groups in the European Parliament. Parties in EU.|url=http://www.itsyourparliament.eu/groups/|website=www.itsyourparliament.eu|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In German politics, leaders of the major parties have often been heads of government of the various states rather than members of the national parliament.&lt;ref name="Heidar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidar|first1=Knut|last2=Koole|first2=Ruud|title=Parliamentary Party Groups in European Democracies: Political Parties Behind Closed Doors|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134594764|page=33–34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rgGDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the position of parliamentary leader in the [[Bundestag|federal parliament]] (Germany also has 16 state parliaments) is often occupied by a different person. The parliamentary leader has the supreme responsibility for coordinating the work of the MPs representing his or her party. Even when the party leader is a member of the national parliament, the parliamentary leader can be a different person. For instance,
[[Friedrich Merz]] was parliamentary leader while [[Angela Merkel]] was party leader for some years while the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] was in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geis|first1=Matthias|last2=Hildebrandt|first2=Tina|title=Angela Merkel: Not Our Ms. Merkel|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-politics-germany-cdu/komplettansicht|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the party leader is the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] or a member of the government, another person always is the parliamentary leader.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===United Kingdom===

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Politics of Australia|Australian]] and [[New Zealand politics]], the party figure commonly described as "leader" is usually an MP responsible for managing the party's business within parliament. Party constitutions will typically distinguish between the parliamentary leader and the organisational leader (who typically is outside of parliament), with the latter often termed a "federal president" or "party president".&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Party Constitution and Rules|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/Labour_Party_Rules_1.pdf|website=www.elections.org.nz|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two roles are organisationally distinct even if close cooperation is expected.&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17173">{{dablink|This article is about molecular photodissociation. The term "photodissociation" may also refer to nuclear photodissociation.}}

'''Photodissociation''', '''photolysis''', or '''photodecomposition''' is a [[chemical reaction]] in which a [[chemical compound]] is broken down by [[photon]]s.  It is defined as the interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. 
Photodissociation is not limited to [[visible light]].  Any photon with sufficient [[energy]] can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound.  Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, [[electromagnetic wave]]s with the energy of visible light or higher, such as [[ultraviolet light]], [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s are usually involved in such reactions.

==Photolysis in photosynthesis==
Photolysis is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of [[photosynthesis]]. The general reaction of photosynthetic photolysis can be given as

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A + 2 photons (light) → 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A

The chemical nature of "A" depends on the type of organism.  In [[purple sulfur bacteria]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is oxidized to sulfur (S). In oxygenic photosynthesis, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) serves as a substrate for photolysis resulting in the generation of [[dioxygen|diatomic oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This is the process which returns oxygen to Earth's atmosphere. Photolysis of water occurs in the [[thylakoid]]s of [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s.

=== Energy transfer models ===
The conventional, [[First quantization|semi-classical]], model describes the photosynthetic energy transfer process as one in which excitation energy hops from light-capturing pigment molecules to reaction center molecules step-by-step down the molecular energy ladder.

The effectiveness of photons of different wavelengths depends on the absorption spectra of the [[photosynthetic pigment]]s in the organism. [[Chlorophyll]]s absorb light in the violet-blue and red parts of the spectrum, while [[accessory pigment]]s capture other wavelengths as well. The [[phycobilin]]s of red algae absorb blue-green light which penetrates deeper into water than red light, enabling them to photosynthesize in deep waters. Each absorbed photon causes the formation of an [[exciton]] (an electron excited to a higher energy state) in the pigment molecule. The energy of the exciton is transferred to a [[chlorophyll]] molecule ([[P680]], where P stands for pigment and 680 for its absorption maximum at 680&amp;nbsp;nm) in the reaction center of [[photosystem II]] via [[resonance energy transfer]]. P680 can also directly absorb a photon at a suitable wavelength.

Photolysis during photosynthesis occurs in a series of light-driven [[Redox|oxidation]] events. The energized electron (exciton) of P680 is captured by a primary electron acceptor of the photosynthetic [[electron transfer chain]] and thus exits photosystem II. In order to repeat the reaction, the electron in the reaction center needs to be replenished. This occurs by oxidation of water in the case of oxygenic photosynthesis. The electron-deficient reaction center of photosystem II (P680*) is the strongest [[Biological oxidizer|biological oxidizing agent]] yet discovered, which allows it to break apart molecules as stable as water.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Campbell]]| first = Neil A. |author2=Reece, Jane B. | title = Biology | edition = 7th | publisher = Pearson - Benjamin Cummings | date = 2005 | location = San Francisco | pages = 186–191 | isbn = 0-8053-7171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-splitting reaction is catalyzed by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] of photosystem II. This protein-bound inorganic complex contains four manganese ions, plus calcium and chloride ions as cofactors. Two water molecules are complexed by the manganese cluster, which then undergoes a series of four electron removals (oxidations) to replenish the reaction center of photosystem II. At the end of this cycle, free oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is generated and the hydrogen of the water molecules has been converted to four protons released into the thylakoid lumen (Dolai's S-state diagrams).&lt;ref&gt;  Dolai, U. (2017). "Chemical Scheme of Water -Splitting Process during Photosynthesis by the way of Experimental Analysis ". IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences.  12(6):65-67. doi: 10.9790/3008-1206026567. ISSN 2319-7676.&lt;/ref&gt;

These protons, as well as additional protons pumped across the thylakoid membrane coupled with the electron transfer chain, form a [[proton gradient]] across the membrane that drives [[photophosphorylation]] and thus the generation of chemical energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). The electrons reach the [[P700]] reaction center of [[photosystem I]] where they are energized again by light. They are passed down another electron transfer chain and finally combine with the [[coenzyme]] NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and protons outside the thylakoids to form [[NADPH]]. Thus, the net oxidation reaction of water photolysis can be written as:

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 8 photons (light) → 2 NADPH + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The free energy change (ΔG) for this reaction is 102 kilocalories per mole. Since the energy of light at 700&amp;nbsp;nm is about 40 kilocalories per mole of photons, approximately 320 kilocalories of light energy are available for the reaction. Therefore, approximately one-third of the available light energy is captured as NADPH during photolysis and electron transfer. An equal amount of ATP is generated by the resulting proton gradient. Oxygen as a byproduct is of no further use to the reaction and thus released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F.

==== Quantum models ====

In 2007 a quantum model was proposed by [[Graham Fleming]] and his co-workers which includes the possibility that photosynthetic energy transfer might involve quantum oscillations, explaining its unusually high [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref name="QB"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engel Gregory S., Calhoun Tessa R., Read Elizabeth L., Ahn Tae-Kyu, Mančal Tomáš, Cheng Yuan-Chung, Blankenship Robert E., Fleming Graham R. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 446 | issue = | pages = 782–786 | doi=10.1038/nature05678| bibcode = 2007Natur.446..782E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fleming&lt;ref name="QBC"&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news95605211.html Quantum secrets of photosynthesis revealed&lt;/ref&gt; there is direct evidence that remarkably long-lived wavelike electronic quantum coherence plays an important part in energy transfer processes during photosynthesis, which can explain the extreme efficiency of the energy transfer because it enables the system to sample all the potential energy pathways, with low loss, and choose the most efficient one. This claim has, however, since been proven wrong in several publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. Tempelaar | author2 = T. L. C. Jansen | author3 = J.

This approach has been further investigated by Gregory Scholes and his team at the [[University of Toronto]], which in early 2010 published research results that indicate that some marine algae make use of [[quantum coherence|quantum-coherent]] electronic [[energy transfer]] (EET) to enhance the efficiency of their energy harnessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/staff/SCHOLES/scholes_home.html Scholes Group Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Photoinduced proton transfer==
[[Photoacid]]s are molecules that upon light absorption undergo a proton transfer to form the photobase.

:&lt;chem&gt;AH -&gt;[h\nu] A^- + H^+&lt;/chem&gt;

In these reactions the dissociation occurs in the electronically excited state. After proton transfer and relaxation to the electronic ground state, the proton and acid recombine to form the [[photoacid]] again.

[[photoacid]]s are a convenient source to induce pH jumps in [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] experiments.

==Photolysis in the atmosphere==
Photolysis occurs in the atmosphere as part of a series of reactions by which primary [[pollutants]] such as [[hydrocarbons]] and [[nitrogen oxides]] react to form secondary pollutants such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]]. See [[photochemical smog]].

The two most important photodissociaton reactions in the [[troposphere]] are firstly:

:O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + h&amp;nu; &amp;rarr; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lambda; &lt; 320 nm

which generates an excited oxygen atom which can react with water to give the [[hydroxyl radical]]:

:O(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 2 &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH

The hydroxyl radical is central to [[atmospheric chemistry]] as it initiates the [[oxidation]] of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and so acts as a [[detergent]].

Secondly the reaction:

:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + h&amp;nu; &amp;rarr; NO + O

is a key reaction in the formation of [[tropospheric ozone]].

The formation of the [[ozone layer]] is also caused by photodissociation. Ozone in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] is created by ultraviolet light striking oxygen molecules containing two oxygen [[atom]]s (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), splitting them into individual oxygen atoms (atomic oxygen).  The atomic oxygen then combines with unbroken O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, photolysis is the process by which [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s are broken down in the upper atmosphere to form ozone-destroying chlorine [[free radicals]].

==Astrophysics==
In [[astrophysics]], photodissociation is one of the major processes through which molecules are broken down (but new molecules are being formed). Because of the [[vacuum]] of the [[interstellar medium]], molecules and [[free radical]]s can exist for a long time. Photodissociation is the main path by which molecules are broken down. Photodissociation rates are important in the study of the composition of [[interstellar clouds]] in which [[star]]s are formed.

Examples of photodissociation in the interstellar medium are ({{mvar|h&amp;nu;}} is the energy of a single [[photon]] of frequency {{mvar|&amp;nu;}}):

:&lt;chem&gt;H2O -&gt;[h\nu] H + OH&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 -&gt;[h\nu] CH3 + H&lt;/chem&gt;

== Atmospheric gamma-ray bursts ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Currently orbiting satellites detect an average of about one [[gamma-ray burst]] per day. Because gamma-ray bursts are visible to distances encompassing most of the [[observable universe]], a volume encompassing many billions of galaxies, this suggests that gamma-ray bursts must be exceedingly rare events per galaxy.

Measuring the exact rate of gamma-ray bursts is difficult, but for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the [[Milky Way]], the expected rate (for long GRBs) is about one burst every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years.&lt;ref name="rates"&gt;[[#Podsiadlowski|Podsiadlowski 2004]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few percent of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rates of short GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown beaming fraction, but are probably comparable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guetta|Guetta 2006]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, if close enough to Earth and beamed towards it, could have significant effects on the [[biosphere]]. The absorption of radiation in the atmosphere would cause photodissociation of [[nitrogen]], generating [[nitric oxide]] that would act as a catalyst to destroy [[ozone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorsett|Thorsett 1995]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmospheric photodissociation
* &lt;chem&gt;N2 -&gt; 2N&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;O2 -&gt; 2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;CO2 -&gt; C + 2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;H2O -&gt; 2H + O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;2NH3 -&gt; 3H2 + N2&lt;/chem&gt;
would yield
* NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (consumes up to 400 [[ozone]] molecules)
* CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (nominal)
* CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (nominal)
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

(incomplete)

According to a 2004 study, a GRB at a distance of about a [[parsec|kiloparsec]] could destroy up to half of Earth's [[ozone layer]]; the direct UV irradiation from the burst combined with additional solar UV radiation passing through the diminished ozone layer could then have potentially significant impacts on the [[food chain]] and potentially trigger a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="Melott2004"&gt;[[#Melott|Melott 2004]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;[[#Wanjek|Wanjek 2005]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors estimate that one such burst is expected per billion years, and hypothesize that the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]] could have been the result of such a burst.

There are strong indications that long gamma-ray bursts preferentially or exclusively occur in regions of low metallicity. Because the Milky Way has been metal-rich since before the Earth formed, this effect may diminish or even eliminate the possibility that a long gamma-ray burst has occurred within the Milky Way within the past billion years.&lt;ref name="Stanek"&gt;[[#Stanek|Stanek 2006]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such metallicity biases are known for short gamma-ray bursts. Thus, depending on their local rate and beaming properties, the possibility for a nearby event to have had a large impact on Earth at some point in geological time may still be significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ejzak|Ejzak 2007]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple photon dissociation==
Single photons in the [[infrared]] spectral range usually are not energetic enough for direct photodissociation of molecules. However, after absorption of multiple infrared photons a molecule may gain internal energy to overcome its barrier for dissociation. Multiple photon dissociation (MPD, [[Infrared multiphoton dissociation|IRMPD]] with infrared radiation) can be achieved by applying high power lasers, e.g. a [[carbon dioxide laser]], or a [[free electron laser]], or by long interaction times of the molecule with the radiation field without the possibility for rapid cooling, e.g. by collisions. The latter method allows even for MPD induced by [[black body radiation]], a technique called [[blackbody infrared radiative dissociation]] (BIRD).

'''Primary nutritional groups''' are groups of [[organism]]s, divided in relation to the nutrition mode according to the sources of energy and carbon, needed for living, growth and reproduction. The sources of energy can be light and organic or inorganic compounds; the sources of carbon can be of organic or inorganic origin.
&lt;ref&gt;Brock Biology of Microorganisms [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1694265&amp;rendertype=table&amp;id=t1 ''Definitions of metabolic strategies to obtain carbon and energy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[aerobic respiration]]'', ''[[anaerobic respiration]]'' and ''[[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]'' do not refer to primary nutritional groups, but simply reflect the different use of possible electron acceptors in particular organisms, such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in aerobic respiration, or [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) or fumarate in anaerobic respiration, or various metabolic intermediates in fermentation. Because all ATP-generating steps in fermentation involve modifications of metabolic intermediates instead of the use of an [[electron transport chain]] fermentation is often referred to as ''[[substrate-level phosphorylation]]''.

== Primary sources of energy ==
[[File:Troph flowchart.png|thumb|500px|center|Simplified flowchart for determining if an organism is an [[autotroph]], [[heterotroph]] or a subtype.]]

[[Phototroph]]s: Light is absorbed in [[Photosynthetic pigment|photo receptors]] and transformed into chemical energy.&lt;br&gt;
[[Chemotroph]]s: [[Bond energy]] is released from a [[chemical compound]].

The freed energy is stored as [[Potential energy#Chemical potential energy|potential energy]] in [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s or [[protein]]s. Eventually, the energy is used for life processes as moving, growth and reproduction.

Some bacteria can alternate phototrophy and chemotrophy, depending on availability of light.

== Primary sources of reducing equivalents ==

[[Organotroph]]s: Organic compounds are used as [[electron donor]].&lt;br&gt;
[[Lithotroph]]s: Inorganic compounds are used as electron donor.

The [[electron]]s from [[reducing equivalent]]s (electron donors) are needed by both phototrophs and chemotrophs, to keep running [[Redox|reduction-oxidation reactions]] that transfer energy in the anabolic processes of [[ATP synthesis]] (in heterotrophs) or [[biosynthesis]] (in autotrophs). The electron donors are taken up from the environment.

Organotrophic organisms are often also heterotrophic, using organic compounds as sources of electrons and carbon at the same time. Similarly, lithotrophic organisms are often also autotrophic, using inorganic sources of electrons and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as inorganic carbon source.

Some lithotrophic bacteria can utilize diverse sources of electrons, depending on availability of possible donors.

The organic or inorganic substances (e.g., oxygen) used as electron acceptors needed in the catabolic processes of aerobic or anaerobic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and [[fermentation]] are not taken into account here.

For example, plants use water as electron donor to biosynthesis, being lithotrophs. Animals use organic compounds as electron donors to synthesize ATP, being organotrophs (plants also do it, but this is not taken into account). Both use oxygen in respiration as electron acceptor, but this character is not used to define them as lithotrophs.

== Primary sources of carbon ==

[[Heterotroph]]s: Organic compounds are [[Metabolism|metabolized]] to get carbon for growth and development.&lt;br&gt;
[[Autotroph]]s: [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as source of carbon.

A ''chemoorganoheterotrophic'' [[organism]] is one that requires organic [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] to get its [[carbon]] for growth and development, and that produces its energy from the oxidation and reduction ([[redox]]) of an organic compound. This group of organisms may be further subdivided according to what kind of organic substrate and compound they use. [[Decomposers]] are examples of Chemoorganoheterotrophs which obtain carbon and electron reactions from dead organic matter. [[Herbivores]] and [[carnivores]] are examples of organisms that obtain carbon and electron reactions from living organic matter.

Chemoorganotrophs are [[organism]]s which oxidize the chemical bonds in [[organic compound]]s as their energy source.  Chemoorganotrophs also attain the carbon molecules that they need for cellular function from these organic compounds.  The organic compounds that they oxidize include sugars (i.e. [[glucose]]), fats and proteins.&lt;ref name="kt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/nutgro.html|title=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology|accessdate=2014-04-19|year=2009|author=Kenneth Todar|work=Nutrition and Growth of Bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[animal]]s are chemoheterotrophs (meaning they oxidize chemical compounds as a source of energy and carbon), as are [[fungus|fungi]], [[protozoa]], and some [[bacteria]]. The important differentiation amongst this group is that chemoorganotrophs oxidize only organic compounds while [[chemolithotroph]]s instead use [[inorganic compound]]s as a source of energy.&lt;ref name="dk"&gt;{{cite book | title=Energy Metabolism in Chemolithotrophs| last=Kelly| first=DP|author2=Julie Mason |author3=Ann Wood | pages=186–187| publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Some authors use ''-hydro-'' when the source is water.

== Mixotrophs ==

Some, usually unicellular, organisms can switch between different metabolic modes, for example between photoautotrophy, photoheterotrophy, and chemoheterotrophy in ''Chroococcales''
&lt;ref&gt;R. Rippka [http://www.springerlink.com/content/wk108gw7336u621l/ ''Photoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy among unicellular blue-green algae''] Archives of Microbiology; 	Volume 87, Number 1 / March, 1972; {{doi|10.1007/BF00424781}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such [[mixotroph]]ic organisms may dominate their [[habitat]], due to their capability to use more resources than either photoautotrophic or organoheterotrophic organisms.
&lt;ref name='Eiler'&gt;Alexander Eiler [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1694265 ''Evidence for the Ubiquity of Mixotrophic Bacteria in the Upper Ocean: Implications and consequences''] Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 December; 72(12): 7431–7437; {{doi|10.1128/AEM.01559-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
All sorts of combinations may exist in nature. For example, most cyanobacteria are ''photoautotrophic'', since they use light as an energy source, water as electron donor, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a carbon source. Fungi are ''[[chemo-organo-heterotrophic|chemoorganotrophic]]'' since they use organic carbon as both an electron donor and carbon source. [[Eukaryote]]s are generally easy to categorise. All animals are ''heterotrophic'', as are fungi. Plants are generally ''photoautotrophic''. Some eukaryotic microorganisms, however, are not limited to just one nutritional mode. For example, some algae live photoautotrophically in the light, but shift to chemoorganotrophy in the dark. Even higher plants retained their ability to respire heterotrophically on the starch at night which had been synthesised phototrophically during the day.

[[Prokaryote]]s show a great diversity of nutritional categories. For example, [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]] are generally photoautotrophic whereas [[purple non-sulfur bacteria]] are photoorganotrophic. Some bacteria are limited to only one nutritional group, whereas others are [[facultative]] and switch from one mode to the other, depending on the nutrient sources available.

RMIT's '''School of Business IT and Logistics''' (also referred to as SBITL) is an [[Australian]] [[tertiary education]] school within the College of Business at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ([[RMIT University]]), located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=business_portfolio&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/schools&amp;groups RMIT Business Schools and Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SBITL has been a part of RMIT for more than 20 years. The Master of Business (IT) program has been delivered in Singapore for 20 years and it is likely that it has been delivered for more than that at their campus in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=MBIT_birthday&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/bit/mbit_birthday; RMIT’s MBIT SIM alumni contemplate “Brain Conditioning”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Clubs==
The school recognises two [[Student society|student societies]] falling under its academics. The [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-business-information-systems-student-association-bissa/ Business Information Systems Students Association] serves as the academic society for the [[information system]]s students, and the [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-supply-chain-student-association/ Supply Chain Student Association] serves the [[logistics]] &amp; [[Supply chain|supply chain management]] students. Both societies are affiliates of the [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-business-student-association-bsa-rmit/ RMIT Business Student Association].

==Location==
SBITL is located in building 80.

==Programs==
SBITL offers programs from [[undergraduate]] to doctor levels, most of the programs are delivered at the [[RMIT University]] City Campus. Some of the programs are delivered at the [[RMIT International University, Vietnam|RMIT University International Campus Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Programs&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=i7l61p4f90ay;STATUS=A;PAGE_AUTHOR=Minh%20Vu;SECTION=1; RMIT University School of Business Information Technology Academic Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry links==
SBITL has strong links to the industry with partners including [[IBM|IBM Australia]], [[GS1|GS1 Australia]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]]. Partners contribute differently. Examples include guest lectures from Ernst &amp; Young and IBM Australia for research and education purposes. SBIT also have relationships with other professional associations such as [[Association for Information Systems|AIS]], [[Australian Computer Society|ACS]] and [[ALIA]].&lt;ref name=Industry_links&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/bit/industry; SBIT Industry Links]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927220919/http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&amp;nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&amp;Delta;h]]=3.3*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s*10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*135&amp;nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.
&lt;!--
These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

"14*3300 bars m^3/sec" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~
--&gt;

==Development==
In 2006 a 50&amp;nbsp;kW plant was located at a coastal test site in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/book/export/html/2243 Blue energy]&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being on prevention of [[biofouling]] of the [[anode]], [[cathode]], and membranes and increasing the membrane performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbk.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/JMembrSciVeerman/2008JMembrSciVeerman.pdf electrodialysis stacks by a validated model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netserver2.net/waterforum/index.asp?url=/template_a1.asp&amp;que=paginanr=3716 Friese wereldprimeur met stroomproductie uit zoet-zout water]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Directorate for Public Works and Water Management, Redstack, and ENECO signed a declaration of intent for development of a pilot plant on the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporateuk.eneco.nl/pages/default.asp?PageID=60&amp;Mainmenu=News%20and%20media&amp;MainmenuID=45&amp;Mainmenusub=Press%20releases&amp;MainmenusubID=60&amp;ShowNieuws=13424&amp;ModuleitemID=424 Electricity from fresh and salt water]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was put into service on 26 November 2014 and produces 50 kW of electricity to show the technical feasibility in real-life conditions using fresh IJsselmeer water and salt water from the Wadden Sea. Theoretically, with 1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s river water and an equal amount of sea water, approximately 1 MW of renewable electricity can be recovered at this location by upscaling the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch King opens world's first RED power plant driven on fresh-salt water mixing|url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|publisher=Dutch Water Sector|accessdate=4 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092205/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be expected that after this phase the installation could be further expanded to a final capacity of 200 MW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">In [[applied mathematics]], the two-dimensional '''Spectral [[signal-to-noise ratio]]''' (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency {{harv|Unser|1987}}. It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the [[Fourier shell correlation]]. The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in [[cryo-electron microscopy]].

== Calculation ==

:&lt;math&gt;
SSNR (r)
 = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R}\sum_{k_i}{ \left|{ F_{r_i,k} - \bar{F}_{r_i}}\right|^2}} -1
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
:&lt;math&gt;
 =
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R} 
\left| \sum_{k_i}F^2_{r_i,k} - \frac{1}{K}\left(\sum_{k_i}F_{r_i,k}\right)^2 \right|}
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_{r_i,k}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for image k for a pixel &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible convert the SSNR into an equivalent FRC using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
FRC = \frac{SSNR}{SSNR + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">[[File:Syntax error.JPG|thumb|Syntax error in a scientific calculator]]
In [[computer science]], a '''syntax error''' is an error in the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of a sequence of characters or [[Token (parser)|tokens]] that is intended to be written in a particular [[programming language]].

For [[compiled language]]s, syntax errors are detected at [[compiler|compile-time]]. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected. For [[interpreted language]]s, however, a syntax error may be detected during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|program execution]], and an interpreter's error messages might not differentiate syntax errors from errors of other kinds.

There is some disagreement as to just what errors are "syntax errors". For example, some would say that the use of an uninitialized variable's value in Java code is a syntax error, but many others would disagree&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8803718/issue-of-syntax-or-semantics/8803765#8803765 Issue of syntax or semantics?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uninitialized var" /&gt; and would classify this as a [[Programming language#Static semantics|(static) semantic]] error.

In 8-bit [[home computer]]s that used [[BASIC]] interpreter as their primary user interface, the &lt;tt&gt;SYNTAX ERROR&lt;/tt&gt; [[error message]] became somewhat notorious, as this was the response to any command or user input the interpreter could not parse.

A syntax error may also occur when an invalid equation is entered into a [[calculator]]. This can be caused, for instance, by opening brackets without closing them, or less commonly, entering several [[decimal point]]s in one number.

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]] the following is a syntactically correct statement:
:&lt;source lang="java"&gt;System.out.println("Hello World");&lt;/source&gt;

while the following is not:
:&lt;pre&gt;System.out.println(Hello World);&lt;/pre&gt;

The second example would theoretically print the variable Hello World instead of the words Hello World. However, a variable in Java cannot have a space in between, so the syntactically correct line would be System.out.println(Hello_World).

A compiler will flag a syntax error when given source code that does not meet the requirements of the language grammar.

Type errors (such as an attempt to apply the ++ increment operator to a boolean variable in Java) and undeclared variable errors are sometimes considered to be syntax errors when they are detected at compile-time. However, it is common to classify such errors as [[Programming language#Static semantics|(static) semantic]] errors instead.&lt;ref name="uninitialized var"&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/semantic-errors-in-java.html Semantic Errors in Java]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aho|first=Alfred V.|author2=Monica S.

[[File:Aqua Tower thermal imaging.jpg|thumb|This thermal image shows a thermal bridging of a high-rise building ([[Aqua (skyscraper)|Aqua]] in [[Chicago]])]]A '''thermal bridge''', also called a '''cold bridge''', '''heat bridge''', or '''thermal bypass''', is an area or component of an object which has higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the surrounding materials,&lt;ref name="Binggeli"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Systems for Interior Designers|last=Binggeli|first=C.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a path of least resistance for [[heat transfer]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston (2012). "Thermal bridge", in ''Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying, and Civil Engineering''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2012 pp. 440-441. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridges result in an overall reduction in [[thermal resistance]] of the object. The term is frequently discussed in the context of a building's [[thermal envelope]] where thermal bridges result in heat transfer into or out of conditioned space.

Thermal bridges in buildings may impact the amount of energy required to heat and cool a space, cause condensation (moisture) within the building envelope,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65147.pdf|title=Construction Guidelines for High R-Value Walls without Exterior Rigid Insulation|last=Arena|first=Lois|date=July 2016|year=2016|website=NREL.gov|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)|format=PDF|publication-place=Golden, CO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and result in thermal discomfort. In colder climates (such as The United Kingdom), thermal heat bridges can result in additional heat losses and require additional energy to mitigate.

There are strategies to reduce or prevent thermal bridging, such as limiting the number of building members that span from unconditioned to conditioned space and applying continuous insulation materials to create [[thermal break]]s.


==Concept==
[[File:Jonction plancher haut-mur extérieur 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal bridge at junction. Heat moves from the floor structure through the wall because there is no thermal break.]]
Heat transfer occurs through three mechanisms: [[convection]], [[Thermal radiation|radiation]], and [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Heat Transfer: Principles, Materials, and Applications|last=Kaviany|first=Massoud|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=1107012406|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thermal bridge is an example of heat transfer through conduction. The rate of heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the material and the temperature difference experienced on either side of the thermal bridge. When a temperature difference is present, heat flow will follow the path of least resistance through the material with the highest thermal conductivity and lowest thermal resistance; this path is a thermal bridge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://passipedia.org/basics/building_physics_-_basics/thermal_bridges/thermal_bridge_definition|title=Definition and effects of thermal bridges [  ]|website=passipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridging describes a situation in a building where there is a direct connection between the outside and inside through one or more elements that possess a higher thermal conductivity than the rest of the envelope of the building. 

==Identifying Thermal Bridges==
Surveying buildings for thermal bridges is performed using passive [[infrared thermography]] (IRT) according to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Infrared Thermography of buildings can allow thermal signatures that indicate heat leaks. IRT detects thermal abnormalities that are linked to the movement of fluids through building elements, highlighting the variations in the thermal properties of the materials that correspondingly cause a major change in temperature. The drop shadow effect, a situation in which the surrounding environment casts a shadow on the facade of the building, can lead to potential accuracy issues of measurements through inconsistent facade sun exposure. An alternative analysis method, Iterative Filtering (IF), can be used to solve this problem.

In all thermographic building inspections, the thermal image interpretation if performed by a human operator, involving a high level of subjectivity and expertise of the operator. Automated analysis approaches, such as [[Laser scanning]] technologies can provide thermal imaging on 3 dimensional [[CAD]] model surfaces and metric information to thermographic analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Previtali |first1=Mattia |last2=Barazzetti |first2=Luigi |last3=Roncoroni |first3=Fabio |title=Spatial Data Management for Energy Efficient Envelope Retrofitting |journal=Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2013 |date=24-27 June 2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39637-3_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface temperature data in 3D models can identify and measure thermal irregularities of thermal bridges and insulation leaks. Thermal imaging can also be acquired through the use of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAV), fusing thermal data from multiple cameras and platforms. The UAV uses an infrared camera to generate a thermal field image of recorded temperature values, where every pixel represents radiative energy emitted by the surface of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrido |first1=I. |last2=Lagüela |first2=S. |last3=Arias |first3=P. |last4=Balado |first4=J. |title=Thermal-based analysis for the automatic detection and characterization of thermal bridges in buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings |date=1 January 2018 |volume=158 |pages=1358-1367 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.11.031 |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Thermal Bridging in Construction==
Frequently, thermal bridging is used in reference to a building’s thermal envelope, which is a layer of the building enclosure system that resists heat flow between the interior conditioned environment and the exterior unconditioned environment. Heat will transfer through a building’s thermal envelope at different rates depending on the materials present throughout the envelope. Heat transfer will be greater at thermal bridge locations than where insulation exists because there is less thermal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-0901-thermal-metrics-high-performance-walls-limitations-r-value/view|title=RR-0901: Thermal Metrics for High-Performance Walls—The Limitations of R-Value|work=Building Science Corporation|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, when exterior temperature is typically lower than interior temperature, heat flows outward and will flow at greater rates through thermal bridges. At a thermal bridge location, the surface temperature on the inside of the building envelope will be lower than the surrounding area. In the summer, when the exterior temperature is typically higher than the interior temperature, heat flows inward, and at greater rates through thermal bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings|last=Grondzik|first=Walter|last2=Kwok|first2=Alison|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=0470195657|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes winter heat losses and summer heat gains for conditioned spaces in buildings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larbi|first=A. Ben|title=Statistical modelling of heat transfer for thermal bridges of buildings|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=37|issue=9|pages=945–951|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite insulation requirements specified by various national regulations, thermal bridging in a building's envelope remain a weak spot in the construction industry. Moreover, in many countries building design practices implement partial insulation measurements foreseen by regulations.&lt;ref&gt;THEODOSIOU, T. G, and A. M PAPADOPOULOS. 2008. “The Impact of Thermal Bridges on the Energy Demand of Buildings with Double Brick Wall Constructions.” Energy and Buildings, no. 11: 2083. https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedscal%26AN%3dedscal.20659411%26site%3deds-live.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermal losses are greater in practice that is anticipated during the design stage.

An assembly such as an exterior wall or insulated ceiling is generally classified by a [[R-value (insulation)|U-factor]], in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·K, that reflects the overall rate of heat transfer per unit area for all the materials within an assembly, not just the insulation layer. Heat transfer via thermal bridges reduces the overall thermal resistance of an assembly, resulting in an increased U-factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=2016-09-16|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/109719639702000306|journal=Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=249–268|doi=10.1177/109719639702000306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal bridges can occur at several locations within a building envelope; most commonly, they occur at junctions between two or more building elements. Common locations include:
*Floor-to-wall or balcony-to-wall junctions, including slab-on-grade and [[concrete]] balconies or outdoor patios that extend the [[floor slab]] through the building envelope
*Roof/Ceiling-to-wall junctions, especially where full ceiling insulation depths may not be achieved
*Window-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Jeffery|last2=Kosny|first2=Jan|date=December 1995|title=Toward a National Opaque Wall Rating Label|url=|journal=Proceedings Thermal Performance of the Exterior Envelopes VI, ASHRAE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Door-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Wall-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Wood, steel or concrete members, such as studs and joists, incorporated in exterior wall, ceiling, or roof construction&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, E. and J. Lano, ''Fundamentals of Building Construction: materials and methods''. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recessed luminaries that penetrate insulated ceilings
*Windows and doors, especially frames components
*Areas with gaps in or poorly installed insulation
*Metal ties in masonry cavity walls&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;

Structural elements remain a weak point in construction, commonly leading to thermal bridges that result in high heat loss and low surface temperatues in a room.

===Masonry Buildings===
While thermal bridges exist in various types of building enclosures, [[Masonry|masonry walls]] experience significantly increased U-factors caused by thermal bridges. Comparing [[list of thermal conductivities|thermal conductivities]] between different building materials allows for assessment of performance relative to other design options. Brick materials, which are usually used for facade enclosures, typically have higher thermal conductivities than timber, depending on the brick density and wood type.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=2017 ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|last=American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE)|first=|publisher=ASHRAE|year=2017|isbn=1939200571|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete, which may be used for floors and edge beams in masonry buildings are common thermal bridges, especially at the corners. Depending on the physical makeup of the concrete, the thermal conductivity can be greater than that of brick materials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition to heat transfer, if the indoor environment is not adequately vented, thermal bridging may cause the brick material to absorb rainwater and humidity into the wall, which can result in mold growth and deterioration of building envelope material.

===Curtain Wall===
Similar to masonry walls, [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] can experience significantly increases U-factors due to thermal bridging. Curtain wall frames are often constructed with highly conductive aluminum, which has a typical thermal conductivity above 200 W/m·K. In comparison, wood framing members are typically between 0.68 and 1.25 W/m·K.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The aluminum frame for most curtain wall constructions extends from the exterior of the building through to the interior, creating thermal bridges.&lt;ref name="Totten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Totten|first=Paul E.|last2=O’Brien|first2=Sean M.|date=2008|title=The Effects of Thermal Bridging at Interface Conditions|journal=Building Enclosure Science &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts of Thermal Bridging ===
Thermal bridging can result in increased energy required to heat or cool a conditioned space due to winter heat loss and summer heat gain. At interior locations near thermal bridges, occupants may experience thermal discomfort due to the difference in temperature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ge|first=Hua|last2=McClung|first2=Victoria Ruth|last3=Zhang|first3=Shenshu|title=Impact of balcony thermal bridges on the overall thermal performance of multi-unit residential buildings: A case study|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=60|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor space is large and there is warm and humid air indoors, such as the conditions experienced in the winter, there is a risk of condensation in the building envelope due to the cooler temperature on the interior surface at thermal bridge locations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Condensation can ultimately result in mold growth with consequent poor indoor air quality and insulation degradation, reducing the insulation performance and causing insulation to perform inconsistently throughout the thermal envelope&lt;ref name="Miimu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matilainen|first=Miimu|last2=Jarek|first2=Kurnitski|date=2002|title=Moisture conditions in highly insulated outdoor ventilated crawl spaces in cold climates|journal=Energy and buildings|volume=35|issue=2|pages=175–187|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design Methods to Reduce Thermal Bridges==
There are several methods that have been proven to reduce or eliminate thermal bridging depending on the cause, location, and the construction type. The objective of these methods is to either create a [[thermal break]] where a building component would span from exterior to interior otherwise, or to reduce the number of building components spanning from exterior to interior. These strategies include:

*A continuous thermal [[building insulation|insulation]] layer in the thermal envelope, such as with rigid foam board insulation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Lapping of insulation where direct continuity is not possible
*Double and staggered wall assemblies&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Residential Compliance Manual for the 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards|last=California Energy Commission (CEC)|first=|publisher=California Energy Commission|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) and [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Reducing framing factor by eliminating unnecessary framing members, such as implemented with advanced framing&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Raised heel trusses at wall-to-roof junctions to increase insulation depth
*Quality insulation installation without voids or compressed insulation
*Installing double or triple pane windows with gas filler and low-emissivity coating&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustavsen|first=Arild|last2=Grynning|first2=Steinar|last3=Arasteh|first3=Dariush|last4=Jelle|first4=Bjørn Petter|last5=Goudey|first5=Howdy|title=Key elements of and material performance targets for highly insulating window frames|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=10|pages=2583–2594|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis Methods and Challenges==
Due to their significant impacts on heat transfer, correctly modeling the impacts of thermal bridges is important to estimate overall energy use. Thermal bridges are characterized by multi-dimensional heat transfer, and therefore they cannot be adequately approximated by steady-state one-dimensional (1D) models of calculation typically used to estimate the thermal performance of buildings in most building energy simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=K.|last2=Erkoreka|first2=A.|last3=Flores|first3=I.|last4=Odriozola|first4=M.|last5=Sala|first5=J.M.|title=Problems in the calculation of thermal bridges in dynamic conditions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=2-3|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady state heat transfer models are based on simple heat flow where heat is driven by a temperature difference that does not fluctuate over time so that heat flow is always in one direction. This type of 1D model can substantially underestimate heat transfer through the envelope when thermal bridges are present, resulting in lower predicted building energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Guofeng|last2=Johanneson|first2=Gudni|date=1997|title=Dynamic Calculation of Thermal Bridges|url=|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=26|pages=233–240|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently available solutions are to enable two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer capabilities in modeling software or, more commonly, to use a method that translates multi-dimensional heat transfer into an equivalent 1D component to use in building simulation software. This latter method can be accomplished through the equivalent wall method in which a complex dynamic assembly, such as a wall with a thermal bridge, is represented by a 1D multi-layered assembly that has equivalent thermal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=January 1997|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=|journal=J.

'''Trait leadership''' is defined as integrated patterns of personal characteristics that reflect a range of individual differences and foster consistent leader effectiveness across a variety of group and organizational situations (Zaccaro, Kemp, &amp; Bader, 2004).&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Zaccaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen J. Zaccaro|first1=George Mason University|title=Trait-Based Perspectives of Leadership|date=January 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/nwphli/2006/docs/Trait_based_perspectives_of_leadership-2.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of trait leadership is developed from early leadership research which focused primarily on finding a group of heritable attributes that differentiate leaders from nonleaders. [https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=ojwed Leader effectiveness] refers to the amount of influence a leader has on individual or group performance, followers’ satisfaction, and overall effectiveness (Derue, Nahrgang, Wellman, &amp; Humphrey, 2011). &lt;ref name="The Leadership Quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Leadership Quarterly|title=Personality predictors of leadership styles and the self–other agreement problem|date=13 March 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reinout_De_Vries/publication/229316315_Personality_predictors_of_leadership_styles_and_the_self-other/links/0fcfd50f9718514c46000000/Personality-predictors-of-leadership-styles-and-the-self-other.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have argued that leadership is unique to only a select number of individuals and that these individuals possess certain immutable traits that cannot be developed (Galton, 1869). Although this perspective has been criticized immensely over the past century, scholars still continue to study the effects of personality traits on leader effectiveness. Research has demonstrated that successful leaders differ from other people and possess certain core personality traits that significantly contribute to their success. Understanding the importance of these core personality traits that predict leader effectiveness can help organizations with their leader selection, training, and development practices (Derue et al., 2011).

== History of research ==
The emergence of the concept of trait leadership can be traced back to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s [[Great Man theory|"great man" theory]], which stated that "The History of the World [...] was the Biography of Great Men."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent commentators interpreted this view to conclude that the forces of extraordinary leadership&lt;ref&gt;
Carlyle in [[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History|''On Heroes'']] did not use the word "leadership" in his discussion of the hero as divinity, as prophet, as poet, as priest, as man of letters, and as "king" ; he mentions "leader" and "leaders" only 6 times (once quite disparagingly) in that work.

shape history (Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Kosalka, 2009). Influenced by Carlyle, [[Francis Galton]] in ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) took this idea further. Galton found that leadership was a unique property of extraordinary individuals and suggested that the traits which leaders possessed were immutable and could not be developed. Throughout the early 1900s, the study of leadership focused on traits.  Cowley (1931) commented that the approach to the research of leadership has usually been and should always be through the study of traits (Cowley, 1931). Many theorists, influenced by Carlyle and Galton, believed that trait leadership depended on the personal qualities of the leader, however, they did not assume that leadership only resides within a select number of people (Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002). This trait perspective of leadership was widely accepted until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when researchers began to deem personality traits insufficient in predicting leader effectiveness (Stogdill, 1948; Mann, 1959).

In 1948, Stogdill stated that leadership exists between persons in a social situation, and that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. This statement has been cited ubiquitously as sounding the death knell for trait-leadership theory. Furthermore, scholars commented that any trait's effect on leadership behavior will always depend on the situation (Huges, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy, 1996; Yukl &amp; Van Fleet, 1992).  Subsequently, leadership stopped being characterized by individual differences, and behavioral and situational analyses of leadership took over and began to dominate the field of leadership research (Bass, 1990). During this period of widespread rejection, several dominant theories took the place of trait leadership theory, including Fiedler's (1967) contingency model, Blake and Mouton's (1964) managerial grid, Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model, and transformational and transactional leadership models (Avolio, Sosik, Jung, &amp; Berson, 2003; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, &amp; Fetter, 1990).

Despite the growing criticisms of trait leadership, the purported basis for the rejection of trait-leadership models began to encounter strong challenges (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983; Lord, DeVader, &amp; Alliger, 1986) in the 1980s. Zaccaro (2007) pointed out that even Stogdill's (1948) review, although cited as evidence against leader traits, contained conclusions supporting that individual differences could still be predictors of leader effectiveness. With an increasing number of empirical studies directly supporting trait leadership (Judge et al., 2002; Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004), traits have reemerged in the lexicon of the scientific research into leadership. In recent years, the research about leader traits has made some progress in identifying a list of personality traits that are highly predictive of leader effectiveness. Additionally, to account for the arguments for situational leadership, researchers have used the [[round-robin design methodology]] to test whether certain individuals emerge as leaders across multiple situations (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983). Scholars have also proposed new ways of studying the relationship of certain traits to leader effectiveness. For instance, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} suggest the integration of trait and behavioral theories to understand how traits relate to leader effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). Furthermore, scholars have expanded their focus and have proposed looking at more malleable traits (ones susceptible to development) in addition to the traditional dispositional traits as predictors of leader effectiveness (Hoffman, Woehr, Maldagen-Youngjohn, &amp; Lyons, 2011). Context is only now beginning to be examined as a contributor to leaders' success and failure. [[Productive narcissism|Productive narcissistic]] CEOs like [[Steven Jobs]] of Apple and [[Jack Welch]] of GE have demonstrated a gift for creating [[innovation]], whereas leaders with idealized traits prove more successful in more stable environments requiring less innovation and [[creativity]] (Maccoby, 2007).

Cultural fit and leadership value can be determined by evaluating an individual’s own behavior, perceptions of their employees and peers, and the direct objective results of their organization, and then comparing these findings against the needs of the company (Bass, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah,  NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leader traits ==
The investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007). In recent years, several studies have made comprehensive reviews about leader traits which have been historically studied (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). There are many ways that traits related to leadership can be categorized; however, the two most recent categorizations have organized traits into (1) demographic vs. task competence vs. interpersonal and (2) distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like): 

=== Demographic, task competence and interpersonal leadership ===
Based on a recent review of the trait leadership literature, Derue and others (2011) stated that most leader traits can be organized into three categories: demographic, task competence, and interpersonal attributes. For the demographics category, gender has by far received the most attention in terms of leadership; however, most scholars have found that male and female leaders are both equally effective. Task competence relates to how individuals approach the execution and performance of tasks (Bass &amp; Bass, 2008). Hoffman grouped intelligence, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Emotional Stability into this category. Lastly, interpersonal attributes are related to how a leader approaches social interactions. According to Hoffman and others (2011), Extraversion and Agreeableness should be grouped into this category.

=== Distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like) ===
Recent research has shifted from focusing solely on distal (dispositional/trait-like) characteristics of leaders to more proximal (malleable/state-like) individual differences often in the form of knowledge and skills (Hoffman et al., 2011). The hope is that emergence of proximal traits in trait leadership theory will help researchers answer the ancient question: are leaders born or made?  Proximal individual differences suggest that the characteristics that distinguish effective leaders from non-effective leaders are not necessarily stable through the life-span, implying that these traits may be able to be developed. Hoffman and others (2011) examined the effects of distal vs. proximal traits on leader effectiveness. He found that distal individual differences of achievement motivation, energy, flexibility, dominance, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, creativity, and charisma were strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. Additionally, he found that the proximal individual differences of interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication, management skills, problem solving skills, and decision making were also strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. His results suggested that on average, distal and proximal individual differences have a similar relationship with effective leadership (Hoffman et al., 2011).

== Trait-leadership model ==
Zaccaro and colleagues (2004) created a model to understand leader traits and their influence on leader effectiveness/performance. This model, shown in the figure below, is based on other models of leader traits and leader effectiveness/performance (Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, Fleishman, &amp; Reiter-Palmon, 1993; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000) and rests on two basic premises about leader traits. The first premise is that leadership emerges from the combined influence of multiple traits as opposed to emerging from the independent assessment of traits. Zaccaro (2001) argued that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other. The second premise is that leader traits differ in their proximal influence on leadership. This model is a multistage one in which certain distal attributes (i.e. dispositional attributes, cognitive abilities, and motives/values) serve as precursors for the development of proximal personal characteristics (i.e. social skills, problem solving skills and expertise knowledge) (Ackerman &amp; Humphreys, 1990; Barrick, Mitchell, &amp; Stewart, 2003; Chen, Gully, Whiteman, &amp; Kilcullen, 2000; Schneider, Hough, &amp; Dunnette, 1996; Kanfer, 1990, 1992; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000). Adopting this categorization approach and based on several comprehensive reviews/meta-analysis of trait leadership in recent years (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007), we tried to make an inclusive list of leader traits (Table 1). However, the investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007).

'''Table 1. Leader Traits based on Zaccaro’s (2004) Model'''
|-
| [[Extraversion]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal. In Judge and other’s (2002) [[meta-analysis]], Extraversion was significantly positively related to leadership ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] = .31).
|-
| [[Agreeableness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; refers to the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. The relationship between Agreeableness and leadership is still ambiguous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Agreeableness was not significantly related to leadership (r = .08).
|-
| [[Conscientiousness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; it comprises two related facets, namely achievement and dependability. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Conscientiousness was significantly positively related to leadership (r = .28).
|-
| [[Openness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Openness was found to be significantly positively related with leadership (r = .24).
|-
| [[Neuroticism]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects, such as anxiety, insecurity, and hostility. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Neuroticism was significantly negatively correlated with (r = -.24).
|-
| [[Honesty]]/[[integrity]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Defined as the correspondence between work and deed, and as being truthful and non deceitful (Locke, 1991). In Hoffman and other’s (2011) meta analysis, honesty/integrity was found to be positively related to leadership effectiveness of others and surrounding factors(r = .29).
|-
| [[Charisma]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Charismatic leaders are able to influence followers by articulating a compelling vision for the future, arousing commitment to organizational objectives and inspiring commitment and a sense of self-efficacy among followers. Hoffman and others (2011) found it has a significant influence on leadership (r = .57).
|-
| [[Intelligence]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Intelligence is regarded as the most important trait in psychology. It has been identified as one of the most critical traits that must be possessed by all leaders (Judge et al., 2004).
|-
| [[Creativity]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Creativity has been proposed as an important component of effective leadership; Hoffman and others (2011) found a significant relationship between creativity and leader effectiveness (r = .31).
|-
| Achievement motivation (Distal - Motive/Value)|| The motivation to achieve has been proved to have significant relationship with leader effectiveness (r = .23) (Judge et al., 2002).
|-
| [[Need for power]](Distal - Motive/Value)|| Characterized by the satisfaction leaders derive from exerting influence over the attitudes and behaviors of others. Need for power has a positive relationship with leader effectiveness (McClelland &amp; Boyatzis, 1982).
|-
| Oral/written communication (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Oral and written communication skills are found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Interpersonal skills]] (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Including a broad range of skills associated with un understanding of human behavior and the dynamics of groups (Locke, 1991; Yukl, 2006), interpersonal skills were found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| General [[problem solving]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| General problem solving skills were found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Decision making]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| Decision skills were also found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| Technical knowledge (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Technical knowledge includes methods, processes, and equipment for conducting the specialized activities of the managers’ organizational unit (Yukl, 2006). It has been proved to be positively correlated with leader effectiveness (Bass, 1990).
|-
| [[Management]] skills (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Given that leaders’ key responsibilities involve coordinating the work of multiple constituents, the ability to manage is likely crucial to leader effectiveness. This relationship has also been proved significant (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|}

== Other models of trait leadership ==
Multiple models have been proposed to explain the relationship of traits to leader effectiveness.  Recently, integrated trait leadership models were put forward by summarizing the historical findings and reconciling the conflict between traits and other factors such as situations in determining effective leadership (Derue et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). In addition to Zaccaro’s Model of Leader Attributes and Leader Performance described in the previous section, two other models have emerged in recent trait leadership literature. The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) Model, created by Judge and colleagues (2009), combines the behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology theories of how personality traits are developed into a model that explains leader emergence and effectiveness. Additionally, this model separates objective and subjective leader effectiveness into different criterion. The authors created this model to be broad and flexible as to diverge from how the relationship between traits and leadership had been studied in past research. Another model that has emerged in the trait leadership literature is the Integrated Model of Leader Traits, Behaviors, and Effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). This model combines traits and behaviors in predicting leader effectiveness and tested the mediation effect of leader behaviors on the relationship between leader traits and effectiveness. The authors found that some types of leader behaviors mediated the effect between traits and leader effectiveness. The results of Derue and colleagues' (2011) study supported an integrated trait-behavioral model that can be used in future research.

== Criticisms of trait leadership ==
Although there has been an increased focus by researchers on trait leadership, this theory remains one of the most criticized theories of leadership. Over the years, many reviewers of trait leadership theory have commented that this approach to leadership is “too simplistic” (Conger &amp; Kanugo, 1998), and “futile” (House &amp; Aditya, 1997). Additionally, scholars have noted that trait leadership theory usually only focuses on how leader effectiveness is perceived by followers (Lord et al., 1986) rather than a leader’s actual effectiveness (Judge et al., 2009). Because the process through which personality predicts the actual effectiveness of leaders has been relatively unexplored (Ng, Ang, &amp; Chan, 2008), these scholars have concluded that personality currently has low explanatory and predictive power over job performance and cannot help organizations select leaders who will be effective (Morgeson &amp; Ilies, 2007). Furthermore, Derue and colleagues (2011) found that leader behaviors are more predictive of leader effectiveness than are traits.

Another criticism of trait leadership is its silence on the influence of the situational context surrounding leaders (Ng et al., 2008). Stogdill (1948) found that persons who are leaders in one situation may not be leaders in another situation. Complimenting this situational theory of leadership, Murphy (1941) wrote that leadership does not reside in the person, and it usually requires examining the whole situation. In addition to situational leadership theory, there has been growing support for other leadership theories such as transformational, transactional, charismatic, and authentic leadership theories. These theories have gained popularity because they are more normative than the trait and behavioral leadership theories (Schaubroeck, Lam, &amp; Cha, 2007).

Further criticisms include the failure of studies to uncover a trait or group of traits that are consistently associated with leadership emergence or help differentiate leaders from followers (Kenny &amp; Zacarro, 1983). Additionally, trait leadership’s focus on a small set of personality traits and neglect of more malleable traits such as social skills and problem solving skills has received considerable criticism.  Lastly, trait leadership often fails to consider the integration of multiple traits when studying the effects of traits on leader effectiveness (Zaccaro, 2007).

== Implications for practice ==
Given the recent increase in evidence and support of trait leadership theory (Ng et al., 2008), scholars have suggested a variety of strategies for human resource departments within organizations.  Companies should use personality traits as selection tools for identifying emerging leaders (Ng et al., 2008). These companies, however, should be aware of the individual traits that predict success in leader effectiveness as well as the traits that could be detrimental to leader effectiveness. For example, while Derue and colleagues (2011) found that individuals who are high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness are predicted to be more likely to be perceived as successful in leadership positions, Judge, Woolf, Hurst, &amp; Livingston (2006) wrote that individuals who are high in narcissism are more likely to be a liability in certain jobs. Narcissism is just one example of a personality trait that should be explored further by HR practitioners to ensure they are not placing individuals with certain traits in the wrong positions.

Complementing the suggestion that personality traits should be used as selection tools, Judge and colleagues (2002) found that the Big Five Personality traits were more strongly related to leadership than intelligence. This finding suggests that selecting leaders based on their personality is more important than selecting them based on intelligence. If organizations select leaders based on intelligence, it is recommended by Judge and colleagues (2002) that these individuals be placed in leadership positions when the stress level is low and the individual has the ability to be directive.

Another way in which HR practitioners can use the research on trait leadership is for leadership development programs. Although inherent personality traits (distal/trait-like) are relatively immune to leadership development, Zaccaro (2007) suggested that proximal traits (state-like) will be more malleable and susceptible to leadership development programs. Companies should use different types of development interventions to stretch the existing capabilities of their leaders (Zaccaro, 2007).

There is also evidence to suggest that Americans have an Extrovert Ideal, which dictates that people, most times unconsciously, favor the traits of extroverted individuals and suppress the qualities unique to introverts (Cain, 2012). Susan Cain's research points to a transition sometime around the turn of the century during which we stopped evaluating our leaders based on character and began judging them instead based on personality. While both extroverted and introverted leaders have been shown to be effective, we have a general proclivity towards extroverted traits, which when evaluating trait leadership, could skew our perception of what's important.
