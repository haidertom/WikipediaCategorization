[[File:Adrian-Ross-1904.jpg|thumb|right|Ross in 1904]]
'''Arthur Reed Ropes''' (23 December 1859 – 11 September 1933), better known under the pseudonym '''Adrian Ross''', was a prolific writer of lyrics, contributing songs to more than sixty British [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was the most important lyricist of the British stage during a career that spanned five decades.  At a time when few shows had long runs, nineteen of his [[West End theatre|West End]] shows ran for over 400 performances.

Starting out in the late 1880s, Ross wrote the lyrics for the earliest British musical theatre hits, including ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894) and ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896).  Ross next wrote the lyrics for a string of hit musicals, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900) and ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901) and continuing without a break through [[World War I]].  He also wrote the English lyrics for a series of hit adaptations of European operettas beginning with ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in 1907.

During World War I, Ross was one of the founders of the [[Performing Rights Society]].  He continued writing until 1930, producing several more successes after the war.  He also wrote the popular novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories.

==Life and career==
Ross was born in [[Lewisham]], London.  He was the youngest son and fourth child of Ellen Harriet Ropes née Hall, of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and William Hooper Ropes, a Russia merchant.  Ross's parents lived in [[Normandy]], France, but sent him to school in London at Priory House School in [[Clapton, London|Clapton]], [[Mill Hill School]], and the [[City of London School]].  He later attended [[King's College, Cambridge]], where, in 1881, he won the Chancellor's Medal for English verse for his poem "Temple Bar", and also won the Members' Prize for the English essay.  In 1883 he graduated with a first-class degree, winning the Lightfoot scholarship for history and a Whewell scholarship for international law.  He was elected a fellow of the College.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=RPS878AR|name=Ropes, Arthur Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Parker, J., rev. Katharine Chubbuck. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35826 "Ropes, Arthur Reed (1859–1933)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Cambridge University]] graduate and [[academia|don]], teaching history and poetry from 1884 to 1890 and writing serious and comic verse of his own, the first volume of which was published in 1884. In 1889, he published "A Sketch of the History of Europe". He was also a translator of French and German literature under his own name.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He created the fictitious name "Adrian Ross" due to a concern that writing musicals would compromise his academic career.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who7c.htm "Who's Who in Musicals: Ross, Adrian"], Musicals101.com: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[Image:Moroccobound1.jpg|left|thumb|A. C. Seymour and [[Letty Lind]] in ''[[Morocco Bound]]'']]
During a brief illness in 1883 after catching cold at the University Boat Race, Ross used the lonely time in bed to write the libretto of an entertainment entitled ''A Double Event''. This was produced at [[St. George's Hall, London]] in 1884 with music by [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], and Ross used the name "Arthur Reed". His next work for the stage, also as Arthur Reed, was the book and lyrics for a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], ''Faddimir'' (1889 at the [[Opera Comique]]), with music by fellow Cambridge graduate, [[F. Osmond Carr]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The piece earned enough praise so that the impresario [[George Edwardes]] commissioned the two to write another burlesque, together with the comic actor John Lloyd Shine, called ''Joan of Arc''.  Songs from the piece included "I Went to Find Emin", "Round the Town", and "Jack the Dandy-O".  ''Joan of Arc'' opened in 1891 at the Opera Comique starring [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[Marion Hood]]; he wrote under the pseudonym Adrian Ross, which he used for the rest of his career. The piece was a hit, lasting for almost eight hundred performances, and Ross resigned from Cambridge.  To supplement his income from theatre writing, Ross became a contributor to such journals as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''Sketch'', ''Sphere'' and ''The World'', and he joined the staff of ''Ariel'' in 1891–1892.  He wrote in ''[[Tatler (1901)|The Tatler]]'' under the pseudonym Bran Pie and in 1893 published an edition of [[Lady Mary Wortley Montague]]'s Letters. He also published numerous French texts for the Pitt Press series.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Ross and Carr's next work, in collaboration with [[James T. Tanner]], was ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), a smart, contemporary tale of backstage and society goings-on.  This left behind the earlier Gaiety burlesques and helped set the new fashion for the series of modern-dress [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] shows that quickly spread to other theatres and dominated British musical theatre.  For his next piece, ''[[Morocco Bound]]'' (1893, with the song "Marguerite from Monte Carlo"), Ross concentrated on writing lyrics, leaving the "book" mostly to Arthur Branscombe.  This proved to be his most successful model through most of his career.&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/british/authors/ross.html "Adrian Ross" profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906072755/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/ross.html |date=6 September 2006 }} at the British Musical Theatre site of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 7 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The position of "lyricist" was relatively new, as previously the writers of libretti would invariably write the lyrics themselves.  As the new Edwardes-produced [[Edwardian Musical Comedy|"musical comedies"]] took the place of burlesque, [[comic opera]] and [[operetta]] on the stage, Ross and [[Harry Greenbank]] established the usefulness of a separate lyricist.

===Gaiety and Daly Theatre musicals===
Ross contributed lyrics to almost all of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]'s shows, beginning with ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894, with his song "Brown of Colorado") and ''[[Go-Bang]]'' in 1895.  He wrote over two thousand lyrics and produced lyrics for over sixty musicals thereafter, including most of the hit musicals through [[World War I]].  In 1896, he contributed to the Gaiety Theatre hit, ''[[The Circus Girl]]''.  He also wrote lyrics for the one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Weather or No]]'' (1896), which played as a companion piece to ''[[The Mikado]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], as well as several other [[Savoy operas]], such as ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'' (1894), ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]], or The Court of Vignolia'' (1897), ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[Image:Dollarprincess.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lily Elsie]] in ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'']]
Ross also wrote lyrics for the shows at [[Daly's Theatre]].  His lyrics to additional numbers for ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895) and ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) were successful enough so that Edwardes asked him for major contributions to the rest, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), especially after the death of the theatre's early chief lyricist, Harry Greenbank.  These included a series of enormous successes, including ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''Kitty Grey'' (1901), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1903), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907).  In 1901, Ross married Ethel Wood, an actress, and the couple produced a son and two daughters. The family resided in Church Street, [[Kensington]].&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Also in 1901, he collaborated with his sister Mary Emily Ropes on the children's story, ''On Peter's Island''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Adrian|contributor-last=Dalby|contributor-first=Richard|contribution=Preface|title=The Hole of the Pit: And by One, by Two and by Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5i68QO9hh0C&amp;pg=PA10|date=2013|publisher=The Oleander Press|isbn=978-0-900891-86-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Edwardes found success, beginning in 1907, in mounting English-language versions of the new generation of continental European [[operettas]] to the London stage, Ross wrote the English lyrics for the adaptations, often with libretti by [[Basil Hood]].  His words to the songs in ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907) became the standard English version of that piece, performed throughout the world for many decades.  Other Continental musicals that Ross anglicised included ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (1910), ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Marriage Market]]'' (1913), most of which had enduring success throughout the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Other successes from this period were the musicals ''[[King of Cadonia]]'' (1908), ''[[Havana (Edwardian musical)|Havana]]'' (1908), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1911), and ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' in 1915.  In addition, many of Ross's most successful pieces had additional successes on tour in Britain, in America and elsewhere.  His biggest hits on Broadway included ''The Girl from Kays'' (1903), ''The Merry Widow'' (1907 and many revivals), ''Havana'' (1909), ''Madame Sherry'' (1911) and ''The Quaker Girl'' (1911).

===Later career===
[[Image:Lilactimeross.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Sheet music from ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus|Lilac Time]]'']]
In 1914, Ross was one of the founders of the Performing Rights Society.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Ross continued, after Edwardes's death, to write lyrics for numerous shows at the Gaiety, Daly's, the [[Adelphi Theatre]], and other London theatres.  During [[World War I]], he continued to produce hits, writing the lyrics for the musical adaptation of a French comedy, ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916), the musical ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' (1917), [[André Messager]]'s adaptation of [[Booth Tarkington]]'s ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (operetta)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919, "Philomel") and contributed to ''[[A Southern Maid]]'' (1920).  He also worked on the [[revue]]s ''Three Cheers'' (1917) with [[Herman Darewski]], ''Airs and Graces'' with [[Lionel Monckton]], and, years later, ''Sky High'' for the [[London Palladium|Palladium Theatre]], but these were only diversions from his chief focus of writing lyrics for musicals and operetta adaptations.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt; In 1922, he wrote both the book and the lyrics for the popular English version of ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus]]'', the international hit based on [[Franz Schubert]]'s music and life, produced in Britain as ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus|Lilac Time]]''.  In 1927, Ross and Dudley Glass, an Australian composer, collaborated on a musical based on ''The Beloved Vagabond'' by [[W. J. Locke]].  His last works were produced in 1930: the English adaptation of the operetta ''Friederike'' for the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_f/frederica.htm "Frederica"], The Guide to Musical Theatre (NODA)&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical based on ''The Toymaker of Nuremberg'' by Austin Strong, which was produced as a Kingsway Theatre Christmas entertainment.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

Ross collaborated extensively with the foremost British-based composers of musical theatre active during his productive period, including Carr, [[Ivan Caryll]], Monckton, [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]], and later [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]], [[Harold Fraser-Simson]], [[Howard Talbot]] and Messager.  Sixteen of his musicals ran for more than 400 performances.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Ross tailored each song to fit the style required by the producer – songs for the Gaiety were different from those for Daly's. Many of his most popular shows, songs (both for the theatre and beyond it) and adaptations are still performed today.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

===Fiction and last years===
Ross also wrote the popular horror novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories. Set in 1645 during the [[English Civil War]], the novel tells of a loathsome entity that inhabits a flooded pit amid the marshes surrounding a castle. The book is notable for its depth of characterisation – especially of the compassionate young narrator, a [[Puritan]] scholar who has refused to join [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army because of his objections to religious violence and who sees the good in everyone – and for its subtle depiction of the creature in the hole, which is never completely seen even as it overwhelms the castle. The novel was published in 1914 and never reprinted until [[Ramsey Campbell]] collected it in his 1992 anthology ''[[Uncanny Banquet]]''. [[Brian Stableford]] called it "a minor classic of the genre".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford|Stableford, Brian]]. "Ross, Adrian", in [[David Pringle]] (ed.), ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers''. London: St. James Press, 1998, p. 486, {{ISBN|978-1-55862-206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross also wrote ''Short History of Europe'', edited ''Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu's Letters'' (Selection and Life), and was a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;

Ross died of heart failure at his home in [[Kensington, London|Kensington]], London on 11 September 1933 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arthur R.

'''''Alone in the World''''' ({{lang-fr|Seule au Monde}}) is a painting created by nineteenth-century French artist [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. Although the exact year of creation is unknown, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] acquired it in 1867 so it may be placed in the early part of Bouguereau's career.&lt;ref name="wissman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissman |first=Fronia E. |title=Bouguereau |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=San Francisco |date=1996 |page= |isbn=978-0876545829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a peasant girl holding a [[violin]] and standing on a bridge over the [[Seine]] in Paris.  She is looking to her left with a melancholy expression.  The cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] can be seen in the background, as well as a bridge which appears to be the [[Pont Royal]].  This indicates that the girl is standing on the [[Pont de Solférino]].

[[Christianity]] has not generally practised [[aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, but has had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures. However, there are periods of aniconism in [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], notably during the controversy of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected all images in churches, and this practice continues today in Reformed (Calvinist) churches, as well as some forms of [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]]. The [[Catholic Church]] has always defended the use of sacred images in churches, shrines, and homes, encouraging their [[dulia|veneration]] but condemning anyone who would [[latria|worship]] them as if they were gods themselves. 

The use of religious icons and images continues to be advocated at the highest level by religious leaders of major Christian denominations such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCGB2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilliams83/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnPaulAudience/&gt; The veneration of icons is also a key element of the [[doxology]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=webster231/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casiday447/&gt; The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church accept the church council which condemned iconoclasm and mandated the use of sacred images, the icons of saints, and the crucifix in churches, public shrines, and in homes. The explanation of the consistency of sacred images with the Christian religion was largely based on the arguments of [[St. John Damascene]].

Christian aniconism has only very rarely covered general secular images, unlike [[aniconism in Islam]]; [[Anabaptist]] groups such as the [[Amish]] are rare exceptions.

==Early Christianity==
{{more information|Depiction of Jesus}}
Several voices in [[Early Christianity]] expressed "grave reservations about the dangers of images",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"&gt;Freedberg, 176&lt;/ref&gt; though contextualizing these remarks has often been the source of fierce controversy, as the same texts were brought out at intervals in succeeding centuries. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] described the mentions of Christian views on Christian images before the mid-6th century as "scattered and spotty",&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and of an earlier period wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is a striking fact that when painting and sculpture first began to infiltrate Christian assembly rooms and cemeteries they did so practically unheeded by either opponents of or apologists for Christianity—engaged though these were in passionate disputes over idols and idolatry. No literary statement from the period prior to the year 300 would make one suspect the existence of any Christian images other than the most laconic and hieroglyphic of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

— and yet from [[archaeology]] it is clear that the use of quite complex figurative Christian images was widespread by that date. There are mentions of images of [[Jesus]] from the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onwards. The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain the earliest images, mostly painted, but also including [[relief]]s carved on [[sarcophagi]], dating from the end of the 2nd century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus is often represented by [[pictogram]] symbols, though he is also portrayed. In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230-256, which of the very early churches surviving is in the best condition, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134, Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Protestant position on the history of images in places of worship however is expressed by Phillip Schaff, &lt;blockquote&gt;'Yet previous to the time of Constantine we find no trace of an image of Christ properly speaking except among the Gnostic Carpocratians and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus who adorned his domestic chapel as a sort of pantheistic Pantheon with representatives of all religions. The above mentioned idea of the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus the entire silence of the Gospels about it and the Old Testament prohibition of images restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ until the Nicene age when a great reaction in this respect took place though not without energetic and long continued opposition.&lt;ref name= "schaff"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schaff | first = Phillip | title = History of the Christian Church | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | location = Massachusetts | page = 381 | date = 2006 | url = 
https://books.google.com/books?id=NV8sAAAAYAAJ | isbn = 9781565631960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Corby Finney's analysis of Early Christian writing and material remains distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting Early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen". These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Images were also associated with the [[idolatry]] of the pagan [[Ancient Roman religion]] and other cults and religions around them,&lt;ref&gt;Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, et al. "Iconoclasm." In [[Grove Art Online]]. Oxford Art Online, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T039783 subscription required] (accessed April 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and much early Christian polemic was devoted to attacking paganism for idolatry. In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] the issues are discussed in the [[Letters of St. Paul]] and a [[Idolatry and Christianity|prohibition of idolatry]] is included in the [[Apostolic Decree]]. The objections to "decorative and symbolic devices, narrative and didactic images", a description that encompasses much though not all of the earliest Christian art, were much less, as these were not plausibly capable of "idolatric abuse"; according to Kitzinger, "much of the art of the Roman catacombs betrays a studied attempt to avoid any suspicion or encouragement of idolatric practices".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] agrees:"In two-dimensional, applied art of this kind there was never any danger of idolatry in the sense of actual worship of cult-images and votive pictures".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 294-295; see also Jensen, 13-19 on the types of early images.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century there are increased, if scattered, expressions of opposition to images. At the Spanish non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 305) bishops concluded, "Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration", the earliest such prohibition known.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 36, http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/elvira.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius]] (died 339) wrote a letter to [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] (Emperor Constantine's sister) saying "To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error";&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; though this did not stop her decorating [[Santa Constanza|her mausoleum]] with such images. By the end of the century Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (died 403) "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an appeal to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore apart a curtain hanging on the doors of the church decorated with an image of 'Christ or one of the saints' and admonished the other bishop that such images are "opposed&amp;nbsp;... to our religion", while also replacing the curtain with another expensively embroidered one.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm letter 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers cited in later controversies were [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Lactantius]], although evidence of opposition to images by church leaders is often also evidence of their usage in the church.&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the question of images caused a tension in the early church between a theologically-trained clerical elite and the broad mass of followers of the church, and perhaps especially women; the letter of Eusebius being a leading piece of evidence cited here. However other scholars, including Finney and Toynbee,&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii; Toynbee, 295&lt;/ref&gt; dispute this reading of the documentary evidence, pointing out that the physical evidence of sites such as the [[Catacomb of Callistus]] suggests that "church authorities at least tolerated if not approved both the decoration and the content of the iconography on its own property over a fairly long period of time".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that the use of images was regarded as especially characteristic of heretics. [[Irenaeus]], (c. 130–202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic [[Carpocratians]], "They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]". Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense, only of certain gnostic sectarians use of icons. On the other hand, by the 8th century there is evidence that opposition to images was associated with what was by then the largely vanished heresy of [[Arianism]], though the historical evidence for this now appears slender,&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251]&lt;/ref&gt; and important early figurative mosaics in Italy were created under Arian rule.

==After Constantine==
However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: "The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], The Early Church (The Penguin History of the Church, 1993), 283; Hurlbut, J. L. The Story of the Christian Church. Zondervan, 1967, p.62; Loverance, Rowena (2007). Christian Art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility that Christian art was a movement from below, disapproved of by the clerical hierarchy, vanishes in the large churches built with imperial patronage at the urging of that hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest literary evidence of ''[[proskynesis]]'' before images comes from the first half of the 6th century;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94&lt;/ref&gt; it had already been common before the cross by the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 90&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighting of candles before images, and leaving lit candles and lamps (going beyond what might merely be necessary to actually see them) is mentioned in 6th century sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justinian to the Iconoclastic period==
The period after the reign of [[Justinian]] (527-565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 85-87; 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kitzinger, "during the late sixth and seventh centuries devotional practices in front of images became elaborate, common, and intense".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it was in this period that images seem to have become common in Christian homes, and "Once admitted to that sphere their use and abuse was beyond control".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary mentions of Christian images greatly increase, in the accounts of pilgrims to the [[Holy Land]], in works of history, and in popular accounts of the lives of saints; at the same time some of these begin to mention acts of iconoclasm against images. The legendary nature of much of the last two types of material is clear, but the stories remain evidence of practices around images and beliefs as to what images were capable of.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this period that the attribution to individual images of the potential to achieve, channel or display various forms of spiritual grace or divine power becomes a regular motif in literature. In the many miracle stories, there is a "tendency to break down the barrier between image and prototype", so that "the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes&amp;nbsp;... It enacts evangelical teachings,&amp;nbsp;... When attacked it bleeds,&amp;nbsp;... [and] In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Images make promises, and demand that promises made by others are kept, are immune to attack, and most commonly of all, images bestow "some kind of material benefit upon&amp;nbsp;... votaries".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous example of this is the role ascribed to the [[Image of Edessa]] (or Mandylion) in the failure of the Persian siege of the city in 544. The image is not mentioned in the account of [[Procopius]], writing soon after the event, but first appears as the agent of the failure in the history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] of about 593.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;  Though most often images are described as acting through some kind of intermediary, sometimes direct physical contact produces the benefit, as with a dry well that refilled when an icon was lowered in the bucket, or medical benefit ascribed to drinking some ground-up plaster from a fresco in water.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 105-107 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century [[Julian of Atramytion]] objected to sculpture, but not paintings, which is effectively the Orthodox position to the present day, except for small works.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94-95 (with long note); Freedberg, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Byzantine iconoclasm ==
[[File:Irenekirken.jpg|thumb|A simple cross replaced a mosaic figure during the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], [[Hagia Irene]] Church in Istanbul]]
{{Main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}

There were two periods of [[iconoclasm]], or image destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The arguments of the Iconoclasts remain rather obscure, as almost all their writings were [[book burning |destroyed]] after the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]". The simple belief that images were idolatrous appears to have been their main motive; reference was made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], and aniconic statements by the [[Church Fathers]], some of which may now be lost. One theological issue revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96, 106-118, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril, "Historical Introduction," in Bryer &amp; Herrin, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6, "Chronology", pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179, "Anthology of Texts in Translation", pp.&amp;nbsp;180–186&lt;/ref&gt;

The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, involving with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the Pope. There has been much scholarly discussion over the possible influence on the Iconoclasts of the [[aniconism in Islam]], the century-old  religion which had inflicted devastating defeats on Byzantium in the decades preceding. Most scholars reject direct religious influence, though many feel the feeling of crisis produced by defeats at the hands of Islam contributed to the Iconoclast movement. Both the cross and secular two-dimensional images continued to be acceptable, indeed were used to replace religious imagery in the two best-known examples. The defeat of Byzantine Iconoclasm was so emphatic that the issue has never arisen again in Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;98–106, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Iconoclasm==
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] was still avoided in the [[Western Christianity|West]] until the time of [[Charlemagne]] around 800; the [[Franks]] had no association of sculpture with cult images and a life-size [[crucifix]] (with "corpus") known to have been in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a pivotal work, opening the way to the free general use of large sculpture. This was contemporary with the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (see below). Religious sculpture, especially if large and free-standing, has always been extremely rare in [[Eastern Christianity]]. The Western church was anxious to distinguish its use of images from idolatry, and set out its theological position in the Carolingian [[Libri Carolini]], in similar but slightly different terms to those set out by the Eastern church after the episode of Iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33, 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}; Schiller, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In his travels through the [[Auvergne]] between 1007 and 1020 the cleric Bernard of Angers was initially disapproving of the large crucifixes with a sculpted three-dimensional ''corpus'', and other religious statues that he saw, but he came to accept them.  The [[Gero Cross]], the earliest life-size crucifix image to survive, probably dates to around 960.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  

===God the Father===
The depiction of [[God the Father in Western art|God the Father in art]] long remained unacceptable; he was typically only shown with the features of Jesus, which had become fairly standardized by the 6th century, in scenes such as the [[Garden of Eden]]. The rationale for this was the doctrine of the pre-existing Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', which holds that Christ has existed from the beginning of time. Very simply put, as a member of the [[Holy Trinity]] of three persons in one God, representations of God could be achieved by depicting Jesus as ''Logos'', except in the few cases where both Jesus and God the Father needed to be shown separately, as in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus]]. Alternatively God the Father was represented only by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], which probably reached [[Christian art]] from [[Hellenistic Judaism]], as it is prominent in the wall paintings of the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] in [[Syria]]. Depictions of God the Father, essentially as the [[Old Testament]] [[Ancient of Days]], only became common in the West from about 1200 onwards, and remain controversial in Eastern Orthodoxy, still being prohibited by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for example (where images of the Ancient of Days, also banned, are held to represent Christ). Free-standing monumental sculpture is also avoided by the Orthodox churches, and reliefs are much rarer, especially large ones. On the other hand, [[icon]]s have a slightly different theological position in Orthodoxy and play a more significant part in religious life than in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], let alone the Protestant churches.

===Bernard of Clairvaux===
[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153) was an influential [[Cistercian]] monk who famously wrote against the excessive use of imagery in a monastic context, and was largely responsible for the unornamented style of [[Cistercian architecture]]. However his attack concentrated on what he saw as frivolous non-religious elements in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] religious art of his day, which he said distracted monks from their religious life.&lt;ref&gt;"But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness? Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books."{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was prepared to sacrifice religious imagery also, both to save money and avoid "distractions of the senses",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

==Among Nestorians==
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|The Reformation and art}}

Opposition to religious imagery was a feature of proto-Protestant movements such as the [[Lollards]] in England.

The [[Reformation]] produced two main branches of Protestant Christianity; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

On the contrary, at the time of the Reformation, [[Calvinist]]s preached in violent terms the rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices such as religious pictures, statues, or relics of saints, as well as against the [[Lutheran]] retention of [[sacred art]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Karlstadt]] was the earliest extreme iconoclast, to be followed by [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]]. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches (including the Anglican, [[Puritan]]/[[Congregational]] and [[Reformed Baptist]] Churches) completely prohibited the display of religious images. Reformed theologians such as [[Francis Turretin]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Westminster divines|the Divines of the Westminster Assembly]], and later [[Robert Dabney]] and [[John Murray (theologian)|John Murray]],&lt;ref name="the-highway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-highway.com/pictures_Murray.html |title= Murray on pictures of Christ |publisher=the-highway.com|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explicitly reject the depiction of Christ, citing arguments drawn from the second commandment, as well as writings of the early church, using the same texts and arguments as Byzantine iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 165(quoted)-166, 167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Calvinist [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] of 1647 asks in Question 109, 'What are the sins forbidden in the second commandment?
Answer: The sins forbidden in the second commandment are, all devising, counseling, commanding, using, and anywise approving, any religious worship not instituted by God himself; tolerating a false religion; the making any representation of God, of all or of any of the three persons, either inwardly in our mind, or outwardly in any kind of image or likeness of any creature'.

Apart from official destruction of art, there were outbreaks of violent Calvinist [[iconoclasm]] such as the [[Beeldenstorm]] in the [[Low Countries]] in 1566. During this time, [[Anglicanism]], falling with the broader Reformed tradition, also removed most religious images and symbols from churches and discouraged their private use. [[Elizabeth I of England]] was one of many Anglicans to exhibit somewhat contradictory attitudes, both ordering a [[crucifix]] for her chapel when they were against a law she had approved, and objecting forcefully when the [[Dean of St Paul's]] put in the royal pew a service book with "[[woodcut|cuts]] resembling angels and saints, nay, grosser absurdities, pictures resembling the Holy [[Trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Reformed churches are now considerably more relaxed over the use of religious art and symbols than they were in the Reformation period, though many denominations avoid images in churches, and in the Anglican Church matters such as the use of altar crosses and crucifixes can arouse strong feelings. However while portraits of saints were destroyed, portraits of contemporary individuals, including church leaders, were not considered problematic, and exist in large numbers. Reformed Christians did not object to small religious images, typically of episodes from the [[New Testament]], in the form of [[old master print|prints]], and Bible illustrations or picture books, especially those intended for children, were and continue to be widely used in Protestantism,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventing the Holy Land: American Protestant Pilgrimage to Palestine, 1865–1941|author=Rogers, S.S.|date=2011|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739148440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeMlQ4xgB60C|page=24|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so that in the 17th century, even "the ordinary Puritan enjoyed a Bible with pictures".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=From Sacred to Secular: Visual Images in Early American Publications|author=Lacey, B.E.|date=2007|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=9780874139617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VXsjvrmMvAC|page=17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faced with the Protestant challenge to imagery, then far more virulent than it usually is today, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] reacted by quietly removing some types of medieval imagery that could not be justified theologically, but otherwise by strengthening its commitment to the use of art and images to promote the Christian message, though tightening up on the detailed content of imagery, which was brought under stricter control by the church.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual end of the production of religious painting in Reformed parts of Europe had the effect of diverting artistic production into secular subjects, especially in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century. While Catholic Europe was still producing [[Baroque]] altarpieces in large numbers, the Netherlands produced genre scenes, very often of ungodly behavior, still lifes, portraits and landscapes. Moralistic messages were often attached to these, though the subject matter often fights somewhat with them. Protestant religious art, mainly in the form of illustrations of biblical events, continued in [[printmaking]] and book illustrations, for example in the [[etching]]s of [[Rembrandt]], who also painted biblical subjects. In the early stages of the Reformation, Protestant propagandists made vigorous use of images satirizing their opponents.

Calvinist aniconism, especially in printed material, and stained glass, can generally be said to have weakened in force, although the range and context of images used are much more restricted than in Catholicism, Lutheranism, or parts of Anglicanism, the latter of which also incorporated many high church practices after the [[Oxford Movement]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">'''Certosina''' is a decorative art technique used widely in the [[Italian Renaissance]] period. Similar to [[marquetry]], it uses small pieces of wood, bone, metal, or mother-of-pearl to create inlaid geometric patterns on wood. The term comes from [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa Church in Pavia]], where the technique was used in ornamenting an altarpiece.

{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian art''' is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from [[Christianity]]. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had [[Aniconism in Christianity|strong objections to some forms of religious image]], and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
{{main|Early Christian art and architecture}}
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century.  The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and show the evolution of the [[depiction of Jesus]], a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.

Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.  Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style  from the  classical tradition inherited from [[Ancient Greek art]] to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of [[gothic art]].

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval art}}
[[File:Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|12th-century Byzantine mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] showing the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]].]]
Much of the art surviving from [[Europe]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] is Christian art, although this in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works.  While the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of [[Rome]], its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day [[Roman Catholic Church]] commissioned  and funded production of religious art imagery.

The [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]], which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving [[Eastern Empire]] was key in commissioning  imagery there and glorifying Christianity. As a stable Western European society emerged during the [[Middle Ages]], the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine Empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people.  Realistic perspective, proportions, light and color were ignored in favor of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events.  The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|280px|[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] (1498).]]
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as [[icon]]s regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.

In the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be commissioned  in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy.  The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

Artists were commissioned more secular genres like [[portrait]]s, [[landscape painting]]s and because of  the revival of Neoplatonism,  subjects from [[classical mythology]].  In Catholic countries, production continued, and increased during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before.  From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.

===Modern period===
As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal.  Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]).  However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Dali]] is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/resources/DaliandReligion.pdf |title=Dali and Religion |work=National Gallery of Victoria, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]] and [[John August Swanson]]. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Gregory|title=Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age|year=2011|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|isbn=978-1-933859-88-0|pages=278|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Will-Save-World-Ideological/dp/1933859881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular devotional art===
Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular [[Christian culture]]. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: S Chledowski Arms.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Stephen Chłędowski coat of arms:bestowed by [[Elizabeth II]] Queen of Canada]] --&gt;
This noble family traces its origins to the territorial County of Gniezno in the Voivodeship of Greater Poland. There in the administrative district of Gmina Witkowo is the village of [[Chłądowo]]. In 1692 Chłądowo (at the time called Chłędowo) was owned by the Chłędowski family. This branch of the family belongs to the [[Gryf]] Clan.  

Seweryn Chłędowski, a prominent member of the family purchased  the estates of [[Wietrzno]] in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] in 1810. From this branch Freiherr Adam von Chłędowski of the [[Bończa coat of arms|Bończa]] Clan married Ida Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen, the adopted daughter of Count Franz Simon Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen (1753–1840). From this marriage issued 2 sons Ludwig and Casimir, who received from Emperor [[Francis Joseph I]] the hereditary title of Baron and the right to use the name Chłędowski von Pfaffenhofen.

The clause states that the [[United States Congress]] shall have power "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."

The clause is the basis of [[intellectual property]] laws in the United States, specifically [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright]] and [[Patent law of the United States|patent]] laws.

== History ==
On August 18, 1787, the Constitutional Convention was in the midst of a weeks-long stretch of proposals to establish what would become the enumerated powers of the [[United States Congress]]. Three such proposals made on that day addressed what are now lumped together under [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]]. One, by [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] was "to secure to authors exclusive rights for a limited time". The other two were made by [[James Madison]], who had previously served on a committee of the Congress established under the [[Articles of Confederation]] which had encouraged the individual states to adopt copyright legislation. Madison proposed that the Constitution permit Congress "to secure to literary authors their copyrights for a limited time", or, in the alternative, "to encourage, by proper premiums &amp; Provisions, the advancement of useful knowledge and discoveries".&lt;ref name="William F. Patry 1994"&gt;William F. Patry, ''Copyright Law and Practice'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both proposals were referred to the [[Committee of Detail]], which reported back on September 5, 1787 with a proposal containing the current language of the clause. No record exists to explain the exact choice of words selected by the Committee on Detail, whose task was essentially no more than creating a draft Constitution by arranging the proposals that had been made into the most appropriate language. On September 17, 1787, the members of the Convention unanimously agreed to the proposed language, without debate, and this language was incorporated into the Constitution.&lt;ref name="William F. Patry 1994"/&gt;

== Effect ==
The clause actually confers two distinct powers: the power to secure for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings is the basis for [[United States copyright law|U.S. copyright law]], and the power to secure for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries is the basis for [[United States patent law|U.S. patent law]]. Because the clause contains no language under which Congress may protect [[trademark]]s, those are instead protected under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Some terms in the clause are used in archaic meanings, potentially confusing modern readers. For example, "useful Arts" does not refer to artistic endeavors, but rather to the work of [[artisan]]s, people skilled in a manufacturing craft; "Sciences" refers not only to fields of modern scientific inquiry but rather to all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ochoa |first=Tyler T.  |editor-first=Peter K.  |editor-last=Yu |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2007 |pages=133 |chapter=Chapter 7: Copyright Duration: Theories and Practice |isbn=9780275988838 |oclc=71427267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Clause is the only clause granting power to Congress for which the means to accomplish its stated purpose are specifically provided. The exact limitations of this clause have been defined through a number of [[United States Supreme Court]] cases interpreting the text. For example, the Court has determined that because the purpose of the clause is to stimulate development of the works it protects, its application cannot result in inhibiting such progress.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, there has been a countervailing strain in the courts that has promoted a varying view.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Furthermore, the clause only permits protection of the writings of authors and the discoveries of inventors. Hence, writings may only be protected to the extent that they are original,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 349 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and "inventions" must be truly inventive and not merely obvious improvements on existing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Graham v. John Deere Co.]]'', 383 U.S. 1 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; The term "writings of authors" appears to exclude non-human authorship such as painting by chimpanzees and computer code written by programmed computers,&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices § 313.2 (3d ed. 2017) ("The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.").&lt;/ref&gt; but the issue has not been tested in litigation.

Although perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited&amp;mdash;the language specifies "limited times"&amp;mdash;the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute a perpetual copyright. In that case, the United States Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the [[Copyright Term Extension Act|Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]], also known pejoratively as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://econ161.berkeley.edu/movable_type/archives/000835.html  A Platonic Dialogue on ''Eldred v. Ashcroft''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Petitioners in that case argued that successive retroactive extensions of copyright were functionally unlimited and hence violated the ''limited times'' language of the clause.  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]], writing for the Court, rejected this argument, reasoning that the terms provided by the Act were limited in duration and noted that Congress had a long history of granting retroactive extensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6436">The '''Duluth Art Institute''' ('''DAI''') is a non-collecting arts and cultural institution that specializes in local and regional contemporary art from the [[Twin Ports]] Region and the [[Upper Midwest]]. It was founded in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] in 1907 and is one of the oldest art centers in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]]. Based on the curatorial model of the German "[[kunsthalle]]," the DAI is a community arts center that works closely with artists and the community, creating associated symposia, workshops, and studios.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

The Duluth Art Institute has two locations. The main exhibition space is located in the [[Duluth Depot]], the historic train station in Duluth that also houses the [[Lake Superior Railroad Museum]], the [[St. Louis County Historical Society Museum]], a Veteran's Memorial Hall, and several performing arts organizations. A second location is situated in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, a burgeoning Duluth "Crafts District." The DAI Lincoln Center is located within a renovated Carnegie library with historical status. It serves as a community center for arts education and houses multipurpose classroom spaces, a darkroom, ceramics studios, a fiber studio maintained by the Duluth Fiber Handcrafters Guild, and professional development services for artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hemphill|first1=Stephanie|title=Art centers help more than artists|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2006/02/27/artcenterimpact|work=MPR News|date=February 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Cathy |last=Kates |url=http://kkcb.com/our-beautiful-duluth-art-institute-houses-many-learning-opportunities-video/|title=Our Beautiful Duluth Art Institute Houses Many Learning Opportunities|website=B105|date=February 10, 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Duluth Art Institute originated as an art club established by Bishop McGolrick in 1897.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mattson |first=Julia |url=https://www.howiehanson.com/lincoln-park-business-profile-duluth-art-institute/|title=Lincoln Park Business Profile: Duluth Art Institute |date=August 23, 2013|website=HowieHanson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the '''Duluth Art Association''' was officially incorporated.&lt;ref name="UMD"/&gt; The original Board of Trustees included G.G. Hartley and [[Chester Adgate Congdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stahl|first1=Brandon|title=Mural celebrates 100 years of Duluth art|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/mural-celebrates-100-years-duluth-art|work=Duluth News Tribune|date=March 5, 2007|page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the '''Duluth Art Institute Association''', a separate arts organization, was active. The organizations merged in 1946, retaining the name Duluth Art Institute Association. The organization later dropped the Association from their name. In 1976, the Duluth Art Institute relocated to the St. Louis County Heritage and Arts Center. The arts organization opened an additional location in the old [[Lincoln Branch Library|Lincoln branch library]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="UMD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maus|first1=P.|title=Duluth Art Institute (1907-) |url=https://libarchive.d.umn.edu/?p=creators/creator&amp;id=641|publisher=Archives and Special Collections, Kathryn A. Martin Library, [[University of Minnesota Duluth]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duluth Art Institute hosts a [[biennale|biennial]] that dates back to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Virtucio|first1=V. Paul|title=Duluth Art Institute's Biennial Exhibit Features the Very Best Regional Art|work=Duluth News Tribune|date=November 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly called the Arrowhead Art Exhibit, it is now known as the Arrowhead Biennial Exhibition.&lt;ref name="UMD"/&gt;

In 1990, the DAI auctioned off the eight paintings in its permanent collection because it was not equipped to care for the works. The paintings included pieces by [[Knute Heldner]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Charles Rosen (painter)|Charles Rosen]], and David Ericson. The auction was criticized by the St. Louis County Historical Society and residents who wanted the art to stay in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oakes|first1=Larry|title=Duluth Art Institute auctions its paintings|work=Star Tribune|date=May 8, 1990|page=01B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist residency ==
In March 2017 The Duluth Art Institute started an artist-in-residence program. The first artist to participate in the program was Duluth-based Paul LaJeunesse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/4228032-duluth-art-institute-names-artist-residence|title=Duluth Art Institute names artist-in-residence|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current artist-in-residence is painter Adam Swanson, who is working on a Public Art project to be unveiled in the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Duluth Art Institute [https://www.lpbg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Adam-Swanson-press-release.pdf press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Décollage''', in [[art]], is the opposite of [[collage]]; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image.&lt;ref name="ArtLex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ See D-De] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, ArtLex Art Dictionary. Retrieved 2007-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The French word "décollage" translates into English literally as "take-off" or "to become unglued" or "to become unstuck". Examples of décollage include [[Surrealist techniques|etrécissements]] and [[cut-up technique]]. A similar technique is the ''lacerated poster'', a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath.

==Practitioners of décollage==
An important practitioner of décollage was [[Wolf Vostell]]. Wolf Vostell noticed the word "décollage" in [[Le Figaro]] on 6 September 1954, where it was used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell’s working concept of décollage, was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from [[Media (communication)|media]]. He also called his [[Happening]]s Dé-coll/age-Happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturstiftung.de/publikationen/arsprototo/ausgaben/3-2013/mediale-wanderungen/ Wolf Vostell, Dé-coll/age-Happening]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Beuys Brock Vostell. Aktion Demonstration Partizipation 1949-1983.''. ZKM-Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie, Hatje Cantz, Karlsruhe, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-7757-3864-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatjecantz.de/beuys-brock-vostell-6226-0.html Beuys Brock Vostell]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most celebrated artists of the décollage technique in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are [[François Dufrene]], [[Jacques Villeglé]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Raymond Hains]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Straram, "La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée" (Paris Sens &amp; Tonka, 2006), 21–22, 81–82; "Figures de la négation" ([[Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne]], 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his decollage destroys the [[advertisement]], but leaves its remnants on view for the public to contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called [[Nouveau Réalisme]] (New realism), Paris' answer to the American [[Pop Art]] movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included [[Yves Klein]] and [[Christo]] and was created with the help of critic [[Pierre Restany]]), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.

Lacerated posters are also closely related to [[Richard Genovese]]'s practice of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar décollage techniques are [[Mark Bradford]], Michael Viviani and [[Brian Dettmer]], who employs a novel method of decollage by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses [[digital media|digitally]] enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine [[Paper Mulberry]], torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.

Décollage is now commonly used in the French language in regard to aviation (as when an aeroplane lifts off the ground). More recently the term has been used in space flight; the web page for [[ESA]] indicates its use equivalent to "We have lift-off!" at a [[NASA]] launch center.

==Déchirage==
Déchirage (from the French, déchirer: 'to tear') is an artistic style that distresses paper to create a three-dimensional patchwork. It is a form of décollage, taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. [[Romare Bearden]] (b. 1911 – d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;'Bearden as Abstract Expressionist' http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ENG-mam/bio3.htm Maalek Marshall, Virginia Commonwealth University webpages.&lt;/ref&gt; The first public display of "Photographic" Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the ''Art of Giving''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saatchionline.com/art/view/artist/162075/art/91318#comment-76575-91318 Sea-cloth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220105041/http://www.saatchiart.com/art/Collage-Sea-cloth/162075/91318/view|archivedate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibition at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It can be argued that the depliage is a form of décollage, as it is made by initially removing the staples from a staple-bound [[magazine]].

The '''Eclipse Process Framework''' (EPF) is an [[Open-source software|open source]] project that is managed by the [[Eclipse Foundation]].  It lies under the top-level [[Eclipse Technology Project]].  It has two goals:

*To provide an extensible framework and exemplary tools for software process engineering - method and process authoring, library management, configuring and publishing a process.
*To provide exemplary and extensible process content for a range of software development and management processes supporting iterative, agile, and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental development]], and applicable to a broad set of development platforms and applications.  For instance, EPF provides the [[OpenUP]], an [[agile software development]] process optimized for small projects.

By using EPF Composer, engineers can create your own [[Software development process]] by structuring it using a predefined schema. This schema is an evolution of the SPEM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm SPEM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030033843/http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.1 [[Object Management Group|OMG]] specification referred to as the Unified Method Architecture (UMA). Major parts of UMA went into the adopted revision of SPEM, SPEM 2.0. EPF is aiming to fully support SPEM 2.0 in the near future. The UMA and SPEM schemata support the organization of large amounts of descriptions for development methods and processes. Such method content and processes do not have to be limited to software engineering, but can also cover other design and engineering disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, business transformation, and sales cycles.

IBM supplies a commercial version, [[IBM Rational Method Composer]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Limitations ==
The "Content Variability" capability severely limits users to one-to-one mappings.  Processes trying to integrate various aspects may require block-copy-paste style clones to get around this limitation.  This may be a limitation of the SPEM model and might be based on presumption that agile methods are being described as these methods tend not to have deep dependencies.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Production==
The Co-production of ''Feathered Dreams'' came as a result of the need for Ukrainian filmmakers to get into the Nigerian market and the African market at large.&lt;ref name="SIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://steppesinsync.com/2012/07/31/the-first-nigerian-film-production-in-europe-it-turns-ukrainian-phones-red-and-challenges-half-of-a-yellow-sun-in-authenticity/ | title=The first Nigerian film production in Europe.

His decision to act in the film was due to the lack of English speaking actors in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="kiev" /&gt;

According to the folklore of the borders it was considered unlucky to step upon "unchristened ground" (the graves of stillborn or unbaptised children) and any who did were said to catch "grave-merels" (or "grave-scab") an illness that causes difficulty of breathing and trembling limbs as well as the burning of the skin as if touched by a hot iron.&lt;ref name=henderson1/&gt; The only way for this to be relieved was for the unfortunate to wear a sack made from linen grown in a field using manure from a farmyard that has not been disturbed for forty years, spun by ''Habetrot'', bleached by an honest bleacher in an honest miller's [[milldam]] and sewed by an honest tailor.&lt;ref name=henderson1/&gt;

[[File:Michelle Borromeo Actor Headshots 30.jpg|thumb|180px|Head shot of actress]] 
A '''head shot''' or '''headshot''' is a modern (mostly digital files ) [[portrait]] where the focus is on the person. The term is usually applied for professional profile images on social media, the 'about us page' or a corporate website and promotional pictures of [[actor]]s, [[model (profession)|models]], and [[author]]s. 

==Entertainment industry==
In [[theater]], film, and [[television]], [[actor]]s, [[Model (person)|models]], [[singers]], and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. These head shots are usually more artistic: they intend to portray the subject in the best possible light.&lt;ref name="popphoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2015/04/tips-pro-peter-hurley-high-end-headshot-photography|title=Tips From a Pro: Peter Hurley on High-End Headshot Photography|last=Kolonia|first=Peter|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Popular Photography|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center.  A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called "looks". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person’s shoulders are called "three-quarter" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/headshots/taking-your-best-shot/|title=Taking Your Best Shot|last=Sanville|first=Michael|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Backstage|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors' head shots, when printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8"×10" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.

The main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very "neutral" looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.

Head shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.

==Modeling industry==
[[File:Modelling Headshot by Headshot London Photography.jpg|thumb|180px|Modelling headshot]]
Modeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Modeling head shots are usually used for:
* Comp cards or tear sheets
* Modeling portfolios
* TV advertisements for skin products
* Magazine advertisements for creams and other skin or hair products
* Online industry profiles

Models' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.

[[Comp card]]s are one of the cornerstones of a model’s “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all 
comp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images. A model may have four to five images on the comp card and at least one of these images will be a head shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Corporate and business head shots==
[[File:Corporate Headshot of Douglas Anderson.jpg|alt=|thumb|269x269px|Example of corporate head shot featuring entrepreneur and business coach Douglas Anderson of DA Talent]]
Corporate head shots are portraits often produced digitally and used for engaging in social media, the 'about us' page and industry specialty sites. A ''headshot'' or ''head shot'' is often used for branding and to showcase the executive team, style and personality.  Corporations will use the headshot to merge branding between the people working for them and its agency. 

Corporate head shots serve a variety of purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artofheadshots.com/professional-profile-picture/|title=Professional profile picture|last1=Locke|first1=David|date=October 26, 2017|website=artofheadshots.com|publisher=Business professional specialized in headshot photography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding headshots==
Branding headshots may be a corporate or business headshot with the difference being that the image is designed to convey the individual's or a corporate branding identity. A corporation may chose a streamlined background for all its headshots while an individual may chose an action, experience or background objects to identify his or her brand. Large corporations, firms and/or agencies will usually have a manual for the type and style of headshot to be photographed.

The '''Hoosier Salon''' is an annual juried art exhibition that features the work of [[Indiana]] artists and provides them with an outlet to market their work. The Hoosier Salon Patron's Association, the nonprofit arts organization that organizes the event, also operates year-round galleries in [[Carmel, Indiana]] and [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. These spaces host exhibitions of Salon artists throughout the year, as well as workshops and demonstrations. An artist must have lived in [[Indiana]] and must be a member of the Hoosier Salon arts organization to become eligible for the Salon's exhibitions. The Hoosier Salon has exhibited art from many of Indiana's most notable painters, sculptors, cartoonists, and mixed-media artists, including [[Hoosier Group]] artists, several members of the [[Brown County Art Colony]], and other artists with ties to Indiana.

The Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], hosted the first annual Hoosier Salon in 1925 at the [[Marshall Field and Company]]'s galleries in [[Chicago]]. In 1942 the annual exhibition was relocated to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, where it has been held at several venues, including the [[William H. Block Co.|William H. Block Company]] and the [[L. S. Ayres|L. S. Ayres and Company]] department stores, the [[Indiana State Museum]], and the [[Indiana Historical Society]]. The Hoosier Salon has survived wars, economic recessions, a fire, venue changes for its annual exhibition, relocation of its offices and gallery spaces, and modifications to its outreach programs. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth continuous year of annual exhibitions.

==History==

===Origins in Chicago===
The idea for the Hoosier Salon originated in May 1924, when the 160-member Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the Chicago metro area, held a gathering devoted to [[Hoosier]] painters.&lt;ref name=GT1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Judith Vale Newton |author2=Carol Weiss | title =A Grand Tradition: The Arts and Artists of the Hoosier Salon, 1925–1990  | publisher =Hoosier Salon Patrons Association | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Indianapolis, IN | page =1 | url = | isbn =0-9638360-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this initial meeting, Estella King, chair of the group's arts committee, led the organization's plans for an exhibition featuring high quality artwork from Hoosier artists that would help gain more recognition for them outside of Indiana. The group's goals were to inspire Indiana artists to develop their talents, to showcase artists who depicted Indiana themes in their work, and to provide an opportunity to market their art.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marilyn Shank| title =Art for Indiana's Sake: A History of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =24 | issue =3 | page =15 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Summer 2012 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoosier Salon's name and concept come from the nineteenth-century French tradition of annual art exhibitions held in the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs- Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton23&gt;{{cite journal | author=Judith V. Newton | title =This Eternal Beauty: Celebrating the Art of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =6 | issue =4| pages =23 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Fall 1994 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, [[Illinois]], was selected as the site for the first Hoosier Salon because of its large population and its reputation as a [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] art center.&lt;ref name=GT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt; The annual Salon ran in Chicago from 1925 through 1941, when it moved to [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Since January 1942 the annual exhibition has taken place at various sites around Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton24&gt;Newton, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early exhibitions===
The first Hoosier Salon ran from March 9 to 19, 1925, at the art galleries of [[Marshall Field's|Marshall Field and Company]] at 28 East Washington Street in Chicago.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 15 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daughters of Indiana, who organized and sponsored the first Salon, were assisted by several other groups, such as the Indiana Society of Chicago and volunteers from Chicago's [[Earlham College]] Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;

The first Hoosier Salon was open to painters who had lived in Indiana for at least a year. Entries for the juried exhibition were submitted from across the United States. The selections featured 253 works of art from 132 artists.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=IHS-INP&gt;{{cite journal | title =Hoosier Salon: Celebrating a 90-Year History of Honoring Indiana Artists | journal =INPerspective | volume =20 | issue =3 | page =6 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis, IN | date =May 2014 | language = | url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoosier Group artist T. C. Steele and his wife, Selma, attended the opening of the Salon's first exhibition, which was well received by art critics and the public.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first exhibition's favorites was a set of three "[[Little Orphan Annie]]" cartoons from their creator, [[Harold Gray]], a 1917 graduate of [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt; Hoosier artists whose work also appeared at the first Salon included all four Hoosier Group members who were still living ([[T.C. Steele]], [[William Forsyth (artist)|William Forsyth]], [[Otto Stark]], and [[J. Ottis Adams]]). Other exhibitors with Indiana ties included [[Wayman Elbridge Adams]], [[Frank V. Dudley]], Frederick M. Polley, [[Will Vawter|J. Will Vawter]], [[Eugene Savage]], and Clifton Wheeler, among others. Traditional Indiana landscapes and still-life paintings were represented, as well as works from Hoosier artists who lived outside the state.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18&gt;Shank, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first Hoosier Salon merit prizes were awarded to Steele for ''Winter Morning, First Snow'', judged best picture  and painted by a man more than sixty years of age. Wayman Adams won a $200 merit award for his oil portrait of Indiana author [[Booth Tarkington]], and Forsyth's ''Glory of Autumn'' still life won a $100 merit prize. Savage, who was originally from [[Covington, Indiana]], won the top prize of $500 for ''Recessional''. Thirty percent of the accepted entries came from women artists, including two works submitted by [[Marie Goth]]. Several women were recognized with merit prizes for their art: Dorothy Morlan for ''Frosty Morning, Southern Indiana''; Lucy M. Taggert for ''Eleanor''; Laura A. Fry for ''A Shaft of Sunlight''; Lucie Hartrath for ''The Valley, Morning''; and [[Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer]] for ''A Garden''.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louise Zaring]] received a prize for Best Marine Scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b75ab2bab49cc41eda0989f2e&amp;id=3c2f9b5474|title=Indiana and Florida artist Louise Eleanor Zaring|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marguerite B. Williams, art critic for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', remarked at the time of the first Salon that Indiana was well known for its writers; however, "it would seem that some of this desire for self-expression has overflowed into painting for there is probably no other state that could show as many and such a high average of practically unknown painters."&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; Hoosier authors Tarkington, [[George Ade]], and [[Meredith Nicholson]] supported the idea of an annual exhibition featuring Indiana artists. In the forward to the Hoosier Salon's exhibition catalog in 1926, Nicholson wrote, "we are anxious for our brothers and sisters who paint or draw or sculpt to have their day in court, just as we have had it."&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;

Following the critical and popular success of the first exhibition, the Daughters of Indiana wanted to make it an annual event that was open to artists with ties to Indiana. In 1926 the second Hoosier Salon ran for fourteen days at Marshall Field's galleries in Chicago. It featured 339 works by 149 artists and drew more than 50,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; For the first time the show was opened to sculpture in addition to paintings. [[Janet Scudder]], a native of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], who gained an international reputation for her work as a sculptor, earned the $300 merit prize for her outstanding sculpture called ''Victory''. Wayman Adams won the $500 merit prize for the exhibition's outstanding picture, ''The Art Jury'', a life-size portrait of the four surviving members of the Hoosier Group&amp;ndash;Steele, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and Forsyth.&lt;ref name="GT2-3"/&gt; (Steele and Stark died by the end of 1926; J. Ottis Adams died in 1927.)&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; [[William Edouard Scott]], a former student of Stark, was one of the first African American artists to participate in the Hoosier Salon. Scott exhibited ''Lights on a Summer Night'' at the second Hoosier Salon.&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;

===Other events===
In 1926, after the Daughters of Chicago hosted the second exhibition, the group partnered with other art patrons to formally organize the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, a nonprofit organization that would continue the event and its original mission of recognizing talented Indiana artists. John C. Shaffer, editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Evening Post]]'', the ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'', and newspapers in [[Muncie, Indiana]], and Terre Haute, Indiana, became the Association's first president. Estella King, a native of [[Peru, Indiana]], and chair of the Daughters of Indiana art committee for the first two Hoosier Salons, became the group's executive chairman.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt; In addition to the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, ongoing sponsors and supporters of the annual Hoosier Salon have included Kappa Kappa Kappa, first connected to the Salon in 1927; Delta Sigma Kappa sorority, a supporter since 1937; and [[Psi Iota Xi]], a sponsor since 1941.&lt;ref name=Shank22&gt;Shank, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 5, 22, and 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hosting the annual Salon during its seventeen-year run in Illinois, the patron’s association opened a year-round gallery on October 15, 1928, in donated space in the ''Chicago Evening Post'' Building on West Wacker Drive.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85/&gt; Art that had appeared in at least one of the Salons could be exhibited and sold at the Chicago gallery. The Association also hosted traveling exhibitions, a tradition that continued over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief time the group's Hoosier Program Bureau, which was formed in 1929, helped Hoosier musicians secure public appearances. The offering was discontinued in 1941, when the Salon moved its headquarters to Indianapolis and the group decided to focus on visual arts.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26&gt;Newton, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, not all of the Salon's exhibitions were held in Chicago. In June 1936 the Hoosier Salon held its annual exhibition during the summer months at the [[Lake Wawasee history#Spink Wawasee Hotel|Spink-Wawasee Hotel]] at [[Lake Wawasee]] in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20&gt;Shank, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the Art Department of the Woman's Department Club of Indianapolis sponsored a traveling Hoosier Salon exhibition at the William H. Block Company's department store in downtown Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; Following the success of this event in Indianapolis and continued support from the department store, the Woman's Department Club was instrumental in helping to move the Salon's headquarters and its annual exhibition to Indianapolis in 1942.&lt;ref name=Shank22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this same time several of the early leaders in Chicago began to retire, moved away, or experienced failing health, so it was not unexpected that on June 30, 1941, the Salon's trustees formally voted to approve the move of its headquarters to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana years===
In late 1941 the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association moved into two donated rooms in the State Life Building (also known as the Thomas Building) on Washington Street in Indianapolis. These rooms also served as the Association's art gallery until 1973, when fire destroyed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 20 and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Salon's relocation to Indiana, several new sponsors began their longtime support of the Hoosier Salon. Representatives from the Woman's Department Club and its Art Department, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Psi Iota Xi, and women from the Indiana Federation of Clubs and the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs formed the Hoosier Salon Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the move from Chicago, the Association's next annual Hoosier Salon opened in downtown Indianapolis on January 19, 1942, for a two-week run in the sixth-floor auditorium of the William H. Block Company department store at Market and Illinois Streets.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The event took place shortly after the bombing at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the war effort "dominated the show."&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Lillian Alt's ''Men and Guns'' and William A. Eyden Jr.'s ''Steel for Defense'' were among the 261 pieces on display.&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The annual Salon was scaled back during World War II, and the wartime themes that continued for several years frequently outnumbered the usual landscapes, still lifes, and portraits.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;

In 1949 the Hoosier Salon marked its twenty-fifth year, a significant achievement that also achieved national recognition. After the Salon's run in Indianapolis, a special exhibition featuring all 168 pieces from the Indiana show were exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|National Museum of American Art]] in April 1949.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indiana State Society of [[Washington, D.C.]], sponsored two fund-raising events for the Salon's exhibition in Washington, D.C.&amp;mdash;a style show at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] and a dance at the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel|Shoreham Hotel]], where Hoosier songwriter [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and his wife, Ruth, were special guests.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s several artists who had contributed to the first exhibitions in Chicago continued to submit works for the Salons, including Polley, Wheeler, and Wayman Adams, among others. Salons in the 1960s marked the changing times for Hoosier artists with the introduction of new materials, such as prints, metal sculpture, collage, and fewer of the more traditional landscapes of southern Indiana.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23&gt;Shank, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few weeks before the Hoosier Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition of 1974, disaster struck. On November 5, 1973, a fire destroyed the Thomas Building, including the Salon's historical materials and 311 paintings. The Association established temporary offices at the back of the William A. Block department store’s auditorium and resumed plans for the annual exhibition. A [[Lilly Endowment]] grant of $5,000 and additional $1,000 contributions from several sponsors allowed the Hoosier Salon to open in January 1974, although the other planned events were cancelled. The Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition included 163 pieces from 117 different artists. Goth and William A. Eyden Jr. were honored at the annual event. Both of these artists had contributed art for the original exhibition in 1925.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goth had work accepted for every Salon since 1925; her last Salon entries were in 1975. See Newton and Weiss, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon exhibition remained at Block's department store in Indianapolis from 1942 to 1977. The event moved to the L. S. Ayres department store in downtown Indianapolis at Meridian and Washington Streets in 1978, and remained there until 1989. From 1990 to 2011 the annual exhibition was held at the Indiana State Museum. In 2012 the exhibition moved to the Indiana Historical Society's Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71 and 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual juried art exhibition continues to showcase the works of Hoosier artists from all walks of life. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth consecutive annual exhibition.&lt;ref name=IHS-INP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton27&gt;Newton, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1974 the Hoosier Salon purchased the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Bals-Wocher mansion on Indianapolis's North Delaware Street as the new location for its year-round gallery. Because the nonprofit did not have the funds to operate two galleries, it closed its gallery in the former Indianapolis [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotel]] lobby at Meridian and Ohio Streets in December 1974.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 60 and 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 the Bals-Wocher mansion proved too costly for the group to maintain, so the Salon sold it and moved its gallery to the Morrison Opera building on Indianapolis's South Meridian Street, where it had been renting office space.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1991 the Association relocated its offices to North College Avenue in Indianapolis's [[Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis|Broad Ripple Village]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =75th Hoosier Salon Diamond Jubilee Gala Celebration (Invitation)  | publisher =Hoosier Salon | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1999 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | url = | isbn =}}, in the collections of the William H. Smith Memorial Library, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; where it had previously established a year-round gallery.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; The Hoosier Salon operated two other galleries in addition to the one in Broad Ripple. One gallery was at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]; the other at [[Wabash, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank24-25&gt;Shank, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 the Hoosier Salon maintained gallery space at New Harmony, but the Wabash gallery closed and the property owner converted it to another purpose.&lt;ref name=Eason&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Eason | title =Hoosier Salon moving main gallery to Carmel | newspaper =Indianapolis Star | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2014-04-16 | url = http://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/hamilton-county/2014/04/16/hoosier-salon-moving-main-gallery-carmel/7782609/ | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the annual Hoosier Salon remains the organization's biggest event, it also provides other outreach efforts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; In 2006 the Hoosier Salon initiated the French tradition of a [[Salon Des Refusés]] (exhibition of rejects) at its Broad Ripple gallery.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt; The Salon also provides educational outreach to schools and collaborates with other organizations to promote the arts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;

In May 2014 the Hoosier Salon closed its main gallery in Broad Ripple and moved to a new gallery space in the Carmel Arts and Design District in Carmel, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hoosier Salon art gallery opens in Carmel | work = | publisher =Indianapolis Star  | date =2014-05-10 | url = http://www.indystar.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/arts/2014/05/10/hoosier-salon-art-gallery-opens-in-carmel/8955009/| format = | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoosier Salon artists==
Since 1925, many of Indiana's most notable artists have exhibited at the Hoosier Salon. In order to qualify as a Salon exhibitor, an artist must be a Hoosier Salon member and must have lived in Indiana for a minimum of one year at any point during their life. Salon entries are independently reviewed by experienced judges in the art field and selected for the annual exhibition. The works of well-established master artists are displayed alongside the work of newcomers to the field.&lt;ref name=Shank24-25/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Lieber  | first = Tammy  | title = Hoosier Salon paints its role in broad strokes  | newspaper = Indianapolis Business Journal  | location = Indianapolis, Indiana  | pages =| language =   | publisher =  | date = September 12, 2005  | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/10575806-1.html  | accessdate = November 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon claims ties to the Hoosier Group and several members of the Brown County Art Colony.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; However, not all of the Salon's art has Indiana as it subject. Work from Salon artists with Hoosier ties is inspired from locales outside Indiana as well. New York City-based Wayman Adams, born near [[Muncie, Indiana]], exhibited his artwork at the Salon for thirty-five years.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Several southwestern artists  were linked to Indiana as well. [[Shelbyville, Indiana]], native [[William Victor Higgins]], who was a member of [[New Mexico]]'s "Taos Ten", and [[Gustave Baumann]], who worked in [[Brown County, Indiana]], for seven years before moving to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in 1918, were Salon exhibitors. [[Fairmount, Indiana]], native [[Olive Rush]], whose art studio was in Santa Fe, was a Salon prizewinner.&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In the past, Hoosier cartoonists have been well represented at the Salons. In addition to comic-strip illustrator Harold Gray's "Little Orphan Annie", cartoonists who competed for the Salon's prizes and recognition were [[Kin Hubbard|Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard]]'s nationally syndicated "Abe Martin" cartoons; [[Gaar Williams]], who created "Among the Folks in History"; [[Fontaine Fox]], creator of the syndicated cartoon"[[Toonerville Folks|Toonerville Trolley]]"; and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[John T. McCutcheon]], who drew editorial cartoons. Gray, Hubbard, Williams, and McCutcheon also provided artwork to help advertise the Salon.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In more recent years Salon entries have changed to reflect the new artistic styles of Hoosier artists. Past Salon works have included Kanwal Prakash (K. P.) Singh's architectural renderings, lithographs from Garo Z. Antreasian, watercolors from Floyd Hopper, portraits by [[Nancy Noel]], the acrylics of James Lee Cunningham, and abstract art from Martha Slaymaker.&lt;ref name=Newton27/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT298&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''indie design''' movement is made up of independent [[designer]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[craftspeople]] who [[design]] and make a wide array of products − without being part of large, industrialised businesses. The indie design movement can be seen as being an aspect of the general indie movement and [[DIY culture]].

The designs created generally include works and art pieces that are individual to that creative individual.  Such products may include [[jewellery]] and other [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[clothing]], [[glass art]], [[metalwork]], [[furniture]], [[cosmetics]], [[handicrafts]], and diverse [[artwork]]s.

==Marketing==
Self-employed indie designers are supported by shoppers who are seeking niche and often handmade products as opposed to those mass-produced by manufacturing and retail corporations. 

Indie designers often sell their items directly to buyers by way of their own online shops, [[craft fairs]], [[street market]]s and a variety of online marketplaces, such as [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |title= Crafts, Clothes and Clout: Small Designers Reach Larger Audience With Growth of Web and TV Showcases |author= Christina Binkley |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704009804575309034273947988?mod=googlewsj |newspaper= Wall Street Journal |date= June 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may also engage in consignment and/or wholesale relationships with retail outlets, both online and offline.

;Corporate knockoffs
In recent years some large manufacturing and/or retail [[fashion company|fashion]] and other [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[corporation]]s have sold products which appear to closely resemble or directly copy innovative original works of indie designers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Michal Addady, [http://fortune.com/2016/07/20/zara-stealing-designs/ "12 Artists Are Accusing Zara of Stealing Their Designs"], ''Fortune'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused some controversy.

The practice of '''releasing [[video game soundtrack]]s on''' [[gramophone record|'''vinyl''' record]]s began in the 1980s, fell out of favor in the 1990s and 2000s as vinyl records were replaced by other storage media, and experienced a resurgence of interest in the 2010s due in part to a [[vinyl revival]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;

==History==
Vinyl recordings of video game music find their origins in the 1970s with early experiments by [[Kraftwerk]]&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt; and [[album]]s such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled 1978 release]] sampling electronic music from the games ''[[Circus (video game)|Circus]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and ''[[Gun Fight]]''.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In 1984, [[Haruomi Hosono]] released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, ''Video Game Music'',&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt;&lt;ref name=savorelli/&gt; and the practice experienced its "golden age" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including [[Buckner &amp; Garcia]]'s ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]'', [[Namco]]'s ''Video Game Graffiti'', and [[Koichi Sugiyama]]'s orchestral covers of the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to [[Promo (media)|promo releases]] with increasing use of video game [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in rap&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; and hip hop.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

The trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt; The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games,&lt;ref name=mcgeehan/&gt; and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like [[Black Screen Records]],&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; [[Data Discs]],&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; [[Brave Wave]], and [[iam8bit]],&lt;ref name=beaumontthomas/&gt; and shifts toward similar releases for labels like [[Ghost Ramp]],&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomer/&gt; [[Ship To Shore Phonograph Co.]],&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt; and [[Mondo Tees]].&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; In a 2015 article, music journalist [[Mike Diver]] suggested that "this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times", however he noted that some in the music industry, including [[Invada Records|Invada]] manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of [[Market saturation|over-saturation of the market]].&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs,&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble,&lt;ref name=gach/&gt; in 2017 ''Kotaku'' reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

The 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases [[Limited edition (music)|in limited numbers]] and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In addition, the practice has been adopted by the [[Cult video game|cult]]&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; and [[Indie game]] scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; interactivity,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; artwork,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; nostalgia,&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; unique content,&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible ([[Digital distribution|digitally distributed]]) products&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games,&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game,&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the "golden age" of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;

== Vinyl data ==
The use of grooved vinyl discs as a [[Sequencer (musical instrument)|sequenced/encoded]] rather than [[Analog recording|recorded]] data storage medium enabled the code of [[full motion video|full motion videos (FMVs)]] and even simple video games to be stored in an [[Analog recording|analog format]] along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED)]], and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] from the disc (typically a [[flexi disc]] like the ''Interface Age'' "[[Floppy ROM]]") onto an [[audio cassette tape]] which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore PET]], [[Commodore VIC-20]], [[Dragon 32/64]], [[ZX81]], or [[ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt; The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an [[arcade machine]]) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its [[record needle|stylus]] at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques ([[background noise]], [[Abrasion (mechanical)|scratches]], and [[Broken record|other audio-fidelity problems]])&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt;&lt;ref name="bennett82-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

'''''Love for Sale: Pop Music in America''''' is a 2016 book by ''[[The Nation]]'' music critic David Hajdu, in which he chronicles the 100-plus year history of pop music in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2016/10/15/498056629/-love-for-sale-a-history-of-pop-music-that-s-as-personal-as-it-gets | title = 'Love For Sale': A History Of Pop Music That's As Personal As It Gets | date= October 15, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''NPR'' | author = Scott Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features previously published material as well as interviews, including an interview with legendary [[folk singer]] [[Dave Van Ronk]].&lt;ref name="BuffaloReveiw"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://buffalonews.com/2016/10/22/editors-choice-love-sale-pop-music-america-david-hajdu/ | title = Editor's Choice: Love for Sale: Pop Music in America by David Hajdu | date= October 22, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Buffalo News'' | author = Jeff Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically, ''Love for Sale'' takes the reader from the origins of  [[ragtime]] in the 19th century through to the present era of [[Streaming media|streaming]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freebeacon.com/culture/one-book-music-lovers-read/ | title = The One Book Music Lovers Have to Read | date= January 8, 2017 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Washington Free Beacon'' | author = Matthew Walther }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also sequential discusses the rise of tapes, CDs, and MP3s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.columbia.edu/reviews/fall-2016/%e2%80%9clove-sale-pop-music-america%e2%80%9d | title = 'Love for Sale: Pop Music in America' | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Columbia Magazine'' | author = Eric Liebetrau }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book is derived from the 1930 [[Cole Porter]] [[Love for Sale (song)|song of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/how-strange-the-change-on-david-hajdus-history-of-american-pop-music/ | title = How Strange the Change: On David Hajdu’s History of American Pop Music | date= October 16, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Los Angeles Review of Books'' | author = Dylan Hicks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love for Sale'' constitutes Hajdu's attempt to answer the question: “What is the history and meaning of pop music?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/love-sale-pop-music-america | title = 'Love for Sale: Pop Music in America' | date= October 19, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Commonwealth Magazine'' | author = James Mcfetridge Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the book a generally favorable review, calling it, "very educational and entertaining". Still, the review cautioned that, "If [the book] were an album, it would be a collection of singles and B-sides meant to hold the fans at bay until the next major release."&lt;ref name="NTYREVIEW"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/books/review/name-those-tunes-david-hajdus-pop-music-memories.html | title = Name Those Tunes: David Hajdu’s Pop Music Memories | date= December 2, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''New York Times'' | author = Jim Windolf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' described ''Love for Sale'' as, "idiosyncratic romp through the history of the American popular music industry."&lt;ref name="BostonGlobeReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2016/10/30/idiosyncratic-personal-history-pop-music/TZV3S3E9HivSky1I62DUAM/story.html | title = An idiosyncratic, personal history of pop music | date= October 31, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Boston Globe'' | author = James Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was favorably reviewed by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Associated Press]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="WSJReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-victrolas-to-the-ipod-1478474748 | title = From Victrolas to the iPod | date= November 7, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Wall Street Journal'' | author = Eddie Dean }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/books/2016/10/19/review-critic-writes-personal-history-pop-music/92423680/ | title = Review: Critic writes personal history of pop music | date= October 19, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Detroit Free Press'' | author = Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanityFairReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/10/the-must-read-books-of-the-fall-from-wayne-gretzkys-to-brit-bennetts-debut | title = The Must-Read Books of the Fall, from Wayne Gretzky’s Memoir to Brit Bennett’s Debut | date= October 19, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Vanity Fair'' | author = Sloane Crosley }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KirkusReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-hajdu/love-for-sale-pop-music/ | title = LOVE FOR SALE, Pop Music in America by David Hajdu | date= October 18, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Kirkus Reviews'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MonumentConquerorsSpace00.jpeg|thumb|Monument to the Conquerors of Space]]
The '''''Monument to the Conquerors of Space''''' ({{lang-rus|Монуме́нт «Покори́телям ко́смоса»|r=Monumént "Pokorítelyam kósmosa"|p=mənʊˈmʲent pəkɐrʲˈitʲɪlʲɪm ˈkosməsə}}) was erected in [[Moscow]] in 1964 to celebrate achievements of the [[Soviet people]] in space exploration. It depicts a starting rocket that rises on its exhaust plume. The monument is 107 meters (351 feet) tall, has 77° incline, and is made of [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/M329 |title=Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics website |publisher=Museum.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics]] is located inside the base of the monument.

==Location and surroundings==

The monument is located outside the main entry to today's [[VDNKh (Russia)|Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy]] (''VDNKh''), in the northeastern part of Moscow, near Prospekt Mira ("Peace Avenue"). The easiest access is from the [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh subway station]].

Since the 1960s, this part of Moscow in general has had a high concentration of space-themed sights and names: besides the monument and the museum under it, the grand "Cosmos" pavilion in the Exhibition Centre displayed many artifacts of the [[Soviet space program]]. Many streets in the area have been named after the precursors of the space program ([[Nikolai Kibalchich]], [[Friedrich Zander]], [[Yuri Kondratyuk]]) and its participants ([[Sergey Korolyov]]).

The [[Cosmonauts Alley]] south of the monument features [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] of Soviet cosmonauts.

The choice of this part of Moscow for space-related names and monuments may have been inspired by the fact that Prospekt Mira runs toward the north-eastern suburbs of Moscow, where, in [[Korolyov (city)|Podlipki]]
(today's Korolyov City) much of the space program was based. [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]] himself lived in a house within a few blocks from the monument, which is now preserved as Korolyov Memorial Museum ({{lang-ru|Дом-музей академика С.&amp;nbsp;П.&amp;nbsp;Королёва}}).

==History==

In March 1958, a few months after the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', a competition was announced for the best design of an obelisk celebrating the dawn of the [[Space Age]]. Out of some 350 proposals, the design by [[sculptor]] [[A.P. Faidysh-Krandievsky]] and architects [[A.N. Kolchin]] and [[M.O. Barshch]] was chosen. The grand opening of the monument took place on October 4, 1964, on the day of the 7th anniversary of the ''Sputnik 1'' launch.

The monument was designed to accommodate a museum in its base. However, it took until April 10, 1981 (two days before the 20th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight) to complete the
preparatory work and open the [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics]]. The museum reopened on April 12, 2009 after three years of renovations.

==Design and sculpture==
[[File:Monumentos a los Conquistadores del Espacio 04.JPG|thumbnail|right|Front of the stone base]]
The main part of the monument is a giant [[obelisk]] topped by a rocket and resembling in shape the exhaust plume of the rocket. It is 107 meters (350&amp;nbsp;feet) tall and, on Korolyov's suggestion, covered with [[titanium]] cladding.

A statue of [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the precursor of astronautics, is located in front of the obelisk.

A poem in Russian on the front of the stone base of the monument base says:
{{quotation|И наши тем награждены усилья,&lt;br /&gt;
Что поборов бесправие и тьму,&lt;br /&gt;
Мы отковали пламенные крылья&lt;br /&gt;
:Своей
::Стране
:::И веку своему!}}

Approximate translation:
{{quotation|And our efforts are rewarded,&lt;br /&gt;
we have overcome powerlessness and darkness, &lt;br /&gt;
We've forged these flaming wings.&lt;br /&gt;
:For our
::Nation
:::And this age of ours!}}

Below, in smaller letters, is the dedicatory statement:
"В ознаменование выдающихся достижений советского народа в освоении космического пространства сооружен этот монумент" ("This monument was constructed to celebrate the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in space exploration"), and the year, 1964.

Both sides of the monument base, in their front parts, are decorated with [[high relief|haut-]] and [[bas-reliefs]] depicting men and women of the [[Soviet space program|space program]]: 
scientists, engineers, workers, their occupations indicated by appropriate accoutrements of the professions. Notable figures include a [[computer programmer]] (or perhaps some other computing or telecommunications professional) holding a [[punched tape]], a [[cosmonaut]] wearing a space suit, and [[Laika]] the space dog, first animal to orbit Earth.

No contemporary Soviet politicians are depicted in the monument either (that would violate the convention existing in the post-[[Joseph Stalin]] [[Soviet Union]] against commemorating living persons in this fashion), but the crowd on the right side of the monument are moving forward under the banner of [[Vladimir Lenin]].

==The monument reflected in other media==
The ''Monument to the Conquerors of Space'' is featured on the 1967 ten-[[Soviet Ruble|kopeck]] piece, one of the series of the [[Commemorative coins of the Soviet Union|commemorative coins]] issued to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. This coin has the distinction of being the smallest-denomination commemorative coin ever minted in the Soviet Union. (It was the smallest coin in the 1967 series—the only time commemorative fractional currency coins were ever produced in the USSR. All later commemorative coins were either 1 [[ruble]], or a higher denomination).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Monument is also featured in the music video "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]" by [[Pet Shop Boys]].

Also monument featured in the music video "[[Sweet Lullaby (song)|Sweet Lullaby]]" by [[Deep Forest]].

The monument is depicted on the home kit for the [[Russia national football team]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] on the front of the shirts in different shades of maroon.

==Replicas==
[[File:Боровск КЭЦ.JPG|thumb|right|Tsiolkovsky monument in Borovsk]]
The monument to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in downtown [[Borovsk]], designed by Sergey Bychkov, contains a nearly exact scale replica of the ''Conquerors of Space'' "rocket needle" and a whimsical statue of Tsiolkovsky gazing into the skies (and wearing [[valenki]] boots). It was unveiled in 2007. A copy of this statue (but not the "rocket needle") is installed at the [[Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium]]. A copy is also exhibited in the park of the United Nations Office in Geneva, a gift donated by the USSR and designed by the architect Alexander Koltchin and sculptor Yuri Neroda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600581D0E/(httpPages)/1CF0E20D6BC97A1680256EF700594A1C?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

'''Napkin folding''' is a type of [[decorative folding]] done with a [[napkin]]. It can be done as art or as a hobby. Napkin folding is most commonly encountered as a table decoration in fancy restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Doris (2005). Napkin Folding for Every Occasion. New York: Sterling Publishing. p. 9. {{ISBN|9781402728020}}. "It is no accident that fine restaurants have long preserved the art of napkin folding as an important element of presentation."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, and for best results, a clean, pressed, and starched square cloth (linen or cotton) napkin is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marthastewart.com/276337/napkin-folding-ideas/@center/276958/holiday-entertaining#267716 | title=Napkin Folding Ideas | publisher=Marthastewart.com | accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations in napkin folding in which a rectangular napkin, a [[napkin ring]], a glass, or multiple napkins may be used.

== History ==
The earliest instruction manual for the artistic folding of napkins was published in 1639 by Matthia Gieger, a German meat carver working in Padua, as a part of a series of treatises on culinary arts titled Le tre trattati.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ediblegeography.com/the-history-and-techniques-of-napkin-folding/|title=The History and Techniques of Napkin Folding|website=www.ediblegeography.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napkin folding has a centuries-old history&lt;ref&gt;Hetzer, Linda (2001).

'''Nrityagram''' is India's first modern [[Gurukul]] (residential school) for [[Indian classical dance]]s and an [[intentional community]] in the form of a dance village,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Karen |author2=David Levinson |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, (Volume 1)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA726&amp;dq=%22Nrityagram%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nrityagram%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-2598-8|page=726}}&lt;/ref&gt; set up by [[Odissi dance]]r [[Protima Gauri]] in 1990. The residential school offers training in Indian classical dance forms, [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], [[Mohiniattam]], [[Kathak]], [[Bharatnatyam]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathakali]] and [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], eight hours a day, six days a week for seven years, following the ancient [[Guru-shishya tradition]].&lt;ref name="hit"/&gt; Designed by famous Indian architect [[Gerard da Cunha]], the community is situated near [[Hesaraghatta Lake]] 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bengaluru]].&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bindloss|first=Joe |author2=Sarina Singh |title=India: Lonely planet guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&amp;pg=PA894&amp;dq=%22Nrityagram%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nrityagram%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1-74104-308-5|page=894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble has performed across India and in many countries abroad.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/20/AR2009032003565.html|title=Beauty Pours Forth With The Greatest of Ease|last=Kaufman|first=Sarah|date=21 March 2009|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/arts/dance/21danc.html?ref=arts|title=Dance Review: Spirits That Fly High While Rooted in Tradition|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|date=21 February 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Odissi danseus.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Classical Dancers at Nrityagram.]]
The word Nrityagram, literally translated, means "dance village,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2008/mar/27/nrityagram-dance-ensemble/|title=Nrityagram Dance Ensemble|date=27 March 2008|work=Santa Barbara Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in founder, Protima Gauri's own words,

{{quote|"It is a community of dancers in a forsaken place amidst nature. A place where nothing exists, except dance. A place where you breathe, eat, sleep, dream, talk, imagine - [[dance]]. A place where all the [[Sense|five senses]] can be refined to perfection. A place where dancers drop negative qualities such as jealousy, small-mindedness, greed and malice to embrace their colleagues as sisters and support each other in their journey towards becoming dancers of merit."}}

[[File:Grounds and gardens of the Nrityagram Dance Community.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Grounds and gardens of the Nrityagram following [[vernacular architecture]].]]
Protima left Mumbai in 1989 to start the dance village, the land was given on lease by state government and by 1990 the institution had taken root, inaugurated on 11 May 1990, by the then Prime Minister, V.P. Singh.&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=3233|title=Nrityagram and the Passion for Dance|last=Venkataraman|first=Leela|date=30 July 2010|publisher=''The Island''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being designed by the well- reputed Indian architect [[Gerard da Cunha]], the building started coming up soon after, following the [[Indian vernacular architecture|vernacular architecture]] of the region. The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble made its New York debut in 1996 and received rave reviews.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Lynne Fernandez a Delhi-based theatre actress and light designer, first came to Nrityagram in December 1995 to coordinate Surupa Sen's debut and the Nrityagram ensemble's trip abroad and after Protima suffered a mild heart attack, Lynn became actively involved managing the institution, as Protima gradually withdrew. Eventually Protima formally handed over Nrityagram to Lynne Fernandez on 10 July 1997, who became the Managing Trustee of the institution.&lt;ref name=ip&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970724/20551073.html|title=Falling in step|last=Kalghatgi|first=Manjiri|date=24 July 1997|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in August, Protima Gauri set off on her pilgrimage to [[Kailash Mansarovar]] and it was there that she died in the [[Malpa landslide]], near [[Pithoragarh]] on the night of 18 August 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EFDC1F3CF933A0575BC0A96E958260 Obituary] ''[[New York Times]]'', 30 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Nrityagram has grown in its stature by leaps and bounds and is known today for some of the best ensemble work in. Perfection in dance along with a high level of good technical support, leading to a complete presentation, is its trademark. Even today, gurus and students work in the fields within the Nrityagram, which has 10 acres of land, and grow their own food. Over the years, only Odissi gurukul has been functional due to paucity of funds.&lt;ref name="hit"/&gt;

Surupa Sen who first came as a student, debuted in 1995, later became artistic director of Nrityagram in 1997, and remains to date.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;  Orissa Dance Academy (ODA) student Bijayini Satpathy who was first student of Nrityagram, is now in charge of the Odissi gurukul.&lt;ref name=te&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main47.asp?filename=hub161010HIP_right.asp|title=Getting the HIP right|volume=7 | issue=41 | date=16 October 2010|newspaper=[[Tehelka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Nrityagram's few but meritorious students include, Pavithra Reddy, who has had her solo debut in 2003 and who will be hopefully seen in some solo pieces on a wider platform very soon. She has spent almost 12 years as a residential student at Nrityagram, and has learnt under the tutelage of Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy. Ayona Bhaduri and Priyambada Patnaik are also students at this gurukul. They both joined Nrityagram in 1998 and have been a part of the ensemble since 2001.
[[Vasanta Habba]], a cultural event organised by Nrityagram is known as the classical [[Woodstock]] of [[India]], first started in 1994 by Protima, held on first Saturday of February every year, and soon it became the famous annual night-long festival of arts that had 40,000 visitors when it was last held in 2004.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt; When the [[2004 tsunami]] struck, the subsequent 2005 event was cancelled, and community hasn't been able to regroup since,&lt;ref name="hit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/03/05/stories/2007030500920300.htm|title=Waiting for spring|date=5 Mar 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it hopes to restart it in 2011.&lt;ref name=te/&gt;
A 30-minute documentary on the dance village, ''Nrityagram: For the Love of Dance,'' directed and produced by Nan Melville was premiered at the annual Dance on Camera Festival, in New York City on 25 January 2010 to which dance critic [[Alastair Macaulay]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' responded, .."much of the dance footage, not least during the closing credits, is spellbinding. I wanted the film to be twice as long." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/arts/dance/25documentary.html?_r=1|title=Dance: Freezing Motion in a Festival of Dance Films|last=Macaulay|first=Alastair|date=24 January 2010|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nrityagram Dance Ensemble==
The 1996 New York debut of the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble, with Surupa Sen, Bijayini Satpathy, Anitha Nair, Pavithra Reddy and Jaya Mukherjee was called, "one of the most luminous dance events of the year" by [[Jennifer Dunning]], the dance critic of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance in Review|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|authorlink=Jennifer Dunning|date=22 June 1996|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its New York debut, the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble has performed to sold-out  shows in Hawai and Bozeman, USA, Middle East, Far East and Europe, and in time created a niche for itself in the world of dance.&lt;ref name=is/&gt; Today, apart from lead dancer-choreographers, Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy, Pavitra Reddy, Rasmi Raj and Manasi Tripathy are the other permanent  dancers of the Ensemble, and are accompanied by musicians like Swain playing the percussion instrument, ''Mardala'', Srinibas Satapathy’s on [[Bamboo flute]] ([[Bansuri]]) and Sanjib Kumar Kunda on the violin.&lt;ref name=sw/&gt; Its first full-length production "Sri - In Search of  the Goddess", was premiered in Delhi in 2001 and in the United States in 2002-2003,  to critical acclaim. Since then it created several productions including, "Ansh", "Sacred Space" (2005),  and "Separation and the Duality of the human  spirit" (2008) &lt;ref name=is/&gt;

By 2008, the ensemble had made 12 tours of the US, its 2006 production, ''Vibhakta'' (The Division), by Surupa Sen which was performed together by Surupa Sen, the artistic director, and Bijayini Satpathy was listed in "The Ten Best Dance Performances of 2008" by dance critic [[Joan Acocella]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/12/joan-acocella-the-ten-best-dan.html#ixzz12GPEDGFW|title=Joan Acocella: The Ten Best Dance Performances of 2008|date=9 December 2008|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to it in February 2008, the Ensemble had the world premiere  of "''Pratima'': Reflection", at [[New York City]], [[Joyce Theater]].&lt;ref name=sw&gt;[http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_08/mar08/rs_rev_nrityagram_dance_ensemble_0208.htm Rachel Straus, (February 2008), Review: Nrityagram Dance Ensemble: ‘Pratima: Reflection’, ''Ballet.co.uk''], accessed 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It has also performed at [[Pittsburgh Dance Council]] (2002).

'''''Orun Mooru''''' (English: '''''Heaven is Hot''''') is a 1982 Nigerian [[comedy film]] directed by [[Ola Balogun]] and produced by [[Moses Olaiya]] (Baba Sala). The film narrates the story of a once successful businessman who was tricked by a herbalist into a failed [[get-rich-quick scheme]], and then decides to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W."&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=kRR2fBv2NhUC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=orun+mooru&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYpKWdv-3eAhUSqxoKHerPA8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=orun%2520mooru&amp;f=true |title=African Cinema: Postcolonial and Feminist Readings |last=Harrow |first=Kenneth W. |date=1999 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780865436978 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Orun Mooru'' narrates the story of Karounwi (Moses Olaiya), a basketmaker who lives in a fishing village. Flashback shows that he used to be a thriving businessman, until he was tricked by a Babalawo (herbalist) into believing that he could fill oil drums with money.

Karounwi receives a loan of ₦500 from a friend. He loses all the money; half to a pickpocket, and the other half when his wife exchanged the drums he saved the money for new plates. This turn of events led him into committing suicide and he finds himself in the underworld.

Iku (means: ''[[Death (personification)|Death]]'') tells him that he isn't ready for his coming, Karounwi then ascends to meet the Ayo (means: ''Joy''), who then sends him off with two magical eggs and two of her disciples, to escort him back to earth.

Upon reaching earth in a lavish mansion, Karounwi has sex with the two disciples from the underworld, then breaks one of the eggs, which transforms into a huge pile of money. He goes ahead to break the second egg, despite the standing instruction not to do so. Upon doing so, Death appears. 

Karounwi is seen coming into his shack in the fishing village. A flashback shows that he has been fished out of the water from under the bridge he had thrown himself to commit suicide.

Harrow states: "The themes of over-reaching greed and wild swings from the village life from the lavish property and back again, are close to the heart Nigerian national experience during the oil boom years [...] Propelled by his moral wills, Baba Sala bounces among four sharply opposing realms".&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;

==Piracy==
Not long after the theatrical release of ''Orun Mooru'', it got pirated and bootlegged following the theft of the film's master celluloid tape.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt; The piracy happened before the end of the theatrical run of the film; several cinemas in different cities across the country screened the film without being licensed to do so and remuneration never reached the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://punchng.com/baba-sala-forgave-those-who-pirated-orun-mooru-before-he-died-emmanuel-son/ |title=Baba Sala forgave those who pirated Orun Mooru before he died –Emmanuel, son |last=Makinde |first=Femi |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss incurred as a result of this piracy significantly affected the career of Moses Olaiya in the film industry, as well as his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=NsQwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=orun+mooru&amp;dq=orun+mooru&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV38XHv-3eAhVlxYUKHT-LCgk4ChDoAQhJMAg |title=Glendora Review |date=2001 |publisher=Glendora International (Nigeria) Limited |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/movies/7-movies-produced-by-baba-sala-and-which-he-played-lead-roles-id8951145.html |title=7 movies produced by Baba Sala and which he played lead roles |last=Bada |first=Gbenga |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newtelegraphng.com/2017/05/bala-sala-never-recovered-orun-mooru-travails/ |title=Bala Sala: I never recovered from my Orun Mooru travails |last=Adeyemo |first=Adeolu |date=2017-05-27 |website=www.newtelegraphng.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.informationng.com/2017/03/things-didnt-know-moses-olaiya-aka-baba-sala.html |title=Things you didn't know about Moses Olaiya aka ( Baba Sala ) - INFORMATION NIGERIA |date=2017-03-14 |website=INFORMATION NIGERIA |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy of ''Orun Mooru'' has been reported as a first major incidence of piracy in the Nigerian film industry.&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tns.ng/moses-olaiya-baba-sala-comedy-legend/ |title=Moses Olaiya Adejumo (Baba Sala): The Comedy Legend Who Was Brutally Attacked By Pirates |last=Odejimi |first=Segun |date=2018-10-08 |website=TNS |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201811140097.html |title=Nigeria: Beyond Laughter, a Purvey of Baba Sala's Role in Nigeria's Economic Development |last=Adejumo-Ayibiowu |first=Oyindamola |date=2018-11-14 |website=The Guardian (Lagos) |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Otaku no Video'''''|おたくのビデオ|Otaku no Bideo|lit. ''"Geeks' Video"''}} is a 1991 [[anime]] spoofing the life and culture of [[otaku]], individuals with obsessive interests in media, particularly anime and [[manga]], as well as the history of [[Gainax]], its creators.  It is noted for its mix of conventional documentary film styles (with actual film, no less), with a more traditional anime storytelling fashion. It is licensed in the United States by [[AnimEigo]]. The ''[[DAICON III and IV Opening Animations]]'' from the early eighties are also featured in this OVA.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in ''Otaku no Video 1982'', where the main character is an [[everyman]] character,&lt;ref&gt;"''Otaku no Video''{{-'}}s story starts out, more or less, like most every anime about anime fans since then. Normal guy meets otaku and gets sucked into the world of cosplay, doujinshi and video games, and life as he knew it changes forever."  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-11-15&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Kubo, living with his girlfriend Yoshiko and as a member of his college's [[tennis]] team, until introduced by his former friend Tanaka to a club of enthusiasts: a female illustrator, an information [[geek]], a martial artist, and a weapons collector. Kubo soon joins them; and when Yoshiko abandons him, makes the wish to become the supreme enthusiast, under the name of "Otaking".

Kubo's quest continues in ''More Otaku no Video 1985'', set three years later, in which he creates his model kits, opens shops, and builds a factory in China. Later, he loses his fortune when one of his rivals (now married to Yoshiko) takes control of his enterprise; but Kubo and Tanaka, with hard-working artist Misuzu, gradually take over the anime industry with a 'magical girl' show, "Misty May". At the peak of their ambitions, Ken and Tanaka create Otakuland in 1999: the equivalent of [[Disneyland]] for otaku (the story suggests Otakuland to be located in the same city of [[Urayasu]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], as the original [[Tokyo Disneyland]].)&lt;ref&gt;"Urayasu City is where Tokyo Disneyland is located." http://www.animeigo.com/liner/anime/otaku-no-video&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, Ken and Tanaka return to Otakuland in a post-apocalyptic submerged Japan and find its central structure, a giant robot, converted into a functional spaceship piloted by their old friends. Miraculously rejuvenated, they fly into space in search of "The Planet of Otaku".

==''A Portrait of an Otaku''==
A controversial and humorous part of ''Otaku no Video'' was the inclusion of live-action documentary excerpts, titled "A Portrait of an Otaku". In these segments, the documentary crew would interview an anonymous otaku, typically ashamed at being a fan and whose face are censored with a [[Pixelization|mosaic]] and have their voices digitally masked. The mock documentary segments serve as a counterpoint to the anime: while the anime emphasizes the camaradrie, creativity, and dreams of mainstream acceptance of otaku, the mock interviews exaggerate its negative qualities. The subjects run the gamut of the otaku subculture: the interviews cover a [[cosplay]]er who now works as a computer programmer and outright denies his cosplay days, even when presented with photographic evidence, but keeps his [[Char Aznable]] helmet in his desk drawer, an [[airsoft]] otaku, a [[garage kit]] otaku, and a shut-in who videorecords television programs for trade, but has not actually watched anything he's recorded. The interviews also contain fans who engage in a range of illicit or unsavory activities, such as [[cel]] thieves, a [[pornography]] fan attempting to manufacture glasses to defeat the mosaic censorship common in Japanese porn videos and who is shown [[masturbate|masturbating]] during the interview, and a computer gamer—famous Gainax member [[Hideaki Anno]]—obsessed with a character in a [[hentai]] computer game (Noriko from ''[[Gunbuster]]''—one of Anno's works—who makes a cameo in Gainax's own hentai game, ''Cybernetic High School'').

It is believed that all the subjects in the Portrait of an Otaku segments were Gainax employees or connected to Gainax at the time of filming.&lt;ref&gt;"...the acting is particularly hammy, and each person is actually a friend or employee of Gainax..." http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;  The first otaku interviewed bore a remarkable resemblance to [[Toshio Okada]], a principal founder in Gainax, in both background and physical appearance. The [[gaikokujin|gaijin]] otaku, Shon Hernandez, has been confirmed to have been Craig York, who with Shon Howell and [[Lea Hernandez]], whose names were borrowed for the character,&lt;ref&gt;"Shon Hernandez" is a combination of Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez, who, together with Craig York (the real person in this segment), were the core of General Products USA." http://www.animeigo.com/liner/anime/otaku-no-video&lt;/ref&gt; were the main staff of General Products USA, an early western branch of Gainax's merchandising enterprise in the early 1990s. The interview with "Shon Hernandez" has been a point of contention with Lea Hernandez, who, in an interview with ''[[Pulp (Viz Media magazine)|PULP]]'' magazine, noted that the interview was unscripted and that Craig York had been fairly sincere in his thoughts and had felt that Gainax insulted their American members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Carl Gustav |last=Horn |date=August 2001 |title=The Curse of Urusei Yatsura: Interview: Lea Hernandez |url=http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/5.08/interview_hernandez_01.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913202702/http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/5.08/interview_hernandez_01.shtml |archivedate=September 13, 2006 |work=[[Pulp (Viz Media magazine)|PULP]] |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, the words spoken by Shon Hernandez in the background are noticeably different from what is shown on screen via subtitle (which is based on the Japanese voice-over "translation").

At [[FanimeCon]] 2003, Hiroshi Sato, an animator and another Gainax member, mentioned that he had been in one of the interviews in ''Otaku no Video''. In ''Otaku no Video'', the garage kit otaku was given the [[pseudonym]] "Sato Hiroshi" for the interview.

==Production and release==
Since ''Otaku no Video'' was partially based in the personal life of the original creators of Gainax, who started their careers as otaku during the late seventies and the beginning of the eighties, many anime titles from that period are shown as footage or referenced in the OVA (in costumes, cosplay or other related material). Among them are ''[[Gatchaman]]'', ''[[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]]'', ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', ''[[Dirty Pair]]'', ''[[Space Adventure Cobra]]'', ''[[Phoenix 2772]]'', ''[[Silent Möbius]]'', ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'', ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'', ''[[The Wings of Honneamise]]'', ''[[Top o Nerae!]]'' and the ''[[Daicon III and IV Opening Animations]]''.

''Otaku no Video'' was released with subtitles on VHS in North America on March 17, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Video Release Schedule: Coming Soon in America |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=March 1993 |page=18 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt; on DVD on April 2, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Otaku no Video |url=http://dvdlist.kazart.com/queryDVDList2.php3?id=15116 |publisher=Michael's Movie Mayhem |department=BIG List of DVD Releases |access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Blu-ray Disc on June 24, 2016, all by [[AnimEigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Robert J. |last=Woodhead |authorlink=Robert Woodhead |date=June 24, 2016 |title=Update #40: Ship Happened... |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/otaku-no-video-otaking-edition-subtitled-anime-blu/posts/1611566 |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |department=Otaku no Video Otaking Edition Subtitled Anime Blu-Ray |access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most forms of Western music can make use of the piano, pianists have a wide [[Piano repertoire|repertoire]] and a wide variery of styles to choose from, among them traditional [[classical music]], [[jazz piano|jazz]], [[blues piano|blues]], and all sorts of [[popular music]], including [[rock music|rock and roll]]. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other [[musical keyboard|keyboard]]-related instruments such as the [[synthesizer]], [[harpsichord]], [[celesta]], and the [[organ (music)|organ]].

==Pianists past and present==
Modern [[classical music|classical]] pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and learning new works to expand their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and [[chamber music]], while others (though comparatively few) will perform as full-time soloists.

==Classical ==
[[File:Ian Parker.jpg|thumb|300px|Canadian pianist [[Ian Parker (Canadian pianist)|Ian Parker]] performing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1]] with the Maui Pops Orchestra in 2016|alt=A man plays a piano with enthusiasm, his left hand raised in preparation for striking keys; behind him, the string section of an orchestra plays accompaniment.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  [[Liszt]], [[Brahms]], [[Chopin]], [[Mendelssohn]] and [[Rachmaninoff]]. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and [[Hans von Bülow]]. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.

==Jazz ==
[[File:Tord Gustavsen (221258).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tord Gustavsen]] playing piano during a concert at the 2016 [[Oslo Jazzfestival|Oslo Jazz Festival]] in Norway
|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man playing a piano; he is hunched over it and is concentrating deeply.]]Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include [[Art Tatum]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Bud Powell]].

==Pop==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include [[Victor Borge]] who performed as a comedian; [[Richard Clayderman]], who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer [[Liberace]], who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.
==Well-known pianists==
A single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical, given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument.  Below are links to lists of well-known or influential pianists divided by genres:

==Amateur pianism==
[[File:Johnny_Hahn_January_2012.JPG|thumb|225px|An amateur pianist playing outdoors at [[Pike Place]] market in [[Seattle]].]]
Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of ''amateur pianists'' all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreas|first1=Møller|title=Professionel pianist leverer dinnermusik til jeres fest af højeste klasse|url=http://www.pianomusic.dk/|website=Pianomusic.dk|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs]], held annually in [[Paris]], attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

It is notable that [[Jon Nakamatsu]], the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]] for professional pianists in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist [[Davide Martello]] is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst|title=Paris attacks: pianist 'drove 400 miles through the night' to pay tribute|first=Jonathan|last=Bucks|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds''' is a [[fictional character]] in the novels ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bUaYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;dq=Athos+three+musketeers+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r-elmbv8YG&amp;sig=XIZ8CzRUu9QwhPkbsSP4qzXBRks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzDCVNTiC8yVatPIgIAJ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Athos%20three%20musketeers%20analysis&amp;f=false|title=The Social Psychology of Communication|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other two [[musketeer]]s, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Aramis]], are friends of the novel's protagonist, [[d'Artagnan]].

In ''The Three Musketeers'' his [[family name]] is du Vallon. In ''Twenty Years After'', having made a financially advantageous marriage, he is first known as du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=20 Years After|publisher=The World's Classics|isbn=0-19-283074-0|pages=110–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he earns the title of [[Baron]].

Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers. His eating abilities even impress [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] during a banquet at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. As the story advances, he looks more and more like a giant, and his death is that of a [[titan (mythology)|titan]].

At the time of ''The Three Musketeers'' (ca. 1627) he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from. He was finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer's somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing and later married) to equip himself for the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].

The fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical [[musketeer]] [[Isaac de Porthau]].

'''Robert Olen Butler''' (born January 20, 1945) is an American fiction writer. His short-story collection ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life==
Butler was born in [[Granite City, Illinois|Granite City]], Illinois, to Robert Olen Butler Sr., an actor and theater professor who became the chairman of the theater department of [[Saint Louis University]], and his wife, the former Lucille Frances Hall, an executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler attended [[Northwestern University]] as a theater major ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1967) and switched to [[Playwright|playwriting]] at the [[University of Iowa]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]], 1969).

Butler served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] from 1969 to 1971, first as a [[counter-intelligence]] special agent for the [[United States Army|Army]] and later as a translator. He rose to the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the Army [[Military Intelligence Corps]]. His experiences during that period have informed his writings, and as a result, in 1987 Butler received the Tu Do Chinh Kien Award from the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] for outstanding contributions to American culture by a veteran. "My greatest pleasure in life was at 2 in the morning to wander out into the steamy back alleys of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], where nobody ever seemed to sleep, and just walk the alleys and crouch in the doorways with the people," Butler told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993. "The Vietnamese were the warmest, most open and welcoming people I've ever met, and they just invited me into their homes and into their culture and into their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Applebome, "An Author Catapulted into the Foreground," ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a steel mill laborer, a taxi driver, and a substitute teacher in high schools in the years following his tour of duty in Vietnam, Butler joined [[Fairchild Publications]], where he worked on the staffs of trade publications such as ''Electronic News''. From 1975 until 1985, he was the editor-in-chief of Fairchild's ''Energy User News'' (now ''Energy &amp; Power Management'').&lt;ref&gt;It is now a publication of [[BNP Media]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Robert Olen Butler is the author of 12 novels and six short story collections, including ''A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain'', which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In a review for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, renowned author Claire Messud wrote, "The book has attracted such acclaim not simply because it is beautifully and powerfully written, but because it convincingly pulls off an immense imaginative risk. . . . Butler has not entered the significant and ever-growing canon of Vietnam-related fiction (he has long been a member)—he has changed its composition forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Messud|first=Claire|title=Voices of Vietnam|newspaper=Guardian (London)|date=June 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler began writing novels on the Long Island Railroad while working as a publicist for Fairchild Publications. "Every word of my first four published novels was written on a legal pad, by hand, on my lap, on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] as I commuted back and forth from [[Sea Cliff, New York|Sea Cliff]] to [[Manhattan]]," Butler has said about his early writing.&lt;ref name=Powells&gt;

The author's first novel was ''[[The Alleys of Eden]]'', which was published in 1981 by Horizon Press after being rejected by 21 publishers.&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt; Its protagonist is an American deserter who decides to stay in Vietnam, as Butler's one-time writing professor [[Anatole Broyard]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "because, with all its troubles, Vietnam seems to him to retain more of its integrity, its sense of self, than the America he has left behind."&lt;ref name=TimesReview&gt;

  |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the publication of ''The Alleys of Eden'', Butler had written, by his estimation, "five ghastly novels, about forty dreadful short stories, and twelve truly awful full-length plays, all of which have never seen the light of day and never will."&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt;

Butler has always been a controversial artist, seemingly reinventing himself with each new novel or short story collection. His shape-shifting often polarizes reviewers, as was the case with Butler's second novel ''Sun Dogs'' (Horizon, 1983), which ''The New York Times'' described as having "some powerful moments, some engrossing scenes and deft touches, but there is little momentum, no satisfying pattern, none of the magic of synergy."&lt;ref name=TimesReview/&gt; Conversely, the ''Ft. Worth Star-Telegram'' lauded the book as "full of power and energy...mov[ing] from the most feverish of prose to a flatness and sparseness that is reminiscent of the best of Chandler and Hammett. And most importantly, he has something to say... Butler is an intelligent novelist who cares about his characters. He is skillful enough to make the reader feel the same way. It is not often that we get the chance to witness the birth of something this important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Ronald|title=Now See What He's Done for an Encore|newspaper=Ft. Worth Star-Telegram|date=November 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler's stories have appeared in such publications as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', and ''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]''. He has had stories included in a combined twelve editions of ''[[Best American Short Stories|The Best American Short Stories]]'', ''[[New Stories From the South]]'', and numerous college literature textbooks. Butler has also written screenplays for film and television, most of them based on other writers' material.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler's short-story collections ''Tabloid Dreams'' (1996) and ''Had a Good Time'' (2004) take their inspiration from popular culture. The stories in ''Tabloid Dreams'' were spun from the titles of outlandish articles in supermarket tabloids. ''Had a Good Time'' builds its narratives around the images on vintage American picture postcards, which Butler has collected for more than a decade. One example is the tale "Mother in the Trenches", first published in ''Harper's'' in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Butler. {{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/archive/2003/02/0079484|date=February 2003|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Mother in the Trenches|work= Harper's Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the journey of Mrs. Jack Gaines, a prosperous matron, from her comfortable home to the battlefields of [[World War I]] France, in order to convince her soldier son to come home; the story's basis is a period postcard that depicts a stout, middle-aged woman wearing dark clothes and a cloche hat.

Again the critical response varied dramatically. While the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that the stories "feel like a literary parlor game,"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, John. {{cite news|url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/08/22/RVGH889K2R1.DTL|date= August 22, 2004|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Faces look out from postcards to inspire stories|work= The San Francisco Chronicle | first=John | last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boston Globe'' raved that it was full of "crisp writing, marvelous imagining, the discussion of large, existential questions that are as central to life now as they were a hundred years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merullo|first=Roland|title=A Past's Captured Souls|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Severance,'' his 2006 collection of 240-word short stories about the post-beheading thoughts of decapitated individuals (from [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] to [[Louis XVI]] to the author himself) was the basis of ''Severance'', a one-act play by [[David Jette]]. It was produced in 2007 at McCadden Place Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Butler described ''Severance'' as his best and most ambitious book.&lt;ref&gt;

This was the first of an extended venture into defining and exploring the short short story form.  His companion collection, ''Intercourse'', comprising 100 very short stories, revealed the inner monologues of couples (often famous) engaged in sexual intercourse. ''Weegee Stories,'' presenting the inner monologues of the subjects of 60 iconic photographs of Arthur "Weegee" Fellig, continued his interest in the form.  He also published a theory of the short short story in ''[[Narrative Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Robert Olen|title=A Short Short Theory|url=http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2009/short-short-theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As further evidence of his predilection for self-reinvention, in 2009 he published ''Hell'', a "roaring satire"&lt;ref name="Seaman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seaman|first=Donna|title=Review|newspaper=Booklist|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a novel set entirely in the underworld. His 2011 novel, ''A Small Hotel'', is described by Donna Seaman of ''Booklist'', the American Library Association's magazine, as a "sexy novel of psychological suspense."  She goes on to say, "Butler executes a plot twist of profound proportions in this gorgeously controlled, unnerving, and beautifully revealing tale of the consequences of emotional withholding."&lt;ref name="Seaman"/&gt;

In still another act of reinvention, Butler publishes his first literary/historical/espionage/thriller, ''The Hot Country'', with Otto Penzler's ''[[Mysterious Press]]'' in the fall of 2012.

In 2001, Butler wrote in real-time, a complete short story, "This is Earl Sandt," from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions. As the author explained of the broadcasts, "What we're trying to do here is reproduce for you what is normally hidden behind the veil of private life.".&lt;ref&gt;

Butler taught creative writing from 1985 to 2000&lt;!-- Not positive about this year--may be 2001. --&gt; at [[McNeese State University]] in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], with his colleague [[John Wood (poet)|John Wood]], to whom he dedicated ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]''. He then joined the faculty of [[Florida State University]] as a Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor, holding the [[Michael Shaara]] Chair in Creative Writing, where he currently teaches.

==Awards and honors==
Butler is a recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in fiction and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant, and was a finalist for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]. In 2001 he won a [[National Magazine Award]] for "Fair Warning," a short story that was published in the journal ''Zoetrope: All-Story'', and, four years later, he won another National Magazine Award for "The One in White," a short story published in ''The Atlantic Monthly''.

In 1993, his first story collection, ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]'', won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction. ''The New York Times'' praised the book's "startling, dreamlike"&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">'''SCOPE Art Show''' (also known as just SCOPE and SCOPE Art Fair) is a contemporary art fair held annually in [[New York City]], [[Miami]], and [[Basel]]. The art fairs, which focus on young galleries and emerging art, each include between 60 and 100 exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=What to See at SCOPE Basel in 2016|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/scope-basel-preview-2016-506105|accessdate=18 October 2016|publisher=Art Net|date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
SCOPE was founded by artist and gallerist Alexis Hubshman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vazquez|first1=Neil|title=Scope Founder Alexis Hubshman Talks Art Basel Trends for the Season|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/scope-founder-alexis-hubshman-talks-art-basel-trends-for-the-season-7997175|accessdate=18 October 2016|publisher=Miami New Times|date=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first art fair was held at New York’s Gershwin Hotel. SCOPE began as an international exhibition of 28 galleries, curators, and art organizations. Each exhibitor featured one emerging artist.

In 2004, SCOPE New York expanded to feature 65 international exhibitors and included the new Culture on the Verge Party to open the fair. In addition to the continuing Miami, New York, and Los Angeles fairs, SCOPE added a fair in London at the Melia White House in [[Regent's Park|Regents Park]] in 2004. In 2005, SCOPE included [[the Hamptons]] and [[Venice]] in its program. In 2007, SCOPE Basel was held for the first time at E-Halle.

== Collector Mentorship Auction ==
The Collector Mentorship Auction, created by artist Lilah Freedland for Scope, allowed young collectors to further their knowledge of the art field by bidding on mentorship hours with established collectors. The silent auction took place at Fairs in Miami, New York, and The Hamptons. Young art collectors from the Whitney Contemporaries, the Guggenheim Museum’s Young Collectors Council, the Core Club, and the Soho House, among others, bid for the opportunity to work with more experienced collectors such as [[Beth Rudin DeWoody]], Warhol collaborator [[Bob Colacello]], Enrique Norten, Jed Walentas, and Brooklyn Museum director Arnold Lehman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orden|first1=Erica|title=Up for Bid at Scope Hamptons: Collector Mentorship|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/up-for-bid-at-scope-hamptons-collector-mentorship/82508/|accessdate=18 October 2016|publisher=New York Sun|date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sauwastika swastika comparison.svg|thumb|274px|Comparison between left-facing "sauwastika" and right-facing "swastika"]]

The term '''''sauwastika'''''  (or ''sauvastika''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika - Hindu Symbols |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576371/swastika |title=swastika (symbol) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1935-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (as a character: 卍) is sometimes used to distinguish the left-facing from the right-facing [[swastika]] symbol, a meaning which developed in 19th century scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;In use from the 1850s, certainly so used by D'Alviella (1894) "[[sauvastika]]" is used to classify the geometrical form  of symbols in Liungman, Carl G., ''Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms'', HME Publishing (2004) {{ISBN|91-972705-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-facing variant is favoured in [[Bön]] and [[Gurung Dharma]]; it is called ''yungdrung'' in Bon and ''Gurung Yantra'' in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; however, the ''left-facing'' is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanskrit.org/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-swastika/ |title=What is the meaning of a Swastika? |publisher=Sanskrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika is imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika Symbol in Buddhism - Buddhist Swastika |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swastikaphobia.com/buddhist.html |title=Buddhist - The Swastikaphobia Project |publisher=Swastikaphobia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/~bmori/syll/315syll/Swastika.html |title=Swastika |publisher=Cla.calpoly.edu |date=1935-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhas-online.com/swastika.html |title=The Swastika or WAN Symbol in Asian Art - The Heart of Buddha |publisher=Buddhas-online.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Sanskrit]] ''sauvastika'' is the adjective derived from ''svastika'' through the standard process of [[vṛddhi]] of the vowel ''u'' in the initial syllable.   (''Svastika'' is the transformation of "su asti" + "ka" through [[sandhi]].  Vrddhi applies to the original form before sandhi.)  It is attested as an adjective meaning "benedictive, salutatory".&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Horace Hayman Wilson|Wilson]] (1819), cited by [[Monier-Williams]].&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to a "reversed" ''svastika'' is probably first made by  [[Eugène Burnouf]] in 1852, and taken up by [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]] in ''Ilios'' (1880), based on a letter from [[Max Müller]], who is in turn quoting Burnouf. The term ''sauwastika'' is used in the sense of "backwards swastika" by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]] (1894): "In India it [the ''[[gammadion]]''] bears the name of ''swastika'', when its arms are bent towards the right, and ''sauwastika'' when they are turned in the other direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/sym/mosy/mosy06.htm#page_40 ''The Migration of Symbols''], by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]], (1894), p.40 at [[sacred-texts.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been misspelled as ''suavastika'', a term attributed to Max Müller by Wilson (1896).
Wilson  finds that "The 'suavastika' which Max Müller names and believes was applied to the swastika sign, with the ends bent to the left ... seems not to be reported with that meaning by any other author except Burnouf."&lt;ref&gt;On Oriental Carpets. Article III.—The Svastika, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs (1903) also uses the term with reference to Müller.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of a distinction in Indian religions==
[[Image:buddhistswastika.jpg|thumb|225px|"Left-facing" swastika on a Buddhist temple in [[Korea]].]]
[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|frame|Left-facing swastika from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'']]
[[Eugene Burnouf]], the first Western expert on Buddhism, stated in his book ''Lotus de la bonne loi'' (1852) that the ''sauvastika'' was a Buddhist variant of the ''svastika''.

When [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered swastika motifs in [[Troy]], he wrote to the Indologist [[Max Müller]], who, quoting Burnouf, confirmed this distinction, adding that "the ''svastika'' was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the ''sauvastika'', and, therefore, a natural symbol of light, life, health, peace and wealth." The letter was published in Schliemann's book ''Ilios'' (1880):
{{quote|"In the footprints of Buddha the Buddhists recognize no less than sixty-five auspicious signs, the first of them being the Svastika ..." (Eugene Burnouf, ''Lotus de la bonne loi'', p. 625); “the fourth is the sauvastika {{sic}}, or that with the arms turned to the left.”}}

The term ''sauvastika'' thus cannot be confirmed as authentic and is probably due to Burnouf (1852).  Notions that sauwastikas are considered "evil" or inauspicious versions of the auspicious swastika in [[Indian religions]] have even less substance, since even Burnouf counts the svastika and the sauvastika equally among the "sixty-five auspicious signs".

D'Alviella (1894) voices doubts about the distinction:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Would it not be simpler to admit that the direction of the branches is of secondary importance in the symbolism of the gammadion?  When it is desired to symbolize the progress of the sun, namely, its faculty of translation through space, rather than the direction in which it turns, little attention will have been paid to the direction given to the rays. (p. 68)}}

Although the more common form is the right-facing swastika, the symbol is used in both orientations for the sake of balance in [[Hinduism]]. Buddhists almost always use the left-facing swastika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Use==
The sauwastika was a favorite symbol of the last Russian Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. She put this sign everywhere for good luck. In particular, she drew it with a pencil on the wall, at the window opening, and on the wallpaper above the bed of her son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]] in [[Ipatiev House]], where the murdered Emperor's family spent the last days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Gilliard]]. Thirteen Years at the Russian Court&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation''''' ({{lang-zh|t=冥王聖幀}}, literally "Sacred Scroll of the King of the Underworld") is a [[Yuan dynasty]] [[silk painting|silk]] [[hanging scroll]], measuring 142 × 59 centimetres and dating from the 13th century, with didactic themes: a multi-scenic narrative that depicts Mani's Teachings about the Salvation combines a sermon subscene with the depictions of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] teaching in the rest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Mani's-Pictures"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2015 |title=Mani's Pictures: The Didactic Images of the Manichaeans from Sasanian Mesopotamia to Uygur Central Asia and Tang-Ming China |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill Publishers |page=245 |isbn=9789004308947 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was regarded as a depiction of the [[Desire realm|six realms]] of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] by [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhists]], therefore it was called "Painting of the Six Paths of Rebirth" ({{lang-ja|六道図}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kintetsu-g-hd.co.jp/culture/yamato/shuppan/binotayori/pdf/168/2009_168_5.pdf |title=「六道図（大和文華館）」をめぐって |date=2009 |website=kintetsu-g-hd.co.jp |language=ja |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being studied by scholars like {{ill|Takeo Izumi|ja|泉武夫 (美術史学者)}}, {{ill|Yutaka Yoshida (linguist)|lt=Yutaka Yoshida|ja|吉田豊 (言語学者)}}, [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]] and [[Jorinde Ebert]], they concluded that the painting is a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ma |first=Xiaohe |date=2014 |title=霞浦文書研究 |trans-title=A Study of the Xiapu Manichaean Manuscripts |url=http://img.univs.cn/webfile/event/2015/6/15/293/1434333823741_3143072.pdf |location=Lanzhou |publisher=Lanzhou University Press |language=zh-Hant |page=35 |isbn=9787311046699}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably produced by a 13th-century painter from [[Ningbo]], a city located in southern China,&lt;ref name=A-Visual-Sermon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/28628966/_A_Visual_Sermon_on_Mani_s_Teaching_of_Salvation_A_Contextualized_Reading_of_a_Chinese_Manichaean_Silk_Painting_in_the_Collection_of_the_Yamato_Bunkakan_in_Nara_Japan._Studies_on_the_Inner_Asian_Languages_23_2008_1-16 |title=A Visual Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation: A Contextualized Reading of a Chinese Manichaean Silk Painting in the Collection of the Yamato Bunkakan in Nara, Japan |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2008 |website=academia.edu |access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is kept today in the [[Museum of Japanese Art|Museum of Japanese Art Yamato Bunkakan]] in [[Nara, Nara]].

== Description ==
The painting is divided into five scenes, with titles given by [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]], a Hungarian specialist on Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6173/2966 |title=Searching for Mani's ''Picture-Book'' in Textual and Pictorial Sources |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2011 |publisher=Heidelberg University Publishing |accessdate=27 November 2018 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Light Maiden's Visit to Heaven'': the first section at the top depicts heaven as a palatial building that forms the focus of a narration of events with the repeated images of a few mythological beings: the Maiden of Light visiting the heaven. It shows on the left the greetings by the host of heaven upon the arrival of Maiden of Light, meeting with the host in the palace in the middle and the Maiden leaving heaven on the right.
* ''Sermon Around a Statue of Mani'': the second scene is the main section and largest among the five, it depicts a sermon performed around the statue of a Manichaean deity ([[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]) by two Manichaean elects dressing in white on the right. The elect giving the sermon is seated, while his assistant is standing. On the left seated the layman dressing in red and his attendant, listen to the sermon.
* ''States of Good Reincarnation'': the third section is further divided into four small squares, each portraying one of [[Four occupations|four classes of Chinese society]] in order to capture what seems to be the daily life of the Chinese Manichaean laity. From left to right, the first scene represents itinerant labourers; the second, craftsmen; the third, farmers, and the fourth, aristocrats.
[[File:Daênâ with Her Attendants (Manichaean Sermon).jpg|thumb|left|Detail: Maiden of Light on a cloud formation with her attendants.]]
* ''The Light Maiden's Intervention in a Judgement'': the fourth scene shows a judge seated behind a desk surrounded by his aides in a pavilion on an elevated platform, to the front of which two pairs of demons lead their captives to hear their fates. In the upper left corner, the Maiden of Light arrives on a cloud formation with two attendants, to intervene on behalf of the man about to be judged. This section is a depiction of the Manichaean view of judgement after death. The French historian [[Étienne de la Vaissière]] compared the judgement scene with that displayed on the [[Sogdia]]n [[Tomb of Wirkak|Wirkak]]'s sarcophagus, and concluded that they are strikingly similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/20031662/_Wirkak_Manichaean_Zoroastrian_Khurram%C3%AE_On_bilingualism_and_syncretism_in_Sogdian_funerary_art_Papers_in_Honour_of_Professor_Yutaka_YOSHIDA_and_Professor_Masaharu_ARAKAWA_on_Their_60th_Birthday_Studies_on_the_Inner_Asian_Languages_30_2015_p._95-112 |title=Wirkak: Manichaean, Zoroastrian, Khurramî? |last=La Vaissière |first=Étienne de |author-link=Étienne de la Vaissière |date=2015 |website=academia.edu |page=100 |access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''States of Bad Reincarnation'': the final scene depicting four fearful images of hell that include, from left to right, a demon shooting arrows at a person suspended from a red frame in the upper left corner; a person hung upside down and being dismembered by two demons; a fiery wheel rolled over a person; and lastly a group of demons waiting for their next victims.

== Analysis ==
Zsuzsanna Gulácsi states in her article ''A Visual Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation'': {{Quote|text=The [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] origin of this Chinese painting is unquestionable for three principal reasons: its dedicatory inscription that bestowed the object on a [[Chinese Manichaeism|Chinese Manichaean]] temple most likely at [[Ningbo]], in [[Zhejiang]] province; the iconography of its main deity, [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], as well as that of the elect (Manichaean priests), who are shown in Chinese versions of characteristically Manichaean attire; and the significant amount of documentary evidence on the worship of Manichaean deities (Mani and [[Jesus]]) represented in pictorial and sculptural forms by the Manichaean communities of southern China, especially [[Fujian]] and Zhejiang provinces, between the 10th and 17th centuries. […] This hanging scroll is clearly not a devotional work of art that was used for the purposes of religious worship. It is dominated by a narrative character displayed throughout its complex pictorial program that relies on a large set of uniquely arranged individual scenes. Although the sequence of the scenes is logical, it is not self-evident. Their comprehension implies a beholder familiar with Manichaean religious teaching. We have seen that various compositional elements, just as a comprehensive theme, unite the individual registers (scenes) into this intricate image that is hardly suitable for casual viewing. Therefore, this silk painting can be best interpreted as a didactic work of art designed as a visual aid for religious instruction. If so, this painting constitutes a prime example of such an image that was used by a Manichaean community in ca. 13th-century southern China, possibly in the region of Ningbo, in Zhejiang province.&lt;ref name=A-Visual-Sermon /&gt;}}

'''The Society of Painters in Tempera''' was founded in 1901 by [[Christiana Herringham]] (1852–1929) and  a group of British painters who were interested in reviving the art of [[tempera]] painting.  Lady Herringham was an expert copyist of the Italian [[Old Masters]] and had translated ''Il Libro dell' Arte o Trattato della Pittura'', [[Cennino Cennini]]'s fifteenth-century handbook on [[fresco]] and tempera.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lago.

:''For the Scottish Society of Women Artists, see [[Visual Arts Scotland]].''
The '''Society of Women Artists (SWA)''' is a British art body dedicated to celebrating and promoting fine art created by women.

It was founded as the '''Society of Female Artists''' (SFA) in about 1855, offering women artists the opportunity to exhibit and sell their works. Annual exhibitions have been held in London since 1857, with some wartime interruptions.

== History ==
Particularly during the 19th century, the British art world was dominated by the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy (RA)]], founded in 1768. Two of the 34 named founders were women painters: [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1741–1807) and [[Mary Moser]] (1744–1819).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/striving-after-excellence-victorian|title="Striving after excellence": Victorian women and the fight for arts training – Blog – Royal Academy of Arts|website=www.royalacademy.org.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1922 that other female artists were admitted to the academy. [[Annie Swynnerton]], a member of the Society of Women Artists since 1889, was elected as the first female associate member of the Royal Academy and in 1936, [[Dame Laura Knight]] became the first female elected full member of the Royal Academy. 

A woman's place in society was perceived as passive and governed by emotion. And in the 1850s, the idea that women could be artists was hotly debated by John Ruskin and other critics in various journals. Ruskin wrote to Sophia Sinnett in 1858 "You must resolve to be quite a great paintress; the feminine termination does not exist, there never having been such a being as yet as a lady who could paint.”&lt;ref&gt;''Cook and Wedderburn, The Life, Letters and Complete Works'', London, 1903 etc., vol. 14, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were not considered as serious contributors to the field of art and had great difficulty in obtaining a public showing. Their education in the arts was limited and they had been excluded from the practice of drawing from the nude figure since the Royal Academy was founded. However, Ruskin later revised his opinion of women artists after seeing [[Elizabeth Thompson]]'s ''The Roll Call'' at the Royal Academy in 1874. After much debate and petitioning, in December 1883, the Royal Academy Schools agreed to provide life classes "for the study of the partially draped figure" to female students but it was a further 10 years before women were admitted to these classes. It was at this time that life classes for women were becoming more widely available across the country. 

Nevertheless, British women artists proved themselves capable of working both individually and in collaboration and consequently, gained greater credibility. In order to progress and find opportunities to exhibit, they began to form their own organisations. One of the most significant of those bodies was the '''Society of Female Artists''', founded around 1855. Initially, membership was granted to women who had exhibited with the Society and who earned their livelihood through art.

===Society of Female Artists (c. 1855 – c. 1869)===

In 1855, English biographer [[Harriet Grote]] (1792–1878) and opera singer [[Jenny Lind]] (1820–1887) were cited as founder members of the SFA, with the society's first headquarters located at the [[Architectural Association]] in Conduit Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Elizabeth, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866–1928'', Routledge, 1999, p253 &lt;/ref&gt; The society was initially managed by a committee, and, although its members were sometimes listed in early catalogues, no presiding officer was ever named. Early members included [[Rosa Bonheur]] and Elizabeth Thompson.&lt;ref name="jisc.ac.uk"&gt;https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/files/womensart/0031.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's first exhibition, held at 315 Oxford Street, London between 1 June and 18 July 1857, became the focus of debate with regard to the role of women in art. The exhibition comprised 358 works by 149 female artists, the predominant genre being landscapes. In May 1857, prior to the opening, ''[[The Art Journal]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'' were supportive of the exhibition. The then secretary stated in ''The Art Journal'' (1 June 1857): "The Committee are (sic) gratified to announce that the success of their first Exhibition has fully exceeded their expectations”.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, Pamela Geraldine, ''The Mid Victorian Woman Artist 1850–1879'', PhD Thesis, University College London, 1982, p167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Society then held annual exhibitions in London showing work of women artists (except in the years 1912–1914, 1919 and 1940–1946). 

Until 1863, the annual exhibition received controversial reviews, probably as exhibits were chosen on a liberal and amicable basis. This was addressed in 1865, when their lack of professionalism led to a reorganisation of the Society under the patronage of the Duchess of Cambridge and consequently it was renamed the '''Society of Lady Artists'''.&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/archives/unit/ARC61705|title=V&amp;A Archives|website=www.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has received royal patronage since 1865 (the current patron is [[HRH Princess Michael of Kent]]).

In 1867 Mrs. [[Madeline Marrable]], a prolific watercolourist and oil painter, joined the committee.

=== Society of Lady Artists (c 1869 – 1899) ===
The Society's earliest records were lost or destroyed during [[World War II]] at the Society's headquarters at 195 Piccadilly, London (the Society's catalogues and remaining papers dating from 1929 are now housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] Library). As a result, there is some debate as to exactly when the Society was renamed from the SFA to the SLA. Secondary sources of reference suggest 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/history.html|title=History|website=www.society-women-artists.org.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources suggest it was 1873.&lt;ref name="jisc.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/society-women-artists|title=Society of Women Artists – Artist Biographies|website=www.artbiogs.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Marrable became the first president of the society. In 1899, the mid-Victorian persona was discarded and the 20th century was embraced by the society with a new name, the '''Society of Women Artists''' (SWA).

=== Society of Women Artists (1899 – present) ===

The society has had many notable artists among its members. Dame Laura Knight, the first woman Royal Academician, was elected president in 1932 and retained that office until she retired in 1968 to become a Patron.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Orr, Clarissa, ''Women in the Victorian Art World'', Manchester University Press, Manchester &amp; New York, 1995, p55&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrator [[Mabel Lucie Atwell]] and Suzanne Lucas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/tamlyn-and-son/catalogue-id-2772909/lot-7213053|title=Biography Suzanne Lucas  (1915 &amp;#8211; 2008) M.B.E Medaille de la France  FLS PRMS FPSBA SWA HSF|first=|last=the-saleroom.com|website=www.the-saleroom.com|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; past President of the Society of Botanical Artists and the first woman president of Royal Miniature Society (now known as [[Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers]]), were also members. Current members include [[Daphne Todd]], the first female President of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]] from 1994–2000 and winner of the [[BP Portrait Award]] 2010, portraitist [[June Mendoza]], and [[Philomena Davidson]], first woman President of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]].
 
Many SWA members are also members of other well-established societies, such as the [[Royal Society of British Artists]], the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]], [[The Pastel Society]], and the [[Society of Equestrian Artists]].

The SWA collated a four-volume dictionary of the society's exhibitors to 1996. The society's archive was given to the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]’s Archive of Art and Design in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Baile De Laperriere, Charles, ''The Society of Women Artists exhibitors 1855–1996 : a dictionary of artists and their works in the annual exhibitions of The Society of Women Artists'', 4 volumes, Hilmarton Press, Wiltshire, c1996, p5, {{ISBN|0-904722-30-9}} {{ISBN|978-0-904722-30-7}} http://www.lutterworth.com/pub/dictionary%20women%20artists%20intro.pdf retrieved 02-01-2017&lt;/ref&gt; Only the RA and the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] produce such records. Today, the mechanics of running the society can be viewed on their [http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/ website].

== Membership ==

Membership of the SWA is composed of a maximum of 150 members. They promote new artists and encourage non-members to show their work at their annual exhibition.

The first step towards becoming a member is to submit six works regularly (although a maximum of four will be hung) for the Annual Open Exhibition. These are considered by a selection committee, and if judged exceptional, the artist is elected to become an associate member (ASWA), subject to space within the society. Associate members become eligible for election to full membership in the following year.

[[File:Voer_Kirke_(Rougsø)_Vest.JPG|thumb|Stilt tower with three arches of Voer Kirke, [[Norddjurs Kommune|Northern Djursland]], [[Denmark|DK]]]]
The '''Stilt tower''', in Danish "styltetårn", is a special type of Medieval church tower, concentrated in [[Djursland]] peninsula and neighbouring regions of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Jutland]].

In this type, only the upper storey with the bells has four walls. The lower parts of such a tower are formed by one or three high arches. With one arch, the lower part of the tower, which is connected to the western gable of the [[nave (architecture)|nave]], is only open to the west. With three arches, the lower part is a high open hall.

Very few ''stilt towers'' were built after Gothic age, if 20th century constructions with a box for the bells on high pilars are kept out of regard. And very few stilt towers were built in the Middle Ages in distant regions, where the term is unknown.

Gerardo Murillo Cornado, was the real name of the artist known as [[Dr. Atl]]. He was an avid researcher of nature, and he is considered to be the ideologist of the Muralist Movement, since he imposed a style that was later absorbed by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, José Chávez Morado, among other renowned artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cultura.gob.mx/noticias/artes-plasticas-y-fotografia/28545-gerardo-murillo-el-dr-atl-expreso-a-traves-de-diversas-disciplinas-su-pasion-por-las-artes-y-la-ciencia.html|title=Gerardo Murillo, el Dr. Atl|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=www.cultura.gob.mx|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atl began his studies in art at the workshop of Felipe Castro and finished at the Academy of San Carlos. In addition to his penchant to the plastic arts, he became interested in literature, and wrote stories, novels, poetry and even wrote his own biography ''Profane People in the convent'' [''Gentes profanes en el convento''], 1950, in which he described his passion for nature as well as the Mexican landscape: ''nothing has ever provoked in me a feeling as deep as walking for three or four days to reach the high slopes of a mountain, settle amongst them in a cave or in a makeshift hut, and draw pleasantly as nature appeared before my eyes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museo Soumaya.Fundación Carlos Slim, Tomo II|last=Palhares Meza|first=Héctor|publisher=Museo Soumaya.Fundación Carlos Slim|year=2015|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=480|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his travels through the mountains and volcanoes of Mexico he took inspiration for his paintings such as ''Sunlight between the Mountains'' [''Rayos de sol entre la sierra''], where he found the telluric force for expressive landscape validating it through color and violent strokes, which would become the guidelines for modern painting in Mexico. The study of these new insights led him to create the technique called aeropaisaje or which consists in the reproduction of full views taken from a helicopter where he made his reconnaissance trips.

'''Talehunt''' is a community that allows people to write, read, and post very [[short stories]]. It is available as a [[mobile app]] (the TaleHunt App) on both Android and iPhone mobile platforms. In Talehunt, any user can create an account and post [[Narrative|stories]], [[fan fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://creativepathwaysfiction.blogspot.in/2015/10/tale-hunt-microfiction-under-250.html|title=Tale Hunt: Microfiction under 250 characters|last=Bennett|first=E.R.G.|date=2015-11-06|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poetry|poems]], which are under 250 characters in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily-iowan.com/2016/02/01/few-characters-but-characters/|title=FEW CHARACTERS, BUT CHARACTERS |last=Flair|first=Justus|date=2016-02-01|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows anyone to write very short "tales" (also known as Stories) and build a fanbase of followers, giving people the chance to have their creative works available to a wider audience. This will also help new and upcoming writers to get an audience for their creative writing.&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyuw.com/arts_and_leisure/article_bb5d4a78-ca31-11e5-96d6-f3810282f36e.html|title=TaleHunt App to promote very short stories|last=Reese|first=Madelyn|date=2016-02-03|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://englishinlife.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/can-you-write-a-story-with-250-characters/|title=CAN YOU WRITE A STORY WITH 250 CHARACTERS? |last=Saglam|first=Ridvan|date=2015-11-06|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who likes to read microstories can follow good writers in Talehunt to view all their upcoming stories. Tales in Talehunt may include that of undiscovered writers, published writers, new writers, and aspiring writers. Around 55% of Talehunt users are from the United States, and the rest are from various parts of the world, including Europe and Asia.

== History ==
The early beta version of Talehunt was available by the end of 2015. The app was officially released January 2016.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;

== Design ==
The app has a minimalist design which is simple&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://issuu.com/underthefable/docs/final_copy_-/25?e=17481284/31672631|title=Test Driving the App|last=Ward|first=Adam|date=2015-11-01|work=Publishers Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in its logo: a quill and a scribble on a dark green background.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt; The dark green theme is intended to make the TaleHunt App user-friendly and pleasant to read. Once in the app, even before logging in, the user can immediately read other users' short stories and follow the writer if the user liked the tale. Once followed, all stories will show up in the personal timeline, which is customized for each user based on the people he or she follows. Each author also has their own page, which includes their username, profile photo, follow button, number of followers, number of users followed, and a feed of all of the author's stories.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;

'''''Tele-rugby'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tele-rugby at Youtube|

url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQzZztzV18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003) is a 10-minute [[video art]] project created by [[Genco Gulan]]. The film features two female teams inside a swimming pool, fighting each other over a television, and pushing the television around. Tele-rugby was presented in [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro]].

''Tele-rugby'' is filmed underwater with professional swimmers. Despite what the title may suggest Tele-rugby is not about a sports match but it is about a love and hate relationship with media and especially TV. It depicts the fight for the screen in a new environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">"'''The Haunted Palace'''" is a [[poetry|poem]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The 48-line poem was first released in the April 1839 issue of [[Nathan C. Brooks|Nathan Brooks']] ''[[American Museum (Brooks magazine)|American Museum]]'' magazine. It was eventually incorporated into "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" as a song written by Roderick Usher.

==Analysis==
The poem serves as an [[allegory]] about a king "in the olden time long ago" who is afraid of evil forces that threaten him and his palace, foreshadowing impending doom. As part of "The Fall of the House of Usher", Poe said, "I mean to imply a mind haunted by phantoms — a disordered brain" &lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. Cooper Square Press, 2001. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Roderick Usher.

The poem takes a marked change in tone towards the second to last stanza. After discussing the wit and wisdom of the king, and song and beauty in the kingdom:

:''But evil things, in robes of sorrow,''
:''Assailed the monarch's high estate.''

The house and family are destroyed and, apparently, become phantoms.

The beginning of the poem compares the structure with a human head. For example, the windows are eyes, its door representing a mouth. The exterior represents physical features while the interior represents the mind engaged in imaginative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, Richard. "The House of Poe," collected in ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967: 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
In 1845, [[Thomas Dunn English]] claimed Poe had tried to sell "The Haunted Palace" to [[John L. O'Sullivan]] of the ''[[The United States Magazine and Democratic Review|Democratic Review]]'' but was rejected because he "found it impossible to comprehend it".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight &amp; David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1987: 587. {{ISBN|0-7838-1401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if this is true. The poem was published in the April 1839 issue of the ''Baltimore Museum''.&lt;ref name=Sova104&gt;Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. Checkmark Books, 2001: 104. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], a known rival of Poe's, claimed that Poe had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] the poem from [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s "Beleaguered City". Poe denied that charge and suggested that Longfellow had, in fact, plagiarized from him.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Sidney P. ''Poe's Literary Battles: The Critic in the Context of his Literary Milieu''. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969: 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "The Haunted Palace" was one of the poems highlighted in Griswold's ''[[The Poets and Poetry of America]]'', one of the first [[anthology|anthologies]] of American poetry in 1842.&lt;ref name=Sova104/&gt; When the poem was reprinted by the ''New World'' in 1845, Charles Eames introduced it as exquisite. "We can hardly call to mind in the whole compass of American Poetry, a picture of more intense and glowing Ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1987: 498. {{ISBN|0-8161-8734-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1904, French composer [[Florent Schmitt]] wrote an [[etude]], ''Le palais hante'', derived from "The Haunted Palace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/99_2000season/1999_10_15/schmitt.cfm AmericanSymphony.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the poem provided the title for a [[Roger Corman]] film of the [[The Haunted Palace|same name]]. The actual plot of Corman's film ''The Haunted Palace'' comes almost entirely from ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'', a novel by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. By 1963, Corman had produced several highly lucrative films based on Poe's work, but Lovecraft  was not at that time a well-known author; according to Corman on the DVD making-of featurette, the studio forced him to name this movie after one of Poe's poems (and included a Poe epigraph in the credits) so that audiences would believe it to be another film based on Poe's writings.

In 1987, Bulgarian rock band [[Shturcite]] released a song, "Omagiosaniyat zamuk". The song's lyrics are a translation of ''The Haunted Palace'' into Bulgarian but, in 1990, when the track was released on the compilation ''The Crickets'', the track title was back-translated into English as "The Haunted Castle".

In 2009, Lithuanian contemporary classical music composer Giedrius Alkauskas wrote an [[Art song]] for a bass singer and a piano, based on the translation of "The Haunted Palace" into Lithuanian made by Aleksys Churginas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bernardinai.lt/straipsnis/2011-04-26-giedrius-alkauskas-i-sapnu-ir-burtu-lauka/61863 (in Lithuanian, [[Bernardinai.lt]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GawyXCCIfm4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ways of Seeing''''' is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer [[John Berger]] and producer [[Mike Dibb]]. It was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. 

The series was intended as a response to [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon, and the series and book criticize traditional [[Western culture|Western cultural]] [[aesthetics]] by raising questions about hidden [[ideology|ideologies]] in visual images.

| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|08|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The first part of the television series drew on ideas from [[Walter Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' arguing that through reproduction an [[Old Master]]'s painting's modern context is severed from that which existed at the time of its making.

| ShortSummary    = The second film discusses the female [[Depictions of nudity|nude]]. Berger asserts that only twenty or thirty nudes in the European oil painting tradition depict a woman as herself rather than as a subject of male idealisation or desire.

| ShortSummary    = In the fourth programme, on publicity and advertising, Berger argues that colour [[photography]] has taken over the role of oil paint, though the context is reversed. An idealised potential for the viewer (via [[consumerism|consumption]]) is considered a substitution for the actual [[reality]] depicted in old master portraits.
