      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P. ''After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989–2007''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salih|first1=Sara|title=Judth Butler|date=2002|page=63|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

The '''[[Adysh]] [[Gospels]]''' (Adishi [[Four Gospels]]) ({{lang-ka|ადიშის ოთხთავი}}) is an important early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gospel Book]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 

[[Image:Canon - Adysh Gospels.jpg|left|thumb|100px|A Georgian reproduction of the Canon table by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].]] 

The oldest dated extant [[manuscript]] of the Georgian version of the [[Gospels]], it was created by [[Mikaeli]] at [[Shatberdi Monastery]] in the southwestern Georgian princedom of [[Klarjeti]] (located now in northeastern [[Turkey]]) in AD 897, and later removed thence to be preserved in the remote village of [[Adysh]] (Adishi) in highland [[Svaneti]]. The first five folios (30 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm) of the [[Illumination (manuscript)|manuscript are illuminated]].

The manuscript was first published, in 1916, by the prominent Georgian scholar [[Ekvtime Takaishvili]]. It has been extensively studied by both Georgian and international scholars (e.g., [[Robert Pierpont Blake]] of [[Harvard University]]). The manuscript is now preserved in the [[Mestia]] Ethnographic Museum, Georgia.

== Text ==

It lacks text of [[Christ's agony at Gethsemane]] (Luke 22:43–44), and [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|pericope of the adulteress]] (John 7:53-8:11), [[Mark 16|Longer Ending of Mark]] (Mark 16:9–20), the tradition of an angel who stirred the waters at the Pool of Bethesda (John 5:4), necessity for praying to Jesus(John 14:14), parable of two men in the field (Luke 17:36), Jesus' remark about his listeners (Mark 7:16), Jesus' speech about cutting sinful feet (Mark 9:44, 46), and Jesus' advice to forgive sins to others (Mark 11:26), Jesus' remark about people who do not go without prayer or fasting (Matthew 17:21), and one of Jesus' condemnatory sentences towards Scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 23:14); Thus providing the only (but earliest) Georgian witness for the omission of these passages.

The gospel also has some interesting variants. For example in both Matthew 19:24 and Mark 10:25 the text reads "rope" instead of traditional "camel".

==Plot==

The satirical film spoofs several recent pop cultural [[It Girl]] moments such as Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction and Ashlee Simpson's lip synching fiasco. It has also been called an African American ''[[Red Shoe Diaries]]''.{{citation needed |date=March 2013}}

==Director==
{{Off topic |Venus Hottentot |section |date=March 2013}}

''Afrodite Superstar'' was directed by art filmmaker [[Venus Hottentot]].

Venus Hottentot is a feminist art school graduate who wanted to make a film that showed positive sexual representations of women of color to directly contrast the images in pop culture music videos, films and magazines, while also employing comedy and satire.  She chose the name Venus Hottentot to reclaim the spirit of a South African woman, also called [[Saartjie Baartman]], who was sexually displayed and exploited in Europe.  The film quotes [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[bell hooks]], and the director has been called the [[Zane (erotica author)|Zane]] of filmmaking.  Venus Hottentot does not use the word "porn" to describe ''Afrodite Superstar'' as this term is misleading for this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.edenfantasys.com/sex-toy-reviews/media/afrodite-superstar |title=Sex toys reviews – AfroDite Superstar - Erotic video - Erotic and educational media |publisher=Edenfantasys.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, the film has drawn ire from those seeking to use it for pornographic purposes as porn/ audience arousal was not the director's mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/index.php?sid=1458607 |title=TruMix.com : PodcastDirectory.com : Professor P's P4NORAMA Podcast |publisher=PodcastDirectory.com |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an [[African American]] filmmaker, her objective with this project was reclaiming the voice and expression of women of color, as well as raising sexual self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venushottentot.com |title=Afrodite Superstar |publisher=Venushottentot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venus Hottentot has been identified as TV host/novelist and art film maker [[Abiola Abrams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abiolaabrams.com/id54.html Abiola Abrams' Film Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154226/http://www.abiolaabrams.com/id54.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arts and Humanities Research Council''' ('''AHRC''') was established in April 2005 as successor to the Arts and Humanities Research Board and is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]]; [[non-departmental public body]] that provides approximately £102 million from the [[UK government|government]]  to support [[research]] and postgraduate study in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]], from languages and law, archaeology and English literature to design and creative and performing arts. In any one year, the AHRC makes approximately 700 research awards and around 1,350 postgraduate awards. Awards are made after a rigorous peer review process, to ensure that only applications of the highest quality are funded.

==Recently funded research==

===Stonehenge Riverside Project===

The [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] is a major five year AHRC-funded archaeological research study interested in the development of the [[Stonehenge]] landscape in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. In particular, the project is interested in the relationship between the stones and surrounding monuments and features including; The River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. In August 2009 the project discovered a new stone circle, which was named [[Bluestonehenge]] by the research team, about one mile away from [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. The project is run by a consortium of university teams.  It is directed by Prof. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University, with co-directors Dr Josh Pollard (University of Southampton), Prof. Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Dr Kate Welham (Bournemouth University) and Dr Colin Richards (Manchester University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2009/1363.html |title=News releases 2009 |work=shef.ac.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Soldier Database===

Researchers at the University of Reading and University of Southampton analysed historic sources such as muster rolls records in the National Archives at Kew and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (for records of English garrisons in France). The resulting Medieval Soldier online database enables people to search for soldiers by surname, rank or year of service.  The online database contains 250,000 service records of soldiers who saw active duty in the latter phases of the Hundred Years' War (1369–1453).

===Old Bailey Proceedings Archive===

An AHRC research grant enabled academics from the [[University of Hertfordshire]], [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[Open University]] to double in size the [[Old Bailey]] trial proceedings available to view on the Old Bailey Proceedings Online website and provide access to the largest single source of searchable information about ordinary British lives and behaviour ever published.

The Old Bailey Proceedings Online makes available a fully searchable, digitised collection of all surviving editions of the Old Bailey Proceedings from 1674 to 1913, and of the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]'s Accounts, 1679 to 1772. It allows access to over 197,000 trials and biographical details of approximately 2,500 men and women executed at [[Tyburn]].

==History==

In 2005 the AHRC replaced the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Creating the AHRC: An Arts and Humanities Research Council for the United Kingdom in the Twenty-first Century (Oxford UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comb over''' or '''combover''' is a [[hairstyle]] commonly worn by [[bald]] or balding men in which the [[hair]] is grown long and [[comb]]ed over the bald area to minimize the appearance of baldness. Sometimes the part is lowered so that more hair can be used to cover the balding area.

In Japan, men with comb overs are called "bar code men" (バーコー"人), referring to the similarity between the striations caused by the comb and the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on products. The "barcode style" is called "bākōdo na kamigata" (バーコードな髪型).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Tokyo |author= Yonekawa, Akihiko (Editor)|title= Slang Dictionary |edition=3rd | date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Russia this hairstyle is often humorously referred to as "internal loan" (внутренний заём) for resemblance to the corresponding [[Internal debt|economic practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=В.С. Елистратов|title=Словарь русского арго (Dictionary of Russian slang)|date=2002|url=http://gramota.ru/slovari/argo/53_1713}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Combover patent.jpg|thumb|upright|A variant of the comb over was [[patent]]ed in 1977.]]
==Patent==
On May 10 1977, Donald J. Smith and his father, Frank J. Smith, of [[Orlando, Florida]], were awarded a patent ({{US patent|4022227}}) for their variation of the comb over that conceals baldness by combing long hair in three separate directions.

In between the comb-over  and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">A '''creative work''' is a manifestation of [[creativity|creative]] effort including [[Work of art|fine artwork]] ([[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[drawing]], [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[performance art]]),  dance, writing ([[literature]]), [[filmmaking]], and [[music|musical composition]].

Creative works require a creative mindset and are not typically rendered in an arbitrary fashion although some works demonstrate [have in common] a degree of arbitrariness, such that it is improbable that two people would independently create the same work. At its base, creative work involves two main steps—having an idea, and then turning that idea into a substantive form or process.  The creative process can involve one or more individuals.  Based upon technological advances as well as artificial intelligence there is the possibility that creative works can be created without human intervention - thereby removing the step of "having an idea".  Typically the creative process has some aesthetic value which is identified as a creative expression which itself generally invokes an external stimuli which a person views as creative.
The term is frequently used in the context of [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford|first1=Law Library|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-basics/|website=Fair Use|publisher=Stanford Libraries|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
For the purpose of section 221(2)(c) of the [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], the expression "creative works" means: 
{{quote|(a) literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, or &lt;br/&gt;(b) designs,&lt;br/&gt;created by the taxpayer personally or, if the qualifying trade, profession or vocation is carried on in partnership, by one or more of the partners personally.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/5/section/221 section 221(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Superwork ==
A '''superwork''' is a creative work that contains multiple creative works all derived from the same originating work.&lt;ref&gt;{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P50|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}, ''{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P1476|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}'' ([https://books.google.fr/books?id=r0iBW7fygu8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true extract])&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the superwork from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' could comprise the original text, [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|the Little Mermaid statue]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989 film), commentaries, etc.

In the context of [[Semantic Web]] the superwork was standardized as "[http://schema.org/CreativeWork CreativeWork] container", so it is a ''CreativeWork'' with many [http://schema.org/hasPart hasPart] relations with other ''CreativeWork''.

'''''Crucifixion''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Giovanni Bellini]], created around 1455–1460. It is housed in the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice]].

The work was originally in the church of [[San Salvador, Venice|San Salvador]] of Venice, and is part of the [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]-influenced phase of Bellini's early career.

==Description==
The painting shows the crucified Jesus, portrayed with a very pale skin, on a broad landscape background. The deep blue sky is populated by [[cherubim]]s who are weeping his death. In the lower part are Mary and St. John. 

The background shows several details, including a lake with a wooden bridge, a quarry, small houses and a series of small working figures. Such a fragmented, detailed composition was typical of [[Jacopo Bellini]], the artist's father, and was replaced by a more coherent one in Bellini's later works. Other elements typical of his early works are the rather crude painting strokes, the thin figures and the sharp lines.

'''Day in the life''' (or '''a day in the life''', or '''day in the life of''') is a [[genre]] of [[storytelling]] in which the events occurring in the life of the subject or subjects are those occurring in single day of their life. 

Such storytelling is sometimes used as a form of [[journalism]], where "[a] day-in-the-life story records the activities of someone through a period of time—such as the length of a day. The videojournalist shoots everything in hopes of capturing revealing details".&lt;ref name="Kobre"&gt;Kenneth Kobre, ''Videojournalism: Multimedia Storytelling'' (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre can be used to give the reader or viewer the sense of a typical day in the life of the subject without actually taking a day to present this material:

{{quote|A film such as 'A Day In the Life of...' does, however, demonstrate one very important point. Though the passage of time can itself be the theme of the story, film time is not real time. A day in the life of an animal is presented in thirty or fifty minutes of film time. The film is a compressed, a speeded-up, account of a day. Yet the moving pictures of which the film is composed—the shots themselves—happen in real time. A shot of a ten-second event must last ten seconds. Even when slowed down or speeded up, we perceive the film time as if it were real time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kriwaczek, ''Documentary for the Small Screen'' (2016), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although a day in the life story may present a distinct crisis arising and being dealt with, "some of the writers of these stories feel they are an exploration into the human condition and relationships, that a day in the life of a character, without a Climax and Resolution, is just as valid a storytelling model".&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Lynn Schmidt, ''Story Structure Architect'' (2005), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A "day in the life" story could therefore also be a [[slice of life]] story, depicting the routine events of the life of the subject, although a slice of life story is not necessarily restricted to events occurring in the course of a single day.&lt;ref name="Kobre"/&gt;

The '''''Dutch interiors''''' are a series of three paintings painted by [[Joan Miró]] in 1928, each inspired by [[Dutch Golden Age]] paintings of Dutch interiors. ''Dutch Interior I'' is a reinterpretation of the ''Lute Player'' by [[Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh]], ''Dutch Interior II'' is a reinterpretation of ''[[Children Teaching a Cat to Dance]]'' by [[Jan Steen]], and ''Dutch Interior III'' is a reinterpretation of the ''Young woman at her toilet'', also by Steen. They belong to a Mirós' period called "assassination of painting".
In the Spring of 1928, during a trip to Belgium and Holland, Miró was impressed by the [[Dutch master]]s of the 17th-century. After buying colorful postcards of some paintings he began his ''reinterpretations''. The colors are the hues of the original paintings, but the intensity of the color is purely Miró. Thus, a green-gray gradient wall of Martensz Sorgh becomes a green apple in Miró.

==''Dutch Interior I''==

This painting presents a scene where the lute player stands in the centre. A woman besides him looks at the partiture, near a table. Under the table, a cat and a dog are playing. These domestic components contrast with the landscape of Amsterdam which is seen through a window.

It includes the same degree of detail shown in ''[[The Farm (Miró)|The Farm]]'', with nowaday objects&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Maria Malet, Joan Miró , Barcelona, Edicions 62 , 1992 ( {{ISBN|84-297-3568-2}} )&lt;/ref&gt; as the basket of the house. The huge size of the main elements, as the lute, corresponds to its importance in the scene and not to its real size or the proportions of the original picture. This ability to break the model by distorting the images (mainly sizes and shapes of the objects) is a key characteristic of Miró's style.&lt;ref&gt;Pesquero, Saturnino. Joan Miró: la intencionalidad oculta de su vida y obra. Erasmus Ediciones, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It doesn't go never very far away from the Flemish model. As Miró reported "I had the postcard pinned up on my easel while I painted"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A4016&amp;page_number=13&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Painting's Description at Moma]&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours belong to the same hue as in the original painting but with a greater intensity. They are pure and flat colours, not mixed ones, with special attention to green, white and brown.

==''Dutch Interior II''==

In this painting there are some repeated elements, like the dog and the cat, who dance with a group of children. The subject is not a description or a realistic work, but the music and the sound. Two red eyes are watching the scene and they foresse the fantasy touch of the third one, so the three paintings can be seen as a progressive series. Blue and brown are the main colours of the interior, while the cat serves as the spinning force of the whole composition.

It shows the aim of Miró to perform what it was called antipainting, influenced by Dada and Marcel Duchamp. When he takes a famous painting and transforms it, he is recognizing his debt with the model while he destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;Dupin, Jaques, Miró, Flammarion, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Miró is questioning his own previous work.

==''Dutch Interior III''==

The third painting of the series differs from the other two because, despite of being inspired by a domestic scene of a Flemish model, it changes the subject: the main character is a woman who isn't taking a bath but giving birth to a goat. This woman is impaled by a nail to the floor and is framed by a black line, one of the typical colours of Miró.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz, Jesús et al., Miró, Tikal, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The cruelty of the scene is softened by the stylization of the details,&lt;ref&gt;Dupin, Jacques, Miró, Flammarion, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although the red of the blood makes it harder, attracting the attention of the viewer.

'''''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem''''' is an 1125 [[fresco]] by the [[Master of San Baudelio de Berlanga]], originally located at [[San Baudelio de Berlanga]] but now on display in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts [[Christ]] and seven [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] entering [[Jerusalem]] to the acclaim of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This fresco is in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style popular in northern [[Spain]] during the twelfth century. The life-size figures, extending the entire height of the fresco, are marked by curvilinear patterning, schematic drapery folds, and repeated figures creating abstract designs.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, riding an ass and her foal, raises his hands to bless the multitudes come to greet his arrival. These multitudes have been condensed to two kneeling figures spreading branches before him.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
San Baudelio was constructed in the eleventh century, but the frescoes were not added for another century. There are two distinct cycles: the upper walls were covered in colorful scenes from Christ's life, while the lower walls depicted hunt scenes and exotic animals indicative of the [[Islamic]] influence in the region.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; While the two sets of images have very different subjects, there are many indications that they were created simultaneously, by artists from the same atelier if not the very same artist. The frescoes have a similar quality of line, and the draftsmanship of various human and animal figures seems related. They were also created using the same techniques: initial sketches in [[buon fresco]] and [[fresco-secco]], details added in [[tempera]], polished with [[limewater]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John P.|title=The Art of Medieval Spain: A.D. 500-1200|year=1993|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=0870996878|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdXQnaME1gMC&amp;pg=PA228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although seemingly at odds, the two sets of frescoes, religious and secular, worked together quite well considering the time and place of their creation. The unstable border between Christian and Muslim regions saw much interpenetration of ideas and people. The [[Mozarab]]ic people in the region, who practiced Christianity with the trappings of Arab culture, would have been ideally served by San Baudelio's mixture of cultures and iconographies.&lt;ref name=garnett/&gt;

===Location history===
The remoteness of [[Berlanga de Duero]] and inaccessibility of its church helped the frescoes survive for centuries, protecting them from everything but the weather.&lt;ref name=day/&gt; In 1927, the villagers of Berlanga sold the frescoes that had not been destroyed to an art dealer named Leon Levi. They were then dispersed to museums around the world, including the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], and the [[Prado Museum]].&lt;ref name=garnett&gt;{{cite web|last=Garnett|first=Rachel|title=The Fresco Paintings of San Baudelio|url=http://www.unt.edu/honors/eaglefeather/2005_Issue/2005_PDFs/Garnett.pdf|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The IMA acquired ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'' in 1957 as a gift of G. H. A. Clowes and Elijah B. Martindale. It was given the accession number 57.151 and hangs in the Irving M. Fauvre Gallery by its sister fresco, ''Marriage at Cana''.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry of Christ into Jerusalem|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/entry-christ-jerusalem-master-san-baudelio-de-berlanga|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie compiles interviews from gamers, developers, journalists to show how pervasive sexist behavior is in the gaming world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/culture/2015/06/18/docfest-film-reviews-playing-games-with-top-spin-and-gtfo/|title=DocFest film reviews: Playing games with ‘Top Spin’ and ‘GTFO’|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|first=John|last=Angelico|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's premiere at South by Southwest was met with primarily favorable reviews, with critic Dennis Harvey commenting: "Several other documentaries are currently in the works on the same subject, and many will no doubt be a lot slicker than 'GTFO.' But the rough edges of Sun-Higginson’s Kickstarter-funded feature lend it an ingratiating, unpretentious modesty, and its lack of rancor on a topic that might’ve easily supported a more sensationalist approach can only be a plus in reaching male gamers most in need of its wake-up call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-gtfo-get-the-f-out-1201458625/|title=‘GTFO’ Review: An Entertaining, Accessible Look at Misogyny in the Videogaming World - Variety|author=Dennis Harvey|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''gajasimha''''' or '''''gajasiha''''' (from {{lang-sa|gaja+siṃha|script=Latn}} / {{lang-pi|gaja+sīha|script=Latn}}) is a [[mythical hybrid]] animal in [[Hindu mythology]], appearing as a ''sinha'' or ''rajasiha'' (mythical lion) with the head or trunk of an elephant. It is found as a motif in Indian and Sinhalese art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bane |first1=Theresa |title=Encyclopedia of beasts and monsters in myth, legend and folklore |date=2016 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786495054 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used as a heraldic symbol in some Southeast Asian countries, especially [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]]. In Siam (pre-modern Thailand), the ''gajasimha'' served as the symbol of the ''[[kalahom]]'', one of the king's two chief chancellors. It appears as a [[supporter]] in the [[coat of arms of Siam]], in use from 1873 to 1910, and the [[royal arms of Cambodia]], officially adopted in 1993.

Godzilla's contemporaries included Godzookie, and the Barnstormers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The original members of Godzilla were [[Tomie Arai]], Ken Chu, [[Karin Higa]], Arlan Huang, [[Byron Kim]], Bing Lee, Colin Lee, Janet Lin, Mei-Lin Liu, Margo Machida, Stephanie Mar, Yong Soon Min, Helen Oji, Eugenie Tsai, Charles Yuen and Garson Yu.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|last=Chang|first=Alexandra|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0195335791|editor-last=Marter|editor-first=Joan M.|location=|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 24, 1914|title=Karen Higa (1966-2013)|url=http://artforum.com/passages/id=45076|journal=ARTFORUM|last1=Joselit|first1=David|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Godzilla's members were previously involved in [[Basement Workshop]] and [[Asian American Arts Centre|Asian American Art Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/330442/a-brief-history-of-the-art-collectives-of-nycs-chinatown/|title=A Brief History of the Art Collectives of NYC’s Chinatown|last=Wong|first=Ryan|date=February 7, 2017|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members decided to name the organization "Godzilla" after Japanese movie monster [[Godzilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-ken-chu-1|title=Interview with Ken Chu, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective organized "slide slams" where hundreds of artists had the opportunity to display their work as well as view other artists' works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2014|isbn=1466854650|location=|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godzilla also published a national newsletter that included member-written opinion pieces, coverage of Asian American art from across the United States, and calls for artwork. Because Godzilla members rejected formally becoming a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)3 organization]], rotating volunteer committees coordinated much of its work. The Godzilla logo and newsletters were designed and produced by Charles Yuen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Other notable artists and arts professionals who later joined Godzilla include artists [[Paul Pfeiffer (artist)|Paul Pfeiffer]], [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Nina Kuo]], [[Allan deSouza]], and art critic Alice Yang.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Whitney Biennial Protest ===
In the spring of 1991, members of Godzilla published a letter highlighting the historic absence of Asian American artists in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s [[Whitney Biennial|Biennial]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/arts/art-expressing-the-hyphen-in-asian-american.html|title=ART; Expressing the Hyphen in 'Asian-American'|last=Karmel|first=Pepe|date=1995-04-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/identity-politics-that-forever-changed-art.html|title=The Reviled Identity Politics Show That Forever Changed Art|date=2016-04-21|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective chose to call attention to this absence in part because of the Whitney Biennial's influence in establishing trends in the American art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-margo-machida-1|title=Interview with Margo Machida, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Godzilla's letter, Whitney Museum director David Ross met with Godzilla members Tsai, Machida, Pfeiffer and others to discuss plans to expand minority representation the Whitney's curatorial staff, which was intended to in turn improve the representation of minority artists in the Whitney's future biennials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tsai was subsequently appointed as a curator at the Whitney in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4650">'''Hysterical realism''', also called '''recherché postmodernism'''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}, is a term coined in 2000 by English critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] to describe what he sees as a [[literary genre]] typified by a strong contrast between elaborately absurd prose, plotting, or characterization, on the one hand, and careful, detailed investigations of real, specific social phenomena on the other.

Wood introduced the term in an essay on [[Zadie Smith]]'s ''[[White Teeth]]'', which appeared in the July 24, 2000 issue of ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, "[https://newrepublic.com/article/61361/human-all-too-inhuman Human, All Too Inhuman]," ''The New Republic Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Wood uses the term to denote the contemporary conception of the "big, ambitious novel" that pursues "vitality at all costs" and consequently "knows a thousand things but does not know a single human being."

He decried the genre as an attempt to "turn fiction into social theory," and an attempt to tell readers "how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something." Wood points to [[Don DeLillo]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]] as the forefathers of the genre, which continues, Wood says, in writers like [[David Foster Wallace]]. In response, [[Zadie Smith]] described ''hysterical realism'' as a "painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own ''White Teeth'' and a few others [Wood] was sweet enough to mention".&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Zadie |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,568381,00.html |title=This is how it feels to me |publisher=The Guardian |date=2001-10-13 |accessdate=2007-03-21 }} and  [https://www.webcitation.org/5clsv4qWf?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/oct/13/fiction.afghanistan archived.]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith qualified the term, though, explaining that "any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna".

Wood's line of argument echoes many common criticisms of [[postmodernist]] art generally. In particular, Wood's attacks on DeLillo and Pynchon clearly echo similar criticisms other critics had already lodged against them a generation earlier. The "hysterical" prose style is often paired with "realistic"—almost journalistic—effects, such as Pynchon's depiction of 18th century [[Public Land Survey System|land survey]]s in ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'', and [[Don DeLillo]]'s treatment of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] in ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]''.

'''''In a Glass Cage''''' ({{lang-es|'''Tras el cristal'''}}) is a 1986 Spanish  [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Agustí Villaronga]], and starring [[Günter Meisner]], [[Marisa Paredes]] and David Sust.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 193"&gt;Schwartz, ''The Great Spanish Films Since 1950'', p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the history of [[Gilles de Rais]],&lt;ref name="Foster 183"&gt;Foster, ''Spanish writers on gay and lesbian themes'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; the plot follows an ex-Nazi [[child molestation|child molester]] who is now paralyzed and depending on an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] to live. A young man who comes to nurse him was one of his former victims years before.

Due to themes mixing [[Nazism]], [[pedophilia]], [[torture]] and [[homosexuality]], the film was highly controversial.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 193"/&gt; To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[Teddy Award]]s, the film was selected to be shown at the [[66th Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2016.&lt;ref name="Panorama1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/panorama/pan-presse-detail_29908.html |title=Berlinale 2016: Panorama Celebrates Teddy Award's 30th Anniversary and Announces First Titles in Programme  |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=Berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Klaus, a former [[Nazi]] doctor, practiced horrific, [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] experiments on children during [[World War II]]. After the war, he goes into exile in a remote village in [[Catalonia]], where he continues to rape and torture young boys. He kills his latest victim with a blow to the head, taking photographs of the crime. Angelo, one of Klaus' victims, spies on him from a window, and steals incriminating writings and photographs of the doctor's crimes. Klaus tries to commit suicide by jumping from a tower. He survives, but he is left paralyzed and unable to breathe on his own, confined permanently in an iron lung to survive.  
                                                                                             
Some years later, Klaus is being taken care of by his wife Griselda and their young daughter Rena in a large gloomy house in the country. Griselda is unhappy in Spain and, overwhelmed by the task of looking after her husband, secretly wishes he would just die. Angelo appears, offering his services as a nurse to help take care of Klaus. Griselda takes an instant dislike towards Angelo and does not want to hire him, but Klaus insists that he should stay. In reality, Angelo has no actual nursing skills, which Griselda soon discovers, but even then Klaus refuses to get rid of him. Angelo's true aim is revealed to be not only to take his revenge out on Klaus, but to ultimately take his place as a torturer. Angelo reads Klaus passages from the diaries he stole in which the doctor describes, in detail, how he tortured his victims. Recreating what Klaus did to him, Angelo strips and masturbates in front of Klaus. He then calls Griselda. She tries to run away, but he kills her, hanging her from the rails of the second floor.

The next day, Angelo fires the housekeeper, taking over the house with Rena's help. Rena is not disturbed by her mother's absence, as Griselda was abusive towards her. Rena feels far more comfortable under Angelo's care. Angelo continues with the doctor's experiments, bringing young boys to Klaus in his iron lung. Angelo lures a child to the house and ties him to a chair. In front of Klaus, Angelo kills the boy by injecting him through the heart with a needle filled with gasoline. He brings in another boy, forces him to sing and kills him by cutting his throat. Fearing that Angelo will kill him and Rena, Klaus tells his daughter to run away to the near village with a message asking for help.

Angelo discovers Rena while she is trying to escape and brings her back to the house. He dominates her, assuming a perverse, violent "parental" role. Finally Angelo removes Klaus from his iron lung and lets him die of asphyxiation while emulating the scene of his own abuse, in Rena's presence. Once Klaus is dead, Angelo takes his identity totally, getting into the artificial lung, and makes Rena take his.

[[Image:ComynscarrVF.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"An Art Critic"&lt;br&gt;February 1893 caricature by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Joseph William Comyns Carr''' (1 March 1849 – 12 December 1916) was an English drama and art critic, gallery director, author, poet, playwright and theatre manager.

Beginning his career as an art critic, Carr was a vigorous advocate for Pre-Raphaelite art and a vocal critic of the "short-sighted" art establishment.  In 1877 he became a director of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] and promoting Pre-Raphaelite painters and other important exhibitors, such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  Ten years later he founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]].

Carr also wrote essays, books, plays, librettos, English-language adaptations of foreign works and stage adaptations of Dickens novels and classic tales like ''King Arthur'' and ''Faust''.

==Life and career==
J. Comyns Carr was born in [[Marylebone]], [[Middlesex]], England, the seventh of ten children.  His parents were Jonathan Carr, a woollen draper, and his Irish wife, Catherine Grace Comyns. Kate Comyns Carr, his sister, became a portrait artist; his brother Jonathan Carr developed the world's first garden suburb [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Casteras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbJBSpYc0_4C&amp;pg=PA184 p. 184, n. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Comyns Carr was educated at [[Bruce Castle School]], [[Tottenham]], [[Middlesex]], from 1862 to 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Esposito, Anthony.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46761 "Carr, Joseph William Comyns (1849–1916)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/46761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied law at the [[University of London]] and graduated in 1869, beginning to practise at the bar at the [[Inner Temple]], London.  He soon gave up law for a career in journalism and became drama critic for the ''Echo''.&lt;ref name=Whistler&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm Biography of Carr at the Whistler website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040615225011/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm |date=15 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 in [[Dresden]], Carr married author [[Alice Comyns Carr|Alice Laura Vansittart]] née Strettell (1850–1927), a novelist and designer. Alice designed the bold costume that [[Ellen Terry]] wore as Lady Macbeth, and in which [[John Singer Sargent]] painted her in 1889.  Sargent also painted Mrs. Comyns Carr in 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssgallery.org/Paintings/Mrs_JW_Comyns_Carr.html Painting of Alice Vansittart Comyns Carr]&lt;/ref&gt; and several portraits of her sister, [[Alma Strettell|Alma]], and illustrated Alma's ''Spanish and Italian Folk-Songs'' in 1897.  Carr and his wife had three children: Philip, Dorothy and [[Arthur Strettell Comyns Carr|Arthur]] (a [[barrister]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Carr was a member of the [[Arts Club]] and the [[Garrick Club]].  He published two memoirs: ''Some Eminent Victorians'' (1908), and ''Coasting Bohemia'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;Vansittart (1920) P.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr died of cancer at the age of 67 at his home in [[South Kensington]], London.  He was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]].

===Art career===
[[File:J-comyns-carr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carr in the 1910s]]
In 1873, Carr became an art critic for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''.  The same year, in ''The Globe'', he wrote a series of widely read articles about contemporary artists.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] took notice of these and befriended him.  Carr was a strong critic of the art establishment, decrying what he saw as its short-sightedness.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1875 He was engaged in 1875 by the influential French journal ''L'Art'' as its English editor.  In 1881–83, he founded and edited ''Art and Letters''.  As the first editor from 1883–86 of ''[[The English Illustrated Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote for a number of other journals including the ''Art Journal'', ''Saturday Review'', the ''Examiner'', the ''World'' and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr wrote books and articles about art championing the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] school of art, as well as monographic works on artists such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]] and [[Sir Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr and [[Charles Edward Hallé|Charles Hallé]] were appointed co-directors of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay.  The gallery promoted Pre-Raphaelite painters and exhibited provocative work.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[James McNeill Whistler]], Rossetti and Burne-Jones exhibited frequently at the Grosvenor Gallery.  In 1887, Carr and Hallé resigned from that gallery (which closed in 1890), after a dispute with Lindsay, and quickly founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], capturing Burne-Jones and most of the Grosvenor Gallery's other important artists.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr continued as co-director until 1908.  He also wrote the introduction to the British section of the 1911 International Exhibition of Fine Arts at Rome and later was chosen as the English representative to the Art Congress.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Theatre career===
Carr was also the author of dramatic works, beginning with several light comedies in the early 1880s for the [[German Reed Entertainments]] at [[St. George's Hall, London|St George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote numerous plays and adapted a number of French plays, such as ''Frou-Frou'', produced at the [[Princess's Theatre, London]] (1881); a stage adaptation of ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' co-authored with Thomas Hardy (1881); [[Hugh Conway]]'s ''Called Back'' (1884), which was very successful for the actor–manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]; ''Dark Days''; ''Boys Together''; ''In the Days of the Duke''; ''A Fireside Hamlet''; ''The United Pair''; ''The Naturalist'' (1887, an operetta with music by [[Charles King Hall]]); ''The Friar''; and ''Forgiveness''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; At the [[Haymarket Theatre]] from 1887 to 1893, Carr acted as Tree's literary adviser and partner.

[[Image:Carrcraven7.jpg|right|frame|Scene from ''King Arthur'']]
Carr leased the [[Comedy Theatre]] from 1893 to 1896.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; At the same time, his ''King Arthur'' (1895), a [[blank verse]] play inspired by the writings of [[Thomas Malory]] and [[Alfred Tennyson]], as well as by the visual images of the Pre-Raphaelites, was produced by [[Henry Irving]] in the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  It starred Irving and [[Ellen Terry]], with music composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and sets, costumes and artwork designed by Carr's friend Edward Burne-Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/king_arthur/index.html "King Arthur"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 10 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This spectacular production was a success for Irving and ran for over 100 performances, also touring North America.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another play that year was ''Delia Harding'', an adaptation of a [[Victorien Sardou]] play, at the [[Comedy Theatre]].  Also for Irving's company, in 1897 he produced an English version of ''[[Madame Sans-Gêne (play)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'' by Sardou and [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]] in 1897, which played on both sides of the Atlantic.  Carr also dramatised ''The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in 1910, starring [[H. B. Irving]] at [[Queen's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinamico.unibg.it/rls/stage.htm Information about Carr's version of ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr collaborated with [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and Arthur Sullivan on ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', an opera billed as a "romantic musical drama", at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1898. The Faustian theme was not what the Savoy audiences were used to, and the piece never found an audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html Information about ''The Beauty Stone''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110243/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's adaptation of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' was produced by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London (1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html Photo from ''Oliver Twist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204173319/http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html |date=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also produced on Broadway in 1905 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=7447 IBDB profile of Oliver Twist]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1904, after Irving transferred control of the Lyceum, Carr managed the theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr's ''Tristram and Iseult'' (1906), a pseudo-medieval drama, was produced at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] starring [[Matheson Lang]], [[Lily Brayton]] and [[Oscar Asche]].  An adaptation of Dickens' ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1907) was produced by Tree in Cardiff.  Carr's theory of the play was that Jasper, under the influence of opium, attempted to act upon his murderous impulses, but Drood, overhearing his uncle's ravings, was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/adaptations/39.html Information about Carr's ''Mystery of Edwin Drood'']&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an adaptation of Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', for Tree in 1908, in collaboration with [[Stephen Phillips]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the [[Royal Opera House]] in 1913–14, Carr was artistic adviser.  A fan of [[Richard Wagner]], Carr was responsible for the first English performance of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]'' in 1914 at Covent Garden.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''''Landscape near Arles''''' is an 1888 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts a rural scene in [[Provence]].&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Landscape near Arles'' depicts a very typical scene from that area: the farmhouse is a traditional [[Mas (Provençal farmhouse)|mas]], the [[cypress]] trees are common in the region, and the haystack is suitable for harvest time. Gauguin's treatment of the subject owes much to [[Paul Cézanne]], whom Gauguin revered. His emphasis on geometric forms and the way his careful network of precisely placed brushstrokes locks the haystack and farmhouse together creates a highly ordered environment that owes much to Cézanne.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way he organizes the traditional French countryside makes nature itself conform to his own structural regimen.&lt;ref name=day/&gt; Only the bright, acidic hues indicate that Gauguin was painting next to [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name=blog/&gt;

==Historical information==
For two months, ending on Christmas 1888, Gauguin and van Gogh lived together in [[Arles]]. Their stormy relationship cut short the partnership, and the period ultimately had little effect upon Gauguin's art.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Near Arles|url=http://gauguin-art.blogspot.com/2007/09/landscape-near-arles.html|publisher=Gauguin Art|accessdate=20 January 2013|date=25 Sep 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the clashing of their strong personalities, it was quite a productive period for them both. Van Gogh avidly wished to form an artistic enclave in the area, a desire that led to some mutual accommodation. This was the first painting Gauguin made during those months, on a linen canvas van Gogh stretched for him. The setting was one of van Gogh's favorites, the plains of the [[Crau]].&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

===Acquisition===
In February 1944, Mrs. Julian Bobbs purchased ''Landscape near Arles'' for the [[John Herron School of Art]] as a gift in memory of William Ray Adams, her first husband. The painting remained with the IMA during the division, and currently is on display in the Sidney and Kathy Taurel gallery. It has the acquisition number 44.10.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape near Arles|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-near-arles-gauguin-paul|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note''': ''Breathe Deeply'' and ''The Silver Crown'' were marketed under the ''[[Rage (collectible card game)|Rage]]''-Logo.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': ''Breathe Deeply'' makes use of the [[Amazon River|Amazonas]] setting, as detailed in the game supplement ''Rage across the Amazon'' (1993; {{ISBN|1-56504-061-9}}).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': ''Call to Battle'' was intended as first of a series about the main character (as written on the cover), but no follow-up was published. The book also makes use of material from the game line ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]''.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Note''': The Tribe Novel Series refers to the content of ''The Silver Crown'', while ''The Last Battle'' refers to the content of the Tribe Novel Series. Many of the main characters in those novels are considered signature characters of the game line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">The occult (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In common [[English language|English]] usage, ''occult'' refers to "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to "knowledge of the [[measurable]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as [[science]]. The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond [[Speculative reason|pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine''. Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company. (2004). ''The American Heritage College Thesaurus''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. Page 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C. F. (1895). An outline of the principles of modern theosophy. Boston: New England Theosophical Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural.

It also describes a number of [[magical organization]]s or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.

The '''''Maestà''''' is a painting by the Italian artist   [[Cimabue]], painted around 1280 and housed in [[Musée du Louvre]] of [[Paris]], [[France]].

==History==
It was acquired by the Louvre in 1813, as part of the Napoleonic spoiling of artworks in Italy, together with [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Stigmata of Saint Francis (Giotto)|Stigmata of St. Francis]]'', also from San Francesco.

==Description==
The work is considered to be from around 1280, thus preceding the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]''. It is also stylistically earlier to that work, being painted without pseudo-perspective, and having the angels around the Virgin simply placed one above the other, rather than being spatially arranged. The throne is similar to the ''Maestà'' painted by Cimabue in the [[Basilica of San Francesco di Assisi]] (1288–1292).

This work established a new canon for the Madonna with Child theme, which was subsequently used by other painters, such as [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] in his ''[[Rucellai Maestà]]''.

[[Image:Pena-medio-cut.JPG|thumb|300px| [[Pena Palace]] in [[Sintra]], [[Portugal]] one of the points of reference for Neo-Romantic architecture]]
The term '''neo-romanticism''' is used to cover a variety of movements in philosophy, literature, music, painting, and architecture, as well as [[social movement]]s, that exist after and incorporate elements from the era of [[Romanticism]]. It has been used with reference to late-19th-century composers such as [[Richard Wagner]] particularly by [[Carl Dahlhaus]] who describes his music as "a late flowering of romanticism in a positivist age". He regards it as synonymous with "the age of Wagner", from about 1850 until 1890—the start of the era of [[Musical modernism|modernism]], whose leading early representatives were [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=98–99, 102, 105}}. It has been applied to writers, painters, and composers who rejected, abandoned, or opposed [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]], or avant-garde modernism at various points in time from about 1840 down to the present.

== Late 19th century and early 20th century ==
Neo-romanticism as well as Romanticism is considered in opposition to naturalism—indeed, so far as music is concerned, naturalism is regarded as alien and even hostile {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=100}}. In the period following German unification in 1871, naturalism rejected Romantic literature as a misleading, idealistic distortion of reality. Naturalism in turn came to be regarded as incapable of filling the "void" of modern existence. Critics such as [[Hermann Bahr]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[Eugen Diederichs]] came to oppose naturalism and [[materialism]] under the banner of "neo-romanticism", demanding a cultural reorientation responding to "the soul’s longing for a meaning and  content in life" that might replace the fragmentations of modern knowledge with a holistic world view {{harv|Kohlenbach|2009|loc=261}}.

== Late 20th century ==
"Neo-romanticism" was proposed as an alternative label for the group of German composers identified with the short-lived ''[[New Simplicity|Neue Einfachheit]]'' movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Along with other phrases such as "new tonality", this term has been criticised for lack of precision because of the diversity among these composers, whose leading member is [[Wolfgang Rihm]] {{harv|Hentschel|2006|loc=111}}.

===1930–1955===
In British art history, the term "neo-romanticism" is applied to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s. It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''. These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

'''Ojo del Sol''', also called '''The Fish House''' by local residents, is a home designed in 1993 by architect [[Eugene Tssui]]. The building was constructed between 1994 and 1995 in a residential neighborhood of Berkeley California. The home’s name "Ojo Del Sol", Spanish for "Eye of the Sun", originates from the fifteen foot diameter eye-like window that faces south.&lt;ref name=WCA&gt;

The '''Oregon Shakespeare Festival''' ('''OSF''') is a regional [[Repertory|repertory theatre]] in [[Ashland, Oregon]], United States.  Each year, the Festival produces eleven plays, usually from three to five by Shakespeare and the remainder by other playwrights, on three stages during an eight-month season beginning in mid-February. From its inception in 1935 through the end of the 2017 season (excepting the war years 1941–1946) the Festival has presented all 37 of Shakespeare's plays a total of 312 times and beginning in 1960, 341 non-Shakespeare plays for a total of over 30,000 performances. It has completed the complete Shakespeare canon of 37 plays in 1958, 1978, 1997, and 2016.&lt;ref name="images"&gt;{{cite book | last=Leary | first=K. | title=Images of America: Oregon Shakespeare Festival | location=Charleston | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015. A complete list by year and theater is available at the ''Main article:'' [[Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]].

==Overview==
[[File:OSFAerialView.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Elizabethan and Bowmer Theatres during a "Green Show" (see below)]] A season at OSF consists of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays produced in three theatres. Three plays are staged  in the outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre, three in the Thomas Theatre, and five in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. OSF also provides a broad range of educational programs for middle schools, high schools, college students, teachers, and theatre professionals. While OSF has produced non-Shakespearean works since 1960, each season continues to include three to five Shakespeare plays.  Since 1935, it has staged [[List of Shakespeare plays|Shakespeare's complete canon]] three times, completing the first cycle in 1958 with a production of ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and completing the second and third cycles in 1978 and 1997.  Since 2000, there has also been at least one new work each season from playwrights such as [[Octavio Solis]] and [[Robert Schenkkan]].

Each year, the Festival offers 750 to 800 performances from February through late October or early November, to a total audience of about 400,000. The company consists of about 675 paid staff and 700 volunteers.&lt;ref name=Festival&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The People of OSF: Our Company Members | url=http://www.osfashland.org/about/people/index.aspx | publisher= Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gregio | first=Marcus | title=Shakespeare Festivals Around the World | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==Green Show==
In addition to the plays, beginning in 1951 a free outdoor "Green Show" drawing audiences of 600 to 1200, often including non-playgoers, has preceded the evening plays from June through October from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable wheelchair ramp for performers with disabilities, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities six days a week. Originally, it offered [[Elizabethan]] music and dancers. From 1966 till 2007, it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre.  Live music was supplied by the Terra Nova Consort and other guest musicians and modern dance was performed by Dance Kaleidoscope. In 2008, the Green Show was revamped. The nightly shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another. A fire show, juggler, or magician might be seen along with improv, metal, or rock-n-roll variations on Shakespeare. Individual performers, groups, choirs, bands, and orchestras may present Afro-Cuban, baroque, blues, classical, contemporary, cowboy, funk, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, mariachi, marimba, poetry, marionette, renaissance, or salsa, sometimes combined in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Show&gt;{{cite web | title= OSF Announces New Green Show | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/2008/0531/stories/0531_valley_greenshow.php| publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=2008-05-31 | accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | author=Varbel Bill. | title=Many Colors in Newly Revamped Green Show | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/2008/0609/stories/0609_greenshow.php| publisher= Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1893, the residents of Ashland built a facility to host [[Chautauqua]] events. In its heyday, it accommodated audiences of 1,500 for appearances by the likes of [[John Philip Sousa]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]] during annual 10-day seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Murphy | first=M. | title=The Stage is Set for a Meteoric Success. ''A Tradition of Shakespeare 1935–2005'' | work=Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a new domed structure was built at the site, but it fell into disrepair after the Chautauqua movement died out in the 1920s. In 1935, the similarity of the remaining wall of the  then roofless Chautauqua building to [[English Renaissance theatre#Theatres|Elizabethan theatre]]s inspired [[Southern Oregon University|Southern Oregon Normal School]] drama professor [[Angus L. Bowmer]] to propose using it to present plays by Shakespeare. Ashland city leaders loaned him a sum "not to exceed $400" (approximately equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|400|1935|r=-2}} in 2014) to present two plays as part of the city's [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration. However, they pressed Bowmer to add boxing matches to cover the expected deficit. Bowmer agreed, feeling such an event was in perfect keeping with the bawdiness of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theatre]], and the performances went forward. The [[Works Progress Administration]] helped construct a makeshift Elizabethan stage on the Chautauqua site,&lt;ref name="osfab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/about/archive/angus.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314043821/http://www.osfashland.org/about/archive/angus.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confidently billing it as the "First Annual Oregon Shakespearean Festival", Bowmer presented ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]]'' on July 2 and July 4, 1935, and  ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' on July 3, directing and playing the lead roles in both plays himself.&lt;ref name="osfab" /&gt; Reserved seats cost $1, with general admission of $.50 for adults and $.25 for children (approximately equivalent to $17, $8.50 and $4.25 in 2014). Ironically, the profit from the plays covered the losses the boxing matches incurred.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespeare Festival Archives.  Used with the permission of Amy Richard, Media Relations, OSF: media@osfashland.org&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Festival has continued ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II), and quickly developed a reputation for quality productions. Angus Bowmer's first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the Festival from 1935 to 1940 years.&lt;ref name="images"/&gt; In 1939, OSF took a production of  ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' to the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning at the last minute the broadcast would be to a national audience,  suffered a panic attack, was rushed to the hospital and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn't arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations and, after 1954 on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable review from critics and people began to come from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining the mystery of how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Darling | first=John | title=This is OSF...on NBC | work=Ashland Daily Tidings| date= August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bing Crosby]] served as an honorary director of the festival from 1949 to 1951. [[Charles Laughton]] visited in 1961, saying "I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen in my life." Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. [[Stacy Keach]] was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. [[Duke Ellington]] and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

1952 saw the birth of the tradition of closing the outdoor season with a ceremony in which many of company members enter the darkened theater carrying candles and a company member selected for the honor speaks Prospero's words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, "Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…" On completion of the speech all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The tradition of opening the outdoor season with a Feast of Will (initially the Feasting of the Tribe of Will) was initiated in 1956 in [[Lithia Park]] with [[Miss Oregon]] and then state senator [[Mark Hatfield]] attending.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]] approached OSF in the late 1970s about joining the art scene there, leading to the building of a new center in Portland. In 1986, OSF was again approached about producing in the new [[Portland Center for the Performing Arts]], leading to the launch in November 1988 of a season of five plays including Shaw's ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', the first of four productions that transferred to or from Ashland. At the invitation of the [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]], OSF established a resident theatre in the [[Portland Center for the Performing Arts]] in 1988 that spun off to independence in 1994 as [[Portland Center Stage]]. Those six seasons ran from November–April, allowing many company members to work in both cities. In 1990-1991 Portland imported rotating repertory from OSF, a company of 10 actors performing 43 roles.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

In 1986, the Festival received the President's Volunteer Action Award; in 1987 it initiated Daedalus, a fundraiser to help victims of HIV/AIDS that has continued annually ever since.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;
 
A second theatre, the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, enabling OSF to expand its season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000. [[Angus L. Bowmer]]retired in 1971, and leadership of the Festival passed to [[Jerry Turner (theater director)|Jerry Turner]], a respected actor/director and later a translator of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg]], who served as artistic director until 1991. He widened the Festival repertory to production of classics by the likes of Molière, Ibsen, and Chekhov. By 1976, the festival was filling 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the Festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year that Bowmer died, the Festival was producing 11 plays a season, the number that has been standard ever since. In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors' Association Award for distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The Oregon Shakespearean Festival was renamed the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1988. Turner retired in 1991 and actor/director [[Henry Woronicz]] took control from 1991 to 1996. When Woronicz left in 1996, OSF recruited [[Libby Appel]] from the highly respected [[Indiana Repertory Theatre]], and a guest director at OSF from 1988 to 1991. She served as Artistic Director from 1996 through 2007.  In 1997, the OSF-commissioned ''[[The Magic Fire]]'' was presented at the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts|John F. Kennedy Center]] and named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' among the year's best plays. In 2002, the Thomas Theatre (see below) replaced the Black Swan as the venue for small, experimental productions in a [[Black box theater|Black box theatre]]. In 2003, ''Time'' named OSF as the second best regional theatre in the United States (Chicago's [[Goodman Theater]] was first).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Zoglin | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Zoglin | title=Bigger than Broadway! | work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,454479-2,00.html |  date= May 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill Rauch as artistic director==
Current Artistic Director [[Bill Rauch]] succeeded Appel in 2008.  Rauch was the co-founder and artistic director of the [[Cornerstone Theater Company]] in Los Angeles and had been a guest director at OSF for six seasons prior to his appointment.  His vision includes making direct connections between classic plays and contemporary concerns, incorporating musicals into the annual selection of plays, exploring beyond the [[Western canon]] to incorporate Asian and African epics into the Festival, and reaching out to youth. While continuing to work with established playwrights, he has commissioned works by new ones, and has initiated the Black Swan Lab to develop new works for the stage. Each year, ten OSF actors are assigned to the Lab to work with Bill Rauch, OSF Dramaturg Lue Douthit, and Producer Sarah Rasmusen as one of their regular repertory assignments. In recognition of his work, he received the [[Margo Jones]] Award for his impact on American theatre in 2009 and the 2018 Ivy Behune Award from Actors Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=OSF's Bill Rauch honored by Actors' Equity for diversity efforts | work=Ashland Daily Tidings |url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20180124/osfs-bill-rauch-honored-by-actors-equity-for-diversity-efforts |  date= January 24, 2018 | accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bill Rauch.png|thumb|Bill Rauch in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre during one of the informal post-matinee talks]]

Inspired by Shakespeare's canon of plays, Rauch initiated a 10-year program to commission of up to 37 new plays collectively called ''American Revolutions: the United States History Cycle''. Under the direction of Alison Carey, the plays look at moments of change in America's past. Grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the [[Collins Foundation]], the Edgerton Foundation, the Harold and Mimi Steinberg Trust, and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation support American Revolutions. Through December 2016, 32 plays have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, beginning with ''American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jose'' (2010). It was followed by ''Ghost Light'' (2011); ''The March'' (2011 at [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]]); ''Party People'' and ''[[All the Way (play)|All the Way]]'' (2012); ''The Liquid Plain'' (2013); the sequel to ''All the Way'', ''The Great Society'' (2014, commissioned by and co-produced with [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]]), ''[[Sweat (play)|Sweat]]'' (2015), ''Indecent'' (2015 at [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] and [[La Jolla Playhouse]]; 2016 at [[Vineyard Theatre]]; 2017 on Broadway), and ''Roe'' (co-produced with [[Arena Stage]] and [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]).

Through December 2014, ''All the Way'' has received seven awards including co-winner of the inaugural 2013 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History; the 2014 [[Tony Award for Best Play]], the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play]], the [[Drama League Award|Drama League Award for Outstanding Production of a Broadway Play]], the [[Outer Critics Circle Award|Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Play]], the [[Elliot Norton Awards|Elliott Norton Award for Outstanding Production by a Large Resident Theatre]], and the [[IRNE Awards|IRNE Award for Best New Play]], Large Theater. In addition, the 2014 [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play|Tony Award for best actor]] went to Bryan Cranston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=12 Stars Who Won Tony Awards for their Broadway Debut Performances | url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/news/articles/2015-04-13/201504131428983400506.html?promo=rss|website=Tonyawards.com | date=May 20, 2015 | accessdate=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his portrayal of Lyndon Johnson in the Broadway production of ''All the Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title=OSF Sets New AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS Commissions | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/portland/article/OSF-Sets-New-AMERICAN-REVOLUTIONS-Commissions-20150430# | date= April 30, 2015 | accessdate= 2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with [[Arena Stage]], [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]], Center Stage, Company One, [[Guthrie Theater]], [[Penumbra Theatre Company]] Playwrights Center, [[The Public Theater]], [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]] and [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] ensure that the plays will reach beyond their original OSF audience.

In February 2018, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced that Rauch would be leaving after completing the 2019 season to become artistic director of the new Perelman Center at the World Trade Center in New York.

==Play On!==
Columbia University Professor [[John McWhorter]] has pointed out that Shakespeare's language is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre in a matter of seconds while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.&lt;ref name="playon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/upcoming/play-on.aspx | title=Play On! | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play on! is an OSF project being carried out by 36 playwrights paired with dramaturgs working in concert with 17 different theatres and academic institutions commissioned to translate all 39 plays attributed to Shakespeare into contemporary modern English by 31 December 2018. Each playwright is asked to respect the language, meter, rhythm, metaphor, image, rhyme, rhetoric, and emotional content of the original. The goal is 39 unique side-by-side companion translations that are both performable and useful reference texts for classrooms and productions.&lt;ref name="playon" /&gt;

While each playwright will take his or her own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who undertook and completed this task for ''Timon of Athens'' felt that the trick was to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story in a way that is clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.&lt;ref name="playon" /&gt;

==Economic importance==
In 2013, 108,388 individuals bought 407,787 tickets, seeing an average of 3.76 plays each. Of these, 92,234 people were visitors to the area spending $54,534,565 beyond the price of their theater tickets.  Added to the $32,233,543 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2013 was $86,768,108.  In 2015, 103,946 individuals bought 390,380 tickets, seeing an average of 3.3 plays each. Of these, 88,784 people were visitors to the area spending $55,332,927 beyond the price of their theater tickets. Added to the $35,182,783 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2015 was $90,515,710. The estimated total contribution based on the multiplier effect brought total impact to $251,627,515 in 2013 and to $262,495,558 in 2014. The multiplier effect measures how often each dollar received is spent partly on further local goods and services. For OSF, 2.9 is the estimated multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Press Releases and Information | url=http://www.osfashland.org/en/press-room/press-releases.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2014 | accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cwi | first=D.| title=Economic Impacts of Arts and Cultural Institutions | publisher=National Endowment for the Arts | year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance in 2014 at 794 performances of eleven plays was 398,289, 88% of capacity. Attendance in 2015 at 786 performances of eleven plays was 390,387, 87% of capacity.  In 2017, overall attendance at 795 performances was 381,378, 82% of capacity, generating $21.9 million in ticket sales. The difference was accounted for by the eight fewer scheduled performances, variations in seating configurations, cancellation of five outdoor performances in 2015 and of nine outdoor performances in 2017 due to smoke from forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Varble, B. | title=OSF draws more than 390,000 Patrons in 2015 season | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20151105/NEWS/151109915/ |publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2015 | accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Darling, J. | title=That's A Wrap | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20171108/thats-wrap | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Festival hosted the fifth biennial national Asian American Theater Conference and Festival. In addition to a full slate of conference sessions during the week, the event included six original plays, five play readings, and three Green Shows (see above). Participants also had an opportunity to see several regular Festival performances, two of which had an Asian setting and one an Asian-American theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Roberts | first=Dmae | title=Asian Americans take center stage at national theater festival, conference in Ashland | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/art/index.ssf/2016/09/asian_american_theater.html | publisher=The Oregonian | year=2016 | accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSF campus==
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival occupies a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus adjacent to [[Lithia Park]] and the Plaza in Ashland, Oregon. The primary buildings are the three theatres, Carpenter Hall, and the Camps, Pioneer, and Administration buildings, all surrounding an open central court, locally known as "The Bricks" that ties everything together into an architecturally coherent whole and facilitates movement. It also provides a stage for the nightly Green Shows (see above) from June through September.  Other facilities include the Black Swan, which serves as a laboratory for the development of new plays, the production facility, the costume shop, classrooms, and the Hay Patton Rehearsal Center. Other buildings are off campus.

===Allen Elizabethan Theatre===
The Allen Elizabethan Theatre has evolved since the founding of the Shakespeare Festival when the first performance of ''Twelfth Night'' was presented on July 2, 1935.

====Original Elizabethan Theatre====
The design for the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by [[Angus L. Bowmer]] based on his recollection of productions at the University of Washington in which he had acted as a student. [[Ashland, Oregon]] obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it within the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} high circular walls that remained in the roofless shell of the abandoned [[Chautauqua]] theatre. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality! Fifty cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one-dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.&lt;ref name="Bowmer"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowmer | first=Angus | title=Shreds and Patches: The Ashland Elizabethan Stage | location=Ashland, Oregon | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Association | year=1978 | oclc=6040869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Elizabethan Theatre====
The second outdoor Elizabethan Theatre was built in 1947 from plans drawn up by [[University of Washington]] drama professor John Conway. The main stage became trapezoidal, with entries added on either side, and windows added above them flanking the balcony stage.  A low railing gave a finished appearance to the forestage. Chairs arranged to improve sight lines replaced bench seating. Backstage areas were added gradually and haphazardly, until the ramshackle result was ordered torn down as a fire hazard in 1958.&lt;ref name="Bowmer"/&gt;

====Current Allen Elizabethan Theatre====
[[File:Elizabethan Theatre 2014.jpg|thumb|The outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]]The next year saw the opening of the current outdoor theatre, whose name was changed from Elizabethan to Allen Elizabethan Theatre in October, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation Awards OSF $3,000,000 Grant | url=http://osfashland.org/press-room/press-releases/allen-grant.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patterned on London's 1599 [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] and designed by  [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]], it incorporated all the stage dimensions mentioned in the Fortune contract. The trapezoidal stage was retained but the façade was extended to three stories, resulting in a forestage, middle stage, inner below, inner above (the old balcony), and a musicians' gallery. The wings were provided with second-story windows.  Each provides acting areas, creating many staging possibilities. A pitched, shingled roof enhances the half-timbered façade. A windowed gable was extended from the center of the roof to cover and define the middle stage. Just before each performance, an actor opens the gable window, and in keeping with Elizabethan tradition signaling a play in progress, runs a flag up the pole to the sound of a trumpet and doffs his cap to the audience.

The result is an approximate replica of the Fortune Theatre. The known but incomplete dimensions apply only to the stage. The original specifications sometimes say no more than "to be built like the Globe," for which there are no plans or details. The remotely operated lighting, on scaffolding on either side of the stage, of course did not exist in the original and the current site rather than the original architecture determines the shape of the auditorium. Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat. The old Chautauqua theatre walls, now ivy-covered, remain as the outer perimeter of the theatre.

The $7.6 million [[Paul Allen]] Pavilion was added in 1992. It houses a control room, and audience services including infrared hearing devices, blankets, pillows and food and drink, which are allowed in the auditorium.  Several hundred seats were moved to a balcony and two boxes, further improving sightlines and acoustics. Vomitoria (colloquially "voms"), the traditional name for entryways for actors from under the seating area, were added and the lighting scaffolds were eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association.  ''Shakespeare 1970.''  Ashland, Oregon: Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, three plays are offered in rotation Tuesdays through Sundays in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre from late June to early October.

===Angus Bowmer Theatre===
[[File:Bowmer theatre ashland.jpg|thumb|right|Angus Bowmer Theatre in 2013]]An April 1968 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research of the [[University of Oregon]] pointed to the lost opportunity represented by turning away thousands of people by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival each year. It further noted that the Festival had become an important economic engine for southern Oregon, and recommended addition of an indoor theatre. This led the [[Ashland, Oregon|City of Ashland]] to apply to the [[Economic Development Administration]] of the [[Department of Commerce]] in Fall 1968 for a $1,792,000 project grant with the Angus Bowmer Theatre as the keystone. The plan also called for a parking building, a remodeled administration building and box office, a scene shop and exhibit hall that later would become the OSF Black Swan, landscaping, and street realignment. $896,000 was approved in April 1969, to match an equal amount to be raised through private donations. The fund drive quickly exceeded its goal and ground for the new theatre was broken on December 18, 1969.

The theatre was ready just five months later and opened with a production of ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]],'' selected to recognize the Shakespearean origin of the Festival but to signal that the Festical also was ready to broaden its horizons by incorporating modern plays into its repertoire. Reinforcing that signal, ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and ''You Can't Take it with You'' were also presented during that first six-week season.

The Angus Bowmer Theatre seats between 592 and 610 patrons depending on configuration.  Although about half the size of the outdoor theatre, it more than doubled audience capacity by making it possible to hold matinee performances and to extend the season into spring and fall.

The design by [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]] with architects Kirk, Wallace and McKinley of Seattle and contractor Robert D. Morrow, Inc., Salem, Oregon was at once basic, flexible, functional and innovative. All seats are within {{convert|55|ft|m}} of the stage, arranged with only two side aisles and wide spaces between rows. Dark colors resist reflection and draw the eye to the stage. The forestage is on a hydraulic lift system that can emulate the thrust stage of the OSF Allen Elizabethan Theatre, form a more conventional proscenium front, move below auditorium floor level to form an orchestra pit, or drop two stories for storage of equipment or scenery. The walls of the auditorium can swing in to close down the playing area or open to accommodate larger productions.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association. ''Stage II''. Ashland, Oregon: Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OSF Bowmer Theater Set for Fences.jpg|thumb|left|Angus Bowmer Theatre set design by Scott Bradley for August Wilson's ''Fences''. Photo by Jenny Graham.]][[File:OSF Bowmer Theatre Set for Claycart.jpg|thumb|right|Angus Bowmer Theatre set design by Christopher Acebo for ''The Clay Cart''. Photo by Jenny Graham.]]

Illustrating these characteristics, the first picture is the set for August Wilson's ''Fences''. The second, taken two hours later, is the set for the ancient Hindu classic ''The Clay Cart''. Stage crews for the two indoor theatres must complete set changes of this scope six days a week between the end of a matinee and the "call" before the evening curtain (the outdoor stage changes daily). This illustrates the nature of true repertory theater, which allows the playgoer to see different plays on the same day on the same stage, but requires designing and making sets to withstand constant rapid assembly, disassembly and return to accessible storage to await the next change of set.

In what then Executive Director Paul Nicholson called the biggest crisis in the history of the Festival, a crack was discovered in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling support beam of the Bowmer Theatre two hours before the 18 June 2011 matinee. Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, "Bowmer in the Park", was erected as a temporary replacement venue. A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were given in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs. The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving about $200,000, primarily representing the cost of the temporary tent theater itself, unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Galvin | first = R |title = Bowmer Re-opening for August 2 | url = http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110717/NEWS/107170343/-1/rss01 | work = Medford Mail Tribune | date = July 17, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hathaway | first = Brad |title = Temporary Nomads with Tent No More | url = http://livedesignonline.com/news/0802_oreegon_shakespeare | date = August 2, 2011 | accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hayden | first=D | title=Bowmer in the Park: Anatomy of a Crisis | location=Ashland, Oregon | publisher=Sneak Preview 22, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hugely | first = Marty | title = Oregon Shakespeare Festival Re-opens Bowmer Theatre, and Tallies the Losses | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2011/08/oregon_shakespeare_festival_re_4.html|website=Oregonlive.com | date = August 2, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Wheeler | first = Sam |title = 'Bowmer in the Park' Begins  | url = http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110708/NEWS02/107080304 | work = Ashland Daily Tidings | date = July 8, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Wheeler | first = Sam |title = OSF collects $2.6 million in insurance from Bowmer closure  | url = http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120310/NEWS02/203100306/-1/NEWS| work = Ashland Daily Tidings | date = March 10, 2012| accessdate = May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Swan===
The Black Swan (G on the OSF campus map above) served as the Festival's third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, originally an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]], was bought in 1969 as a [[scene shop]] and rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage "midnight" readings for one another. They invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized the opportunity to take risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a "certain amount of tucking and squeezing." Each director had to solve the problem of an immovable roof support in the middle of the stage. For instance, in one production, it became a [[crucifixion]] after a horizontal piece added, .  The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theater, now renamed the Thomas Theatre.  Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).

===Thomas Theatre===
[[File:Thomas Theater at OSF.jpg|thumb|right|The arena seating and set for Macbeth, directed by Libby Appel, which was the opening performance in the Thomas Theatre.]]The limitations stemming from adapting an existing building as the Black Swan led to the design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt; Opened in March 2002 and originally named the '''New Theatre''', it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 as a result of a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name is in recognition of long-time OSF development director Peter Thomas who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]] designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of {{convert|663|ft2|m2}} is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a {{convert|710|ft2|m2|adj=on}} stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a {{convert|1236|ft2|m2|adj=on}} stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a [[trap room]] under the stage and a [[fly loft]] at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry room, [[green room]], quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, [[stage manager]]'s office, maintenance space, and storage for props and set pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Conrad | first=Chris | title='New' No More |url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120317/NEWS02/203170304 |website=Dailytidings.com|  date=17 March 2012 | accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other buildings===
The Box Office (J on the OSF campus map above) is on the same courtyard as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (C) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the Group Sales Office (D), artistic, business, communication, education, human resources, development, community productions, mailroom, and an annex to the costume shop. The Festival Welcome Center (E), on the northern side of the building facing Main Street, offers information about OSF and Ashland, houses a small rotating exhibit of costumes from past shows, and adjoins the [[Margery Bailey]] Room, otherwise known as the Education Center. The adjacent Camps Building (A) houses the members' lounge, marketing offices, and a meeting room.

Just off the courtyard, the Pioneer Building houses the Festival's costume shop. The staff of over 60 creates the costumes and accessories in three main studios on the lower floor of the building and in an extension of the Administration Building.&lt;ref name=Festival/&gt; Also in this area are offices and fitting rooms for the costume designers and costume design assistants, a costume props area and a vented paint room. Upstairs is a dye room, lounge, laundry, storage room, and office. During the height of costume production each season, a wig shop and additional studio is open in the basement of the Angus Bowmer Theatre.

The Festival acquired Carpenter Hall (I) in October 1973, renovating it to accommodate lectures, concerts, rehearsals, meetings and Festival and community events. The Bill Patton Garden (K) provides the venue for free informal summer noon talks by OSF actors and staff. The Tudor Guild, a separate non-profit corporation, operates the Tudor Guild Gift Shop (B) and Brass Rubbing Center (K) where visitors can make rubbings of facsimiles of 55 historic English brasses under expert guidance. Just off campus, a purpose-equipped fitness center is staffed by two professional trainers who help prepare actors for physically demanding roles that often require acrobatics, fights, and pratfalls and monitored during additional open hours by a volunteer.[[File:OSF Production Facility in Talent.jpg|thumb|right|One aisle of the costume warehouse inside the new production facility of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]]

The Festival completed a $7.2 million purpose-built {{convert|71,544|ft2|m2|adj=on}} production facility in neighboring Talent, Oregon, in November 2013 that is home to a multi-function staff of 40. The building houses custom-designed technologically advanced set and prop construction and scene painting facilities. The scene shop has an extensive pit area that precisely duplicates the trap doors in the theaters themselves, allowing for precise sizing, testing of assembly and disassembly, and automating elevator cues. Lighting in the painting areas duplicates that in the theaters, guaranteeing desired colors. The building also houses OSF's costume rental business, which has over 50,000 costumes and over 15,000 costume props such as armor, crowns, and wigs available for rent by other theaters, television and movie producers, and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kent | first=Roberta | title=OSF's Production Facility in Talent Is Complete | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140312/NEWS02/403120303|work=Ashland Daily Tidings|date=March 17, 2014 | accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the removal of the scene construction shop in 2014 from its location in a building a block from the  Festival campus to the new Production Building (see above), a thirteen-month transformation began of the building into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some {{convert|3,000|ft2|m2|adj=on}}, sufficient precisely duplicate any of the three Festival theatres, and one which matches the Thomas Theatre stage. All six include fully sprung floors to protect actors' joints when dancing, rehearsing stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and dimmable, the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers and even people.  Some have special features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. Other features include a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the [[Feldenkrais Method]], a voice studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two [[green room]]s equipped with refrigerator, storage cases, sink, dishwasher, and tables (custom-made by the prop shop) and chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aldous | first=Vickie | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival dedicates new rehearsal center | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20160229/oregon-shakespeare-festival-dedicates-new-rehearsal-center | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=2016-02-29 | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Expansive New Space | url=https://www.osfashland.org/prologue/prologue-spring-2016/prologue-sp16-hay-patton-rehearsal-center.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
OSF is a non-profit corporation managed under US and Oregon law by a 32-member Board of Directors nominated and elected for eight-year terms. The endowment has a net worth in excess of $30 million that returns about $1.2 million to support the annual operating budget. It is managed by seven trustees who are selected for five-year terms by the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kent | first=Roberta | title=OSF's Production Facility in Talent Is Complete | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140312/NEWS02/403120303|work=Ashland Daily Tidings|date=March 17, 2014 | accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSF is supported in part by corporate and individual donors through direct support of individual plays and annual non-voting memberships. These are offered at nine levels, each with its own privileges beginning with basic memberships for $75 which includes access to the member's lounge and a 10% discount in the Tudor Guild shop. Some 750 who contribute $1250-$2999 a year are designated Producer members, enjoying beyond all the benefits of the previous category, two complimentary tickets to plays, twice weekly coffees during which a cast member is interviewed, and three events each including three discussions on aspects of the year's productions and a dinner (at additional cost) with the actors.  Additional benefits accrue to 175 Producer's Circle members who contribute $3000-$5999 in a year, to upward of 80 Chautauqua Guild and Chautauqua members who contribute $6000-$24,999, while those contributing $25,000 or more annually join the Artistic Director's Circle at one of four levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | title=Member Presale Ordering Guide | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 400 (many of whom also are annual members) who have supported the Festival through planned gifts are members of the Southampton Society, named for the Earl of Southampton who was Shakespeare's great patron. They are invited to one three-day event each season similar to the three for Producer members described above. Finally, some 150 people join the Bowmer Society annually providing partial support of the educational efforts of the Festival, described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | title=Souvenir Program | date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional staff===
The OSF professional staff is organized into administrative, artistic, education, and production sections.

The administrative staff of approximately 125 is supervised by Executive Director Cynthia Rider (2013-) who follows Paul Nicholson (1995-2012) and William Patton (1955-1995). The Director of Finance and Administration supervises the physical plant (custodial services, maintenance, and security), accounting, mail room, and receptionists. The Director of Marketing and Communication supervises the box office, membership services, archives (see below), publications and media, marketing, and audience services, which itself includes house managers, ushers, concessions, and access staff for handicapped patrons (see below). The Director of Development supervises institutional giving and major gifts.  The Director of ITS manages information technology. The Director of Human Resources manages employees, volunteer and events programs (see below), safety, and a professional development program called FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships, and Residencies) that provides students aspiring to a career in theater with direct experience of best practices across all aspects of professional theatre. Fellows work directly with senior management while expanding their personal networks. Three residencies varying from four to eleven months are exclusive to the Dramaturgy and Literary Management Department. Twenty-five to thirty Assistantships annually provide hands-on opportunities in virtually every area of the organization by pairing recipients with an appropriate OSF staff member for an average of three months. Finally, 15-20 unpaid Internships of two to four months annually provide emerging artists and administrators with hands-on experience by pairing them with a Festival staff member in the assistant's area of interest. Internships may fulfill academic requirements determined by recipient's home academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/work-with-us/FAIR-fellowships-internships-and-more.aspx |title=FAIR: Fellowships, Internships &amp; More |website=Osfashland.org |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic Director [[Bill Rauch]] (see above) leads a staff consisting of approximately 450. The Artistic Director selects the plays and directors for each season, and chooses the actors, who number between 90 and 120, and the musicians and dancers who number approximately 25. The Associate Artistic Director, in turn, supervises scenic, lighting, and costume design, Fight Director and the [[dramaturg]]s.

A Voice and Text Director is assigned to every play from pre-production through the opening performance. OSF employs two full-time voice and text directors and one or two guest artists each year to meet the demand for these specialists. They help the actors and directors craft vocal choices that will be theatrically effective and sustainable through the run of the show. This can involve work on posture, breath support, resonant placement, muscularity of articulation and screaming technique. They also work with the actors on the text of the play, often in one-on-one sessions. This can include examination of meter, rhythm, sound patterning such as alliteration and rhyme, imagery, and rhetorical structure and devices such as antithesis and repetition. When required, they coach the actors in accents and dialects based on samples of native speakers and work with each actor to find a sound that is as authentic as possible to the character's background but also intelligible in a contemporary theatrical context and conducive to that individual's acting process.

Once the plays have opened, the resident voice and text staff is on hand to help actors with vocal challenges that may arise, attend periodic performances to give maintenance notes, work with understudies, teach voluntary voice classes to the acting company, provide ongoing professional development support in the form of project or individual session work, and participate in play selection and workshops for upcoming seasons.

The production staff of  approximately 125 is responsible for costumes, lighting, properties, scenery, sound, and stage operations. Costumes are produced by a staff of about 60 (artisans, cutters, designers, dyers, first hands, hair and wig specialists, stitchers, technicians, and wardrobe managers). Scenery is built by a staff of  technicians, carpenters, a welder, an engineer and a buyer and moved by a crew of 24 stagehands; lighting staff number eight, and sound and properties each are managed by staffs of six each. A production stage manager, eight stage managers and three production managers ensure the smooth operation of the three theatres and a deck manager coordinates the Green Show.

Reflecting the profession of Festival founder Angus Bowmer, a professor of English at the then [[Southern Oregon Normal School]] (now [[Southern Oregon University]]), education has played an important role at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival from its inception. Under the direction of Joan Langley, the full-time education staff of nine includes the director, both in-residence and outreach program managers and coordinators, a curriculum specialist, and resident teaching artists. The goal is to inspire a lifelong relationship to theater and the works of Shakespeare by offering educational experiences that support each season's plays to a diverse range of students, teachers, and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osfashland.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Collections/M0020%20Education%20Department%20Records%2019472011.ashx |title=About Us |website=Osfashland.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Festival provides a broad range of educational programs for a wide range of ages and interests. The initial focus was on college students and the Institute for Renaissance Studies was formed to meet their needs. The Festival offered short courses, lectures, readings, concerts, and exhibits focused on the plays of the season. Participation was open to all Festival company members and audiences, either for college credit from several universities, or for audit. Coursework was supported by a collection of Renaissance and late-medieval books, manuscripts, and prints now housed in the Southern Oregon University's Hannon Library.

Programs specifically for teachers include the weekend "Inside Shakespeare" and the five-day retreat, "Shakespeare in the Classroom" that emphasizes innovative and pedagogical methods to help teachers make the works of Shakespeare involving and accessible to contemporary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/education/teacher-trainings.aspx |title=Teacher Trainings |website=Osfashland.org |date=2016-07-02 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre in 1971 and the subsequent expansion of the Festival season into the school year enabled an increasing variety of educational programs for middle and high school students. Students visiting the Festival itself are the recipients of some 55,000 discounted tickets each year. Some 900 workshops offered each year by OSF actor-teachers enhance the educational value of their visits. The Bowmer Project for Student Playgoers (initiated in 1996) prepares local teachers to teach plays and includes tickets to a performance, a back-stage tour, and a post-show discussion with one of the actors. Each year since 1981, OSF has offered residential Summer Seminars for High School Juniors that enroll 65 students in a two-week program during which they see several plays and learn about on-stage technique and theatre management.

For those unable to come to the Festival, six pairs of actors participate in the School Visit Program, initiated in 1971, which now reaches some 60,000 students primarily in four states although it has made occasional visits to eight others. Each one-day visit includes two 50-minute performances and one two-hour or two one-hour workshops. Performances are a condensed version of one Shakespeare play, selected scenes from Shakespeare illustrating a single theme, or a combination of Shakespeare and other literature selected to meet the needs of the school being visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lacaze |first=Katherine |url=http://www.mailtribune.com/article/20151130/NEWS/151139972 |title=OSF goes into classrooms across the state - News - MailTribune.com - Medford, OR |website=MailTribune.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs of different lengths and formality to meet the needs and interests of adults include Wake Up With Shakespeare, Shakespeare Comprehensive, Festival Noons, Prefaces, Prologues, Park Talks, Road Scholars, and "Unfolding Seminars." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/education/public-events-classes.aspx | title=Public Events and Classes | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, OSF's Development Department offers educational opportunities through its tours offered in late Fall, often on cruise ships such as [[Queen Mary 2]]. Past tours have included two to England focused on Shakespeare, one to Greece and Turkey focused on the beginnings and history of theater, and one along the coasts of France and Spain and to the Canary Islands.  These tours feature an intensive schedule of lectures and interactive workshops with four to eight OSF staff and actors, as well as visits to local attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Collections/M0020%20Education%20Department%20Records%2019472011.ashx |title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival : Archives Division : Education Department Records, 1947-2010 |website=Osfashland.org |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access Service Program===
Audience Services offers a full range of programs and services for patrons with disabilities. For blind and visually impaired patrons, the Festival has six professional audio describers on staff who provide live audio description for every performance of every play with two weeks advance notice. Braille and large print playbills are available for all productions. Service animals are always welcome. For deaf and hearing-impaired patrons, six American Sign Language interpreted performances with highly trained interpreters are offered each season. Complimentary infrared listening devices and Telecoil hearing aid loops are available in all three of the Festival's theatres, and patrons may communicate with the Festival through the Oregon Telecommunications Relay Service. There is accessible seating in all performance venues, nearby accessible parking, and all of the above accommodations can be provided for the wide range of ancillary events that enrich the OSF experience, such as backstage tours, prefaces, prologues, and park talks. Each season a limited number of performances, post-show meet-and-greets, pre-show introductions, and backstage tours are open-captioned in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Accessibility  Services| url=http://www.osfashland.org/_dwn/plays/Access_Brochure_2011.pdf | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2011 | accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
The archivists develop, preserve, and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents and oral histories, drawings and photographs, audio and video recordings, and artifacts pertaining to the artistic and administrative history and heritage of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Collecting, organizing, and preserving these materials of what otherwise is an ephemeral art form to archival standards is an ongoing effort aided in part by a two-year grant from the National Historical Publications and Research Commission, with material added on an ongoing basis.

The archives are open Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM, and the staff invites any inquiry or reference question by phone or email. Researchers and the general public are welcome to visit the archives by appointment. Other collections are available for research, although some collections have restrictions, and permission must be obtained for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=Our History | url=http://osfashland.org/about/our-history.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Archives | url=http://osfashland.org/en/about/archives.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival Archives | url=http://www.facebook.com/osfarchives | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archives include Education department records from 1947 on and document the department's programming and structural evolution. Print materials include annual reports, brochures, calendars, correspondence, course handouts, course readings, news clippings, newsletters, photographs, posters, scripts, statistics and survey reports, study guides, and teacher information kits, guides, and resource kits. Audio and video recordings include radio broadcasts and school visit program performances.

In May, 2013, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] awarded the Festival a $200,000 grant to digitize 2649 deteriorating tapes, films and videos  and to make them publicly available through its website and the YouTube platform. The collection spans the history of the Festival from its inception in 1935 through 2012 and comprises an unparalleled and comprehensive record of Shakespearean and theatrical performance by a single U.S. theatre company. Included are full-length recordings of 541 of the 570 Festival productions from 1950 to 2012, including three or more varied interpretations of every play in the Shakespearean canon with exemplary casts before live audiences and the ballad opera series. The production recordings are supplemented by 44 adaptations broadcast on NBC radio, more than 100 hours of artist interviews, Shakespeare lectures by nationally and internationally renowned scholars and educators, production music, promotional recordings, and recordings of significant events in the company's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=$200,000 NEH Grant Supports Digitization | url=http://www.osfashland.org/press-room/press-releases/neh-grant.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included are the home movies of founder Angus Bowmer, Southern Oregon Normal School events and rare footage of the initial 1935 Festival season!

===Volunteers===
The professional staff is augmented by volunteers—approximately 700 contributing about 32,000 hours each year.  Tudor Guild volunteers staff the brass rubbing center, concession stands, and gift shop. Volunteers welcome visitors to the campus and answer their questions, staff the Green Show information table and welcome center, facilitate post-matinee discussions, provide concierge services for student groups, and supplement the professional ushers at all three theatres. Behind the scenes, volunteers help with office tasks such as preparing will-call tickets for pickup, sorting mail, filing, copying, mailings, and transcribing interviews. They work in the Archives, Costume Shop, Costume Warehouse, and Scene Shop, help with auditions, and serve as attendants in the company fitness facility. Among occasional tasks too numerous to provide a complete list, volunteers assist with access services and the periodic audience surveys, drive company vehicles, providing transportation for visiting dignitaries, and direct traffic during "strike" at the end of the season. Each year, company members present a thank you show titled ''Love's Labors'' for the volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Coombs | first=Mary | title=A huge cast of volunteers makes the show go on | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20160302/NEWS/160309973/ | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage Technology===
The availability of small inexpensive [[computing platforms]], [[LED]]s, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects to be built into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. [[WiFi]] and [[Bluetooth]] devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated and colors changed live while on stage. Costumes in ''Head Over Heels'' (a musical by Lolita Snipes), ''[[The Wiz]]'', and ''The Winter's Tale'' are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.

The theatres feature [[Meyer Sound Laboratories|Meyer speakers]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[mixing console]]s, Clear-Com Freespeak wireless communication, [[Sennheiser]] wireless microphone systems and [[Qlab]] software playback for their theater spaces. The Elizabethan Theater underwent a major audio system re-design with Meyer Sound Laboratories in 2014. The install included various types of Mina [[line array]]s (UPQ-1Ps, UPQ-2Ps, MM4-Xps, 500 HPs, UPM-1Xps and UP-4Xps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Stabler | first=David | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival installs new, hopefully improved, sound system in outdoor theater | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2014/04/oregon_shakespeare_festival_in.html | publisher=The Oregonian | date= 2014-04-21 | accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
All playgoers are offered a complimentary [[Programme (booklet)|''Playbill'']] with a synopsis of the plays, cast lists, and directors' statements. All members receive 3 editions of ''Prologue'' each season (one each for spring, summer, and fall). This magazine contains selected articles on directors, actors, costumes, props, and plays each season.  Another publication that is made available at higher donor levels is ''Illuminations'', a comprehensive guide to each year's plays.  ''Illuminations'' includes synopses, themes, information on playwrights and historical and other contextual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/membership/about/supporting.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612233423/http://osfashland.org/membership/about/supporting.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, the Festival publishes Teachers First! providing information on the season's plays including age suitability, the seasonal calendar, ordering and discount information.

The annual ''Souvenir Program.'' includes photographic highlights of each play and special articles along with pictures and biographies of actors, playwrights, and the many people who work behind the scenes. A chart emphasizing the repertory nature of OSF lists all the actors and their parts in the plays.

The Festival also publishes a ''Bard's Scorecard,'' which lists all of William Shakespeare's Plays, the years OSF produced them, and allows repeat patrons to cross off which plays they've seen towards completing the canon.

===Professional memberships===
OSF is a constituent of [[Theatre Communications Group]], the national service organization for the not-for-profit theatre world, and a member of the [[Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]]. It operates under contracts with [[Actors' Equity Association]], The Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States, and the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]], Inc., an independent national labor union.

'''Prehistoric art in Scotland''' is [[visual art]] created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the [[Roman Empire in Britain|Romans]] from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Medieval era]]. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood.

The earliest examples of [[portable art]] from what is now Scotland are highly decorated [[petrosphere|carved stone balls]] from the [[Neolithic]] period, which share patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from [[Links of Noltland]], including the [[Westray Wife]], which is the earliest known depiction of a human face from Scotland.

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]].  Representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s may be symbolic representations of power. Surviving metalwork includes [[gold lunula]] or neckplates, [[jet (lignite)|jet]] beaded necklaces and elaborate weaponry, such as [[Xiphos|leaf sword]]s and ceremonial shields of sheet bronze.

From the [[Iron Age]] there are more extensive examples of patterned objects and gold work. Evidence of the wider [[La Tène]] culture includes the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]]. The [[Stirling torcs]] demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland and continental workmanship. One of the most impressive items from this period is the boar's head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]]. From the first century CE, as Rome carried out a series of occupations, there are Roman artifacts like the [[Cramond Lioness]] and Roman influence on material culture can be seen in local stone carvings.

==Definitions and meanings==
[[File:Ancient cup and ring stone, Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow - DSC06245.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Cup and ring marks]] survive in large numbers from Scotland and have been suggested to have a variety of meanings]]
The ability to study [[prehistoric art]] is dependent on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and to a lesser extent wood), later pottery and metal, are more likely to be extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. [[Alexander Marshack]] argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, [[Paul Mellars]] suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", in G. Berghaus, ed., ''New Perspectives on Prehistoric Art'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), {{ISBN|0-2759-7813-3}}, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Renfrew]] has pointed out the dangers of applying modern values of art to past societies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bradley, ''Image and Audience: Rethinking Prehistoric Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-1915-6955-0}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached with a set of post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", in D. Garrow, ed., ''Rethinking Celtic Art'' (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2008), {{ISBN|1-7829-7821-6}}, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many meanings have been suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air [[rock art]] may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art may have had a ritual role in [[initiation ceremony|rites of initiation]], [[vision quests]] or [[totemic]] ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as [[notation]] systems and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no surviving art from the Mesolithic period in Scotland, probably because the mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items.&lt;ref&gt;G. Warren, ''Mesolithic Lives in Scotland'' (Tempus, 2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the oldest surviving [[portable art|portable visual art]] from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name=Towie&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108 (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at [[Pierowall]] on [[Westray]], Orkney, which seem to be part of the same culture that produced carvings at [[Newgrange]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, elaborately carved [[Mace (bludgeon)|maceheads]] are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11/&gt;

Pottery appeared in the Neolithic period once hunters and gatherers transitioned to a sedentary lifestyle, until then they needed to use lightweight, mobile containers.&lt;ref name=Bahn1997p100&gt;P.

In 2009 the [[Westray Wife]], a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at [[Links of Noltland]] near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray.

The Bronze Age began in Scotland about 2000 BCE as new techniques of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued.&lt;ref&gt;C. Scarre, ''Monuments and Landscape in Atlantic Europe: Perception and Society during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age'' (New York: Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|0-4152-7314-5}}, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; There was probably a fall in population in this period.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere in Europe, [[hill forts]] were first introduced in this period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-5002-8795-3}}, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this period there are extensive examples of rock art. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Similar carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, rather than being practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Forteviot Bronze Age tomb|site at Forteviot]], in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Surviving metalwork includes personal items like the [[gold lunula]] or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and are similar to those found in relatively large numbers in Ireland, but also with examples across Great Britain and in Portugal.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-527-C&amp;scache=3tl8ga9bi2&amp;searchdb=scran "Collar from Southside, Lanarkshire], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]] beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and [[Aberlemno]] in Angus.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13/&gt;

==Iron Age==
{{See also|Iron Age}}
[[File:Museum of ScotlandDSCF6322.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Leichestown Deskford [[carnyx]] and reconstruction, probably dating from the first century CE]]
The Iron Age began in Scotland from about the seventh century BCE. From this point there are the first finds of iron artifacts in hoards that are consistent containing other items that are consistent with Bronze Age practice. there is also evidence of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit and I. B. M. Ralston, "The Iron Age", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early part of the period there is relatively little metalwork and a larger amount of ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture, which is named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman, Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BCE and 100 BCE. Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France, and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are surviving ring-headed pins, which were probably made locally and not imported, and appear to be part of a British and Irish type that was not part of the La Tène culture. There are also spiral finger rings, glass beads and long-handled combs, which are found across Britain, but have local characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze [[Stichill]] collar is a large engraved necklace, fastened at the back with a pin. The [[Mortonhall]] [[scabbard]], probably from the first century CE, is elaborately decorated with trumpet curves and "S"-scrolls. Further north there are finds of massive bronze armlets, often with enamelled decoration, like the ones found at [[Culbin Sands]], Moray.&lt;ref&gt;R. Megaw and J. V. S. Megaw, ''Early Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (Bodley: Osprey, 2nd edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-7478-0613-6}}, pp. 72–4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most impressive items from this period is the boars head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]], a war-trumpet from [[Deskford]] in Banffshire, probably dating from the first century CE. Similar instruments are mentioned in Roman sources and depicted on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]] found in Denmark.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p16&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In stone carving there are a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at [[Coupar Angus]] in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age. They are similar to those found across Great Britain and Ireland, although they are difficult to date and may have been made much later.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit, ''Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-5218-7756-3}}, pp. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman influence==
{{See also|Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman art}}
[[File:Cramond Lioness.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cramond Lioness]] found near the Roman base of [[Cramond Roman Fort]] near Edinburgh, which was occupied in the second century CE]]
The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation was limited to the [[Southern Uplands]] and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Solway Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hanson, "The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as [[Hadrian's Wall]] from coast to coast.&lt;ref name=Antoninewall&gt;[http://www.antoninewall.org/history.php "History"], ''antoninewall.org'', retrieved 25 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new ''[[limes]]'' between the Firth of Forth and the [[Firth of Clyde]], where they built the fortification known as the [[Antonine Wall]]. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall,&lt;ref name=Antoninewall /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Breeze, ''The Antonine Wall'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 2006), {{ISBN|0-85976-655-1}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-500-28795-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;297–301.&lt;/ref&gt; until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hanson, "The Roman presence: brief interludes", in K. J. Edwards and I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antonine Wall and its associated forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Apollo]]. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house in the shape of a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess [[Fortuna]], both found at [[Bearsden]] Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/collections/permanentdisplays/theantoninewall/theantoninewallslideshow/#d.en.219761 The Antonine Wall: Rome's Final Frontier: Slideshow], ''Glasgow University, The Hunterian'', retrieved 19 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from the wall, Roman sculptures include the marble head of a Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at [[Hawkshaw, Scottish Borders|Hawkshaw]], Peebleshire in the late eighteenth century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman monument further to the south.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. F. Keppie, ''Scotland's Roman Remains: an Introduction and Handbook'' (John Donald, 2nd edn., 1998), {{ISBN|0-8597-6157-6}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cramond Lioness]] is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of [[Cramond Roman Fort]] near Edinburgh. A [[relief]] of the goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]] found near Birrens in [[Dumfriesshire]], combines elements of native and classical art.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 16–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Newstead Helmet]], found at the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, is one of the most impressive of many finds of Roman arms and armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Parade helmet and face mask | url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-815-C&amp;scache=6r7o44xpxl&amp;searchdb=scran | publisher=[[National Museums Scotland]] | accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] is a second-century Romano-British ''[[trulla]]'' apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1577008&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=enamelled+pan&amp;fromDate=1&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toDate=300&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 "The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan"], ''British Museum'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of items were also found in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, needles and coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/16278/details/sculptor+s+cave+covesea/ "Site Record for Sculptor's Cave Covesea"], ''Historic Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland'', retrieved 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charlemagne-by-Durer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charlemagne]] holds a sword in his proper right hand, on the "viewer's left", and an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] in his proper left hand.]] 
[[File:Orestes (1848).jpg|thumb|Statue holding a sword in its proper right hand]]
'''Proper right''' and '''proper left''' are conceptual terms used to unambiguously convey [[relative direction]] when describing an image or other object. The "proper right" hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;"For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR (proper right) and PL (proper left) to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue (i.e., your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue)" - p. 34, [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/SOSvolunteerHandboook.pdf Save Outdoor Sculpture! Volunteer Handbook]. ("Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) is a joint project of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property").&lt;/ref&gt; In a frontal representation, that appears on the left as the viewer sees it, creating the potential for ambiguity if the hand is just described as the "right hand".

The terms are mainly used in discussing images of humans, whether in [[art history]], medical contexts such as [[x-ray]] images, or elsewhere, but they can be used in describing any object that has an unambiguous front and back (for example [[furniture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gNN1vgkxzicC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false ''The Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820: 'A True North Britain' in the Southern Backcountry'']&lt;/ref&gt;) or,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM00539/ though see this somewhat puzzling example], which appears just to refer to the specific image, with the side shown the "front".&lt;/ref&gt; when describing things that move or change position, with reference to the original position. However a more restricted use may be preferred, and the internal instructions for cataloguing objects in the "Inventory of American Sculpture" at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] say that "The terms "proper right" and "proper left" should be used when describing figures only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/inventory/report_form_guidelines.pdf Smithsonian American Art Museum], "Inventorying" section.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heraldry]], right and left is always used in the meaning of proper right and proper left, as for the imaginary bearer of a coat of arms; to avoid confusion, the Latin terms [[dexter and sinister]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bedingfeld|first1= Henry|author1-link= Henry Bedingfeld|last2= Gwynn-Jones|first2= Peter|author2-link= Peter Gwynn-Jones|page= 42|title= Heraldry|year= 1993|location= Leicester|publisher= Magna Books|isbn= 1-85422-433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative is to use language that makes it clear that the viewer's perspective is being used. The swords in the illustrations might be described as: "to the left as the viewer sees it", "at the view's left", "at the viewer's left", and so on.  However these formulations do not work for freestanding sculpture in the round, where the viewer might be at any position around the sculpture.  A British 19th-century manual for military drill contrasts "proper left" with "present left" when discussing the orientation of formations performing intricate movements on a parade ground, "proper" meaning the orientraion at the start of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;''Brigade drill, as established by order in the Field exercise and evolutions of infantry, as revised in 1859. With remarks and references, by W.N. Hutchinson'', 1860, War Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UU4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are analogous to the nautical [[port and starboard]], where "port" is to a watercraft as "proper left" is to a sculpture, and they are used for essentially the same reason. Their use obviates the need for potentially ambiguous language such as "my right," "your left," and so on, by expressing the direction in a manner that holds true regardless of the relative orientations of the object and observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 The origins of 'port' and 'starboard'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025011852/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 |date=2007-10-25 }} at the UK [[National Maritime Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is [[stage right]] and left in the theatre, which uses the actor's orientation, "stage right" equating to the audience's "house left".

There are a variety of '''religious views on [[suicide]]'''.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on suicide}}
Suicides are frowned upon and buried in a separate part of a Jewish cemetery, and may not receive certain mourning rites. In actual practice, every means is used to excuse suicide—usually by determining either that the suicide itself proves that the person was not in their right mind, or that the person committing suicide must have repented after performing the deadly act but shortly before death occurred. Taking one's own life may be seen as a preferred alternative to committing certain [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish law|cardinal sins]].&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Bavli Gittin, 57b.&lt;/ref&gt; Most authorities hold that it is not permissible to hasten death to avoid pain if one is dying in any event, but the [[Talmud]] is somewhat unclear on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Bavli Avoda Zara 18a&lt;/ref&gt; However, assisting in suicide and requesting such assistance (thereby creating an accomplice to a sinful act) is forbidden, a violation of [[Leviticus]] 19:14 ("Do not put a [[stumbling block]] before the blind"), which is understood as prohibiting tempting to sin as well as literally setting up physical obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Bavli (B.) Pesachim 22b; B. Mo'ed Katan 5a, 17a; B. Bava Mezia 75b. and B. Nedarim 42b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass suicide has had a long-standing history in Judaism where it was also acceptable to other alternatives. According to the 1st-century CE [[Jew]]ish historian [[Josephus]], [[Herod the Great]] fortified [[Masada]] between 37 and 31 [[BCE]] as a refuge for himself in the event of a revolt. In 66 CE, at the beginning of the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], a group of Jewish extremists called the [[Sicarii]] overcame the Roman [[garrison]] of Masada. After the [[Destruction of the Temple|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, additional members of the [[Sicarii]] and numerous Jewish families fled [[Jerusalem]] and settled in the mountaintop fortress, using it as a base for harassing the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/Masada1.html Jewish Virtual Library - Masada]&lt;/ref&gt; This 960-strong Jewish community at [[Masada]] collectively committed suicide in 73 CE rather than be conquered and enslaved by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Each man killed his wife and children, then the men [[sortition|drew lots]] and killed each other until the last man killed himself. In this way, only the last man committed the sin of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netours.com/jrs/2003/masada-revolt.htm Masada and the first Jewish revolt against Rome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016113344/http://www.netours.com/jrs/2003/masada-revolt.htm |date=2009-10-16 }}: Near East Tourist Industry, Steven Langfur 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{main|Christian views on suicide}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
Nothing in the Christian Bible expressly prohibits suicide. In fact, the Bible does not condemn it and there are people in the bible who committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/july10/30.61.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Gorsuch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil M. Gorsuch|title=The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lnXyNwYEPwC|date=12 April 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-14097-9|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Christian dogmas take an unfavorable view of suicide. Christianity also does not say that suicide is an unforgivable sin, although some other religions might. &lt;ref&gt;https://lifehopeandtruth.com/life/life-after-death/what-does-the-bible-say-about-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theology of [[the Roman Catholic Church]], suicide is objectively a sin which violates the commandment "Thou shalt not kill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 2280, 2281|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the gravity and culpability for that sin changes based on the circumstances surrounding that sin.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 2283 states: "We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives." Paragraph 2282 also points out that "Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide." The Catholic Church used to deny suicides a Catholic funeral mass and burial. However, the Church has since changed this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byron|first=William|title=Do People Who Commit Suicide Go to Hell?|url=http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/knowledge/2007/04-01/do-people-who-commit-suicide-go-to-hell|publisher=Catholic Digest|accessdate=10 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219215546/http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/knowledge/2007/04-01/do-people-who-commit-suicide-go-to-hell|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Protestants ([[Evangelicals]], [[Charismatics]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], and other denominations) have often argued that suicide is self-[[murder]], and so anyone who commits it is sinning and it is the same as if the person murdered another human being. An additional view concerns the act of asking for salvation and accepting Jesus Christ as personal savior, which must be done prior to death. This is an important aspect of many Protestant denominations, and the problem with suicide is that once dead the individual is unable to accept salvation. The unpardonable sin then becomes not the suicide itself, but rather the refusal of the gift of salvation.

Suicide is regarded generally within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Tradition]] as a rejection of God's gift of physical life, a failure of stewardship, an act of despair, and a transgression of the sixth commandment, "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13). 
The Orthodox Church normally denies a [[Christian burial]] to a person who has committed suicide. However, factors bearing on the particular case may become known to the priest who must share this information with the diocesan bishop; the bishop will consider the factors and make the decision concerning funeral services. The condemnation of suicide is reflected in the teachings of [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and others. The Orthodox Church shows compassion, however, on those who have taken their own life because of [[mental illness]] or severe emotional stress, when a physician can verify a condition of impaired rationality.

Some other denominations of Christianity may not condemn those who commit suicide per se as committing a sin, even if suicide is not viewed favorably; factors such as motive, character, etc. are believed to be taken into account.  One such example is [[The New Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Odhner|first=John|title=Reflections on Suicide|url=http://whatthebiblesays.info/suicide.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232842/http://whatthebiblesays.info/suicide.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), suicide is generally viewed as wrong, although the victim may not be considered responsible for the act depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide|url=http://lds.org/study/topics/suicide?lang=eng|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Christian traditions, attitudes to suicide were somewhat varied. Among the martyrs at [[Antioch]] were three women who committed suicide to avoid rape. Although William Phipps gives this as an example of virtuous early Christian suicides, Augustine declared that although they may have done "what was right in the sight of God," in his view the women "should not have assumed that rape would necessarily have deprived them of their purity." (As purity was, to Augustine, a state of mind.)&lt;ref name="Christian Perspectives on Suicide"&gt;{{cite web|first=William|last=Phipps|publisher=religion-online|accessdate=27 November 2013|title=Christian Perspectives on Suicide|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{Bibleverse|Psalm|139:8|KJV}} ("If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.") has often been discussed in the context of the [[Afterlife#Christianity|fate]] of those who commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Dowie 1902 p. 702"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowie |first=J.

===Islam===
All Muslim scholars and clerics consider suicide [[haram|forbidden]] and similarly include [[suicide bombing]] as being equally forbidden.&lt;ref name="hijacked_caravan"&gt;

A verse in the Quran instructs: {{quote|"And do not kill yourselves, surely God is most Merciful to you."| Qur'an, Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), [[ayat]] 29 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|29|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prohibition of suicide has also been recorded in statements of [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]); for example:
{{quote|Narrated [[Abu Huraira]]: The Prophet said, "He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire."|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|2|23|446}}}}

Nevertheless, the militant groups (and those that support them) that carry out "martyrdom operations" believe that their actions fulfil the obligation of [[jihad]], (however, in the Quran there is no mention of suicide being an act of jihad) and some clerics support this view under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="wp_london_tough"&gt;[[Mona Eltahawy]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072201629.html "After London, Tough Questions for Muslims"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 22 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Similarly, a minority of Muslims in Muslim-majority countries also express support for suicidal martyrdom to varying degrees.&lt;ref name=pew2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Arab Spring Fails to Improve U.S. Image: Obama’s Challenge in the Muslim World|date=17 May 2011|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|chapter=Chapter&amp;nbsp;4.

==Indian religions==
===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]], an individual's past acts are recognized to heavily influence what they experience in the present; present acts, in turn, become the background influence for future experiences (the [[doctrine]] of [[karma]]). Intentional actions by ''mind, body or speech'' have a reaction. This reaction, or repercussion, is the cause of conditions and differences one encounters in life.

Buddhism teaches that all people experience substantial [[suffering]] (''[[dukkha]]''), in which suffering primarily originates from past negative deeds (karma), or may result as a natural process of the cycle of birth and death (''[[samsara]]''). Other reasons for the prevalence of suffering concern the concepts of [[impermanence]] and [[illusion]] (''[[maya (Buddhism)|maya]]''). Since everything is in a constant state of impermanence or flux, individuals experience dissatisfaction with the fleeting events of life. To break out of ''samsara'', Buddhism advocates the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and does not advocate suicide.

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], for a monk to so much as praise death, including dwelling upon life's miseries or extolling stories of possibly blissful rebirth in a higher realm in a way that might condition the hearer to commit suicide or to pine away to death, is explicitly stated as a breach in one of highest [[vinaya]] codes, the prohibition against harming life, one that will result in automatic expulsion from [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt &amp; Norman, ''The Patimokkha'', 2001, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, Defeat 3&lt;/ref&gt;

For Buddhists, since the first precept is to refrain from the destruction of life, including one's self, suicide is seen as a negative act. If someone commits suicide in anger, he may be reborn in a sorrowful realm due to negative final thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hi.baidu.com/762841999/blog/item/89f19ff301e39cce0b46e054.html 千萬不要自殺﹗--悔恨千年剧烈痛苦!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfnn.org/cherish/ 珍惜生命（墮胎與自殺的真相）]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Buddhism does not condemn suicide without exception, but rather observes that the reasons for suicide are often negative and thus counteract the path to enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-NX020/09_09.htm 論佛教的自殺觀]&lt;/ref&gt;  With that said, in thousands of years of Buddhist history, very few exceptions are found.

One exception is the Buddhist tale of a ''[[bhikkhu]]'' named Vakkali who was extremely ill and racked with excruciating pain.  He was said to have committed suicide when near death and upon making statements suggesting he had passed beyond desires (and thus perhaps an ''[[arhant]]'').&lt;ref name="suffering"/&gt;  Self-[[euthanasia]] appears the context for his death.

Another exception is the story of a bhikkhu named Godhika, also beset by illness,&lt;ref name="suffering"&gt;[http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html Suicide as a Response to Suffering]&lt;/ref&gt; who had repeatedly attained temporary liberation of mind but was unable to gain final liberation due to illness.&lt;ref name="suffering"/&gt; While believing himself again in a state of temporary liberation it occurred to him to cut his own throat, in hopes thus to be reborn in a high realm.&lt;ref name="suffering"/&gt; The [[Buddha]] was said to have stated:

{{quote|Such indeed is how the steadfast act:
They are not attached to life.
Having drawn out craving at its root
Godhika has attained final [[Nirvana|Nibbaana]].&lt;ref name="suffering"/&gt;}}

Ultimately, tales like these could be read as implying past Buddhist beliefs that suicide might be acceptable in certain circumstances if it might lead to non-attachment. However, people who have achieved enlightenment do not commit suicide. In both above cases, the monks were not enlightened before committing suicide but they hoped to become enlightened following their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml Buddhism, euthanasia and suicide] at the [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Channovàda-sutra gives a third exceptional example of one who committed suicide and subsequently attained enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.buddhistethics.org/3/keown.pdf |title=Buddhism and Suicide The Case of Channa |author=Damien Keown |journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics |volume=3 |issue=1996 |pages=19–21 |accessdate=2010-11-29 |quote= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615221136/http://buddhistethics.org/3/keown.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an entry in ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', Marilyn J. Harran wrote the following:
{{quote|Buddhism in its various forms affirms that, while suicide as self-sacrifice may be appropriate for the person who is an arhat, one who has attained enlightenment, it is still very much the exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mircea Eliade |coauthors= |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion (vol 14) |year= |publisher=New York: Macmillan |quote= |pages=129 | url= |isbn=0-02-865733-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another exceptional example is the act of [[Sokushinbutsu]] in [[Japanese Buddhism]], which involves [[asceticism]] to the point of death and entering [[mummification]] while alive&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah, Ken. Living Buddhas: The Self-mummified Monks of Yamagata, Japan. McFarland, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. This is done to attain [[Buddha-nature]] in one's body.

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], suicide is spiritually unacceptable. Generally, committing suicide is considered a violation of the code of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and therefore equally [[sin]]ful as murdering another. Some scriptures state that to die by suicide (and any type of violent death) results in becoming a [[ghost]], wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Website. [http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_suicide.asp Hinduism and suicide]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' talks of suicide, stating those who commit it can never attain to regions (of heaven) that are blessed.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata section CLXXXI&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism accepts a man's [[right to die|right to end one's life]] through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed ''[[Prayopavesa]]''.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml|title= Hinduism - Euthanasia and Suicide|date= 2009-08-25|publisher= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to old age yogis who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt; Another example is dying in a battle to save one's honor.

''[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]'' or ''suttee''{{Refn|group=note|The spelling ''suttee'' is a phonetic spelling using the 19th-century English orthography. The ''sati'' transliteration uses the more modern [[IAST]] (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) which is the academic standard for writing the Sanskrit language with the Latin alphabet system.&lt;ref name="asnic.utexas.edu"/&gt;}} is an obsolete funeral custom where a [[widow]] immolates herself on her husband's [[pyre]] or [[suicide|takes her own life]] in another fashion shortly after her husband's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DHE3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT83&amp;redir_esc Feminist Spaces: Gender and Geography in a Global Context], Routledge, Ann M. Oberhauser, Jennifer L. Fluri, Risa Whitson, Sharlene Mollett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Gilmartin (1997), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25058378 ''The Sati, the Bride, and the Widow: Sacrificial Woman in the Nineteenth Century]''], Victorian Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 25, No. 1, page 141, Quote: "Suttee, or sati, is the obsolete Hindu practice in which a widow burns herself upon her husband's funeral pyre..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arvind Sharma]] (2001), Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804647}}, pages 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=julialeslie /&gt;Some people in India have recently done the same, although it is officially banned.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/world/india-seizes-four-after-immolation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], suicide is regarded as the worst form of ''himsā'' (violence) and is not permitted. ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsā]]'' (nonviolence) is the fundamental doctrine of Jainism. There exists a Jain practice of fasting to death which is termed as ''[[Sallekhana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathreference.com/Ho-Ka/Jainism.html Suicide and Jainism]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jain text]] ''Purushartha Siddhyupaya'', when death is near, the vow of sallekhanā is observed by properly thinning the body and the passions. It also mentions that sallekhanā is not suicide since the person observing it is devoid of all passions like attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jain|first1=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Amritchandra's Purushartha Siddhyupaya|year=2012|p=115|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=81-903639-4-8|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8190363948|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/AcharyaAmritchandrasPurusharthaSiddhyupaya|archivedate=2012|quote=Non-Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopagan religions==
===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]] as well as numerous other [[Neopagan]] religions, there is no general consensus concerning suicide.  Some view suicide as a violation of the sanctity of life, and a violation of the most fundamental of Wiccan laws, the [[Wiccan Rede]].  However, as Wicca teaches a belief in [[reincarnation]] instead of permanent rewards or punishments, many believe that suicides are reborn (like every one else) to endure the same circumstances in each subsequent lifetime until the capacity to cope with the circumstance develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/contemporaryissues/qt/Suicide.htm |title=Pagans and Suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Charles Davidson''', [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] (born 4 November 1946 in [[Hydaburg, Alaska]]), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] artist of [[Haida people|Haida]] heritage. Davidson’s Haida name is ''Guud San Glans'', which means "Eagle of The Dawn". He is a leading figure in the renaissance of [[Haida art]] and culture.

==Life and work==

[[File:White Rock, BC - Haida totem pole 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of "Gyaana", totem pole designed by Davidson and carved by him and others, Lions Lookout Park, [[White Rock, British Columbia]], Canada.]]

Davidson is known internationally as a carver of totem poles and masks, printmaker, painter and jeweller.  He lives near Vancouver, working out of a studio on [[Semiahmoo First Nation]] land and making annual return visits to [[Haida Gwaii]].

His parents are [[Claude Davidson (Haida artist)|Claude]] and Vivian Davidson. Through Claude, he is the grandson of the Haida artist and memoirist [[Florence Davidson]].  He is a member of the Eagle [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]], Ts'ał'lanas lineage.  His younger brother and former apprentice, [[Reg Davidson]], is also a Haida carver.

In infancy, Robert Davidson moved with his family to the Haida village of [[Masset, British Columbia]], on [[Queen Charlotte Islands|Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)]]. For high school, he moved to [[Vancouver]] to attend [[Point Grey Secondary School]] in 1965. In 1966 he became apprenticed to the master Haida carver [[Bill Reid]].  In 1967 he began studies at the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design|Vancouver School of Art]].  In 1969 he carved and raised the first totem pole on Haida Gwaii in approximately ninety years.

His works are included in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight remarkable Canadians win Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts from the Canada Council for the Arts|url=http://canadacouncil.ca/en/media-arts/news-room/news/2010/governor-generals-awards-in-visual-and-media-arts-%282010%29|work=news release|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant solo exhibition of his work, ''Robert Davidson: The Abstract Edge'', was organized by the [[Museum of Anthropology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) for viewing at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] in 2007.

'''''Saint Jerome Writing''''', also called '''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' or simply '''''Saint Jerome''''', is an [[oil painting]] by [[Italians|Italian]] painter [[Caravaggio]]. Generally dated to 1605-1606, the painting is located in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in [[Rome]].

==Composition==
The painting depicts [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[Roman Catholicism]] and a popular subject for painting, even for Caravaggio, who produced other paintings of Jerome [[Saint Jerome in Meditation (Caravaggio)|in Meditation]] and [[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|engaged in writing]]. In this image, Jerome is reading intently, an outstretched arm resting with quill. It has been suggested that Jerome is depicted in the act of translating the ''Vulgate''.&lt;ref name="Bussagli2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bussagli|first=Marco|title=Italian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80DpE2Y-xlAC&amp;pg=PA346|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=April 2009|publisher=Giunti Editore Firenze Italy|isbn=978-88-09-03726-7|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting is generally dated to 1605-1606, largely on the statements of 17th-century art historical biographer [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], though [[Denis Mahon]] suggests 1602-1604.&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton|title=Caravaggio and His Two Cardinals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WSH4BabKuUC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=1995|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-01312-1|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAvz9G4DhdkC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=5 March 1985|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-06-430128-2|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorenoStefani2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Paolo|author2=Chiara Stefani|title=The Borghese Gallery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce2Fg7FIvFgC&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2000|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-1946-0|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bellori, Caravaggio produced the piece at the behest of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Scipione Borghese]],&lt;ref name="BelloriWohl2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|authorlink1=Giovanni Pietro Bellori|translator=Hellmut Wohl|title=The lives of the modern painters, sculptors and architects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78187-9|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a cardinal in 1605, but it is possible that Borghese acquired it later as it is not mentioned in a 1613 poem by [[Scipione Francucci]] that described the [[Borghese Collection|Borghese Caravaggio collection]].&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"/&gt; Whether or not the dating is accurate, the work is believed to have originated from Caravaggio's late Roman period,&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomella|first=Andrea|title=Caravaggio: An Artist through Images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDH4lOa8qRgC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=ATS Italia Editrice|isbn=978-88-88536-62-0|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended with the painter's exile to [[Malta]] in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''Saint Jerome Writing'' is the work of Caravaggio is sometimes brought into question, as it was attributed to [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]] in the Borghese inventories from 1700 until 1893.&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"/&gt;

''artprofessor.com'' Web. 30 December 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Milan]] in 1947 in which he grandiosely intended to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his ''Manifiesto blanco'' (White Manifesto) published in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. In it he spoke of a new "spatial" art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. It repudiated the illusory or "virtual" space of traditional easel painting and sought to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spatialism little further than the statement that its essence consisted in "plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space". In 1947 Fontana created a "Black Spatial Environment", a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed Environment art. His stabbed and slashed canvases (beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively) are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type (the slash made with a razor blade) is ''Spatial Concept Waiting'' (1960, Tate, [[London]]). Although Fontana's ideas were vague, his outlook was influential, for he was one of the first, certainly the first European artist to truly promote the idea of art as gesture or performance, rather than as the creation of an enduring physical work.

== Cyber-Spatialism ==

In 2005, the Franco-German artist couple Cécile Colle and Ralf Nuhn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imiteme.com/english/en-index.htm|title=Cecile Colle}{Ralf Nuhn EN|first=Cecile Colle - Ralf|last=Nuhn|website=www.imiteme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a series of canvases with computer connectors inserted into them, entitled "Cyber-Spatialism." The project was heavily influenced by Fontana's work. According to the artists, "by substituting Fontana's slashes with computer connectors, Cyber-Spatialism implies an extension of the canvas into cyberspace, and thus attempts to address the notion, that in today's (globalized) culture, real space is increasingly being replaced by virtual space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imiteme.com/english/en-photopages/en-cyber.htm Cyber-Spatialism, 2005.

A '''stereographer''' is a professional in the field of [[stereoscopy]] and [[visual effects]] using the art and techniques of stereo photography, 3D photography, or stereoscopic 3D film to create a visual perception of a 3-dimensional image from a flat surface. 

==Responsibilities==
The role of a stereographer in modern 3D movies can be summarized as:
* Being part of the film (movie) crew, ideally at the script and screen play revision phase for the best 3D experience. If not possible, then at the very least at the Camera and Scene blocking stage
* Creating a depth script for "3D mood" treatment of the movie. This is a creative process with the [[film director|director]], the technical conclusions of which are shared with the [[director of photography]] for final recommendations.
* For modern digital movie projection, also coordinating to a certain extent with [[set designer|set]] and [[costume designer]]s to creatively suggest minimizing of high contrast colors that may cause stereo crosstalk
* On-location co-ordination with the director of photography to assist in stereo framing and implementation of the depth script. A good stereographer knows how to augment but not restrict the cinematographer.
* Suggest [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]]s, cat-in-the-window shots and other time permitting takes to assist the editor with options (footage) to maintain proper depth cuts, during [[post-production]].
* Being present at all post-production sessions to recommend tricks of the trade for unavoidable errors that need to be corrected, and final tweaking of stereo for comfortable viewing.

{{linguistics}}
'''Stylistics''', a branch of [[applied linguistics]], is the study and interpretation of texts of all types and/or spoken language in regard to their linguistic and tonal [[style (sociolinguistics)|style]], where style is the particular [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of language used by different individuals and/or in different situations or settings. For example, the [[vernacular]], or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to [[grammar]], [[accent (sociolinguistics)|pronunciation or accent]], and [[lexicon]] or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and resumé and while speaking during a job interview. 

As a discipline, stylistics link [[literary criticism]] to [[linguistics]]. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of [[literature]] and [[journalism]] as well as [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H.G. 1975. Stylistics and the teaching of literature. Longman: London.  {{ISBN|0-582-55076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul. 2004. Stylistics : A resource book for students. Routledge p. 2: "Stylistics is a method of textual interpretation in which primacy of place is assigned to language".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/7604758/Rape_is_rape_except_when_it_s_not_the_media_recontextualisation_and_violence_against_women Attenborough, F. (2014) 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women', Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict, 2(2): 183-203.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from [[advertising]] copy to [[news]],&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M. (2007) The attraction of opposites: the ideological function of conventional and created oppositions in the construction of in-groups and out-groups in news texts, in L. Jeffries, D. McIntyre, D. Bousfield (eds.) Stylistics and Social Cognition. Amsterdam: Rodopi.&lt;/ref&gt; non-fiction, and [[pop culture|popular culture]], as well as to [[politics|political]] and [[religion|religious]] [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul. 2004. Stylistics: A resource book for students. Routledge p. 3: "The preferred object of study in stylistics is literature, whether that be institutionally sanctioned 'literature' as high art or more popular 'non-canonical' forms of writing.".&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2010) Critical Stylistics. Basingstoke: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; multimodal stylistics&lt;ref&gt;Montoro, R. (2006) Analysting literature through films, in G. Watson, S. Zyngier (eds.) Literature and Stylistics for Language Learners: Theory and Practice. Basingstoke: Palgrave, pp. 48-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mediated stylistics]]&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, F. (2014) Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: recontextualising sexism in the British print press, Journal of Gender Studies, 23(2): 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt; has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as 'a point on a cline rather than as an absolute'.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L., McIntyre, D. (2010) Stylistics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R., Nash, W. (1990) Seeing through Language: a guide to styles of English writing. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of [[genre]], the study of [[folk art]], in the study of spoken [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], and can be applied to areas such as [[discourse analysis]] as well as [[literary criticism]].

Common features of style include the use of [[dialogue]], including regional [[accent (dialect)|accents]] and individual [[dialects]] (or [[ideolects]]), the distribution of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] lengths, the use of particular language registers, and so on. In addition, stylistics is a distinctive term that may be used to determine the connections between the form and effects within a particular variety of language. Therefore, stylistics looks at what is 'going on' within the language; what the linguistic associations are that the style of language reveals.

==Early twentieth century==
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of [[rhetoric|classical rhetoric]], though modern stylistics has its roots in [[Russian Formalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Jeffries, Daniel McIntyre, ''Stylistics'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p 1. {{ISBN|0-521-72869-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague School]] of the early twentieth century.

In 1909, [[Charles Bally]]'s ''Traité de stylistique française'' had proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics. For Bally, Saussure's linguistics by itself couldn't fully describe the language of personal expression.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot J. Taylor, ''Mutual Misunderstanding: Scepticism and the Theorizing of Language and Interpretation'', Duke University Press, 1992, p 91. {{ISBN|0-8223-1249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bally's programme fitted well with the aims of the Prague School.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p 518. {{ISBN|0-89925-356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of ''[[foregrounding]]'', where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of ''deviation'' (from the norms of everyday language) or ''[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Wales, ''A Dictionary of Stylistics'', Pearson Education, 2001, p 315. {{ISBN|0-582-31737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn't constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Pope, ''The English Studies Book: an Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture'', Routledge, 2002, p 88. {{ISBN|0-415-25710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late twentieth century==
[[Roman Jakobson]] had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American [[New Criticism]] in his ''Closing Statement'' at a conference on stylistics at [[Indiana University]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', Routledge, 1993, p 8. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published as ''Linguistics and Poetics'' in 1960, Jakobson's lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 10. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''poetic function'' was one of six general [[Jakobson's functions of language|functions of language]] he described in the lecture.

[[Michael Halliday]] is an important figure in the development of British stylistics.&lt;ref&gt;Raman Selden, ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: From Formalism to Poststructuralism'', Cambridge University Press, 1989, p83. {{ISBN|0-521-30013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1971 study ''Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's '''The Inheritors''''' is a key essay.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Simpson, ''Stylistics: a Resource Book for Students'', Routledge, 2004, p75. {{ISBN|0-415-28104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Halliday's contributions has been the use of the term [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] to explain the connections between language and its context.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday register is distinct from [[dialect]]. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user,&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 12. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; choices which depend on three variables: ''field'' ("what the participants... are actually engaged in doing", for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Butler, ''Structure and Function: a Guide to Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, p 373. {{ISBN|1-58811-361-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[tenor (linguistics)|tenor]]'' (who is taking part in the exchange) and ''mode'' (the use to which the language is being put).

Fowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of [[vocabulary]] (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist [[David Crystal]] points out that Halliday's 'tenor' stands as a roughly equivalent term for 'style', which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday's third category, ''mode'', is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the [[genre]] of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist [[William Downes (linguist)|William Downes]] makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).

==Literary stylistics==
In ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'', Crystal observes that, in practice, most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and 'valued' language within literature, i.e. 'literary stylistics'. He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of [[literary language]], for instance, its 'deviant' and abnormal features, rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses. For example, the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the [[stylistician]] than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal. 1987, 71).

===Poetry===
As well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional – the most obvious of which is [[poetry]]. In ''Practical Stylistics'', [[Henry Widdowson|HG Widdowson]] examines the traditional form of the [[epitaph]], as found on headstones in a cemetery. For example:&lt;br&gt;
:His memory is dear today
:As in the hour he passed away.
:(Ernest C. Draper 'Ern'. Died 4.1.38)
:(Widdowson. 1992, 6)

Widdowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as 'crude verbal carvings' and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson, 3). Nevertheless, Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member. However, what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic [[phraseology]] but in where it appears. The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed. Widdowson suggests that, unlike words set in stone in a graveyard, poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with inter-textual implications (Widdowson. 1992, 4).

Two problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by [[PM Wetherill]] in ''Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods''. The first is that there may be an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).

===Implicature===
In '[[Poetic Effects]]' from ''Literary Pragmatics'', the [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Adrian Pilkington]] analyses the idea of '[[implicature]]', as instigated in the previous work of [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]]. Implicature may be divided into two categories: 'strong' and 'weak' implicature, yet between the two extremes there are a variety of other alternatives. The strongest implicature is what is emphatically implied by the speaker or writer, while weaker implicatures are the wider possibilities of meaning that the hearer or reader may conclude.

Pilkington's '[[poetic effects]]', as he terms the concept, are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply 'read in' by the hearer or reader. Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or reader's conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective. As Pilkington says: 'there is no clear cut-off point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearer's responsibility.' (Pilkington. 1991, 53) In addition, the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkington's poetic effects in understanding a poem's meaning.

===Tense===
Widdowson points out that in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]" (1798), the mystery of the Mariner's abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense. (Widdowson. 1992, 40) For instance, the Mariner 'holds' the wedding-guest with his 'skinny hand' in the [[present tense]], but releases it in the [[past tense]] ('...his hands dropt he.'); only to hold him again, this time with his 'glittering eye', in the present (Widdowson. 1992, 41).

===The point of poetry===
Widdowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised, it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations, such as 'nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes', and so on (Widdowson. 1992, 9). But to say:&lt;br&gt;
:Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
:So do our minutes hasten to their end ...
:William Shakespeare, '60'.
Or, indeed:&lt;br&gt;
:Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
:Nor hours, days months, which are the rags of time ...
:[[John Donne]], '[[The Sun Rising]]', ''Poems'' (1633)
This language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson. 1992, 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like 'love', 'heart' and 'soul' to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (Widdowson. 1992, 76).

The '''Symphony No. 6''' is a composition for [[mezzo-soprano]] solo and [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[John Harbison]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[James Levine]].  It was composed in 2011 and was given its world premiere in [[Boston]] on January 12, 2012 by the mezzo-soprano [[Paula Murrihy]] and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of [[David Zinman]].  The piece is dedicated "in friendship and gratitude" to James Levine, who would have conducted the premiere had he not retired from his post as the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra due to health concerns.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbison |first=John |authorlink=John Harbison |year=2011 |title=Symphony No. 6 |publisher=[[G.

==Composition==

===Background===
Harbison was affected by the premature retirement of the conductor James Levine from his longtime post at the Boston Symphony Orchestra; the composer thus reworked the symphony to reflect the sadness of the occasion.  In an interview with the ''Boston Classical Review'', Harbison remarked, "The character of it seemed to be... out of harmony with the sense of Mr. Levine's current situation where he's had to give up so much of what he wanted to do.  I kind of went back and reconstructed the sequences of events and eliminated some things and put some other things in."  Harbison particularly described the original draft of the first movement as the "least appropriate" for the event of Levine's departure, commenting, "It was a very self-assured, aggressive piece and I felt like I couldn't find the character of the piece moving away from that vantage point. I also felt like it was the kind of movement I had written before."&lt;ref name="BCR" /&gt;

The reworked first movement is instead set to the text of "Entering the Temple in Nimes" by the American poet [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]] and is the only movement of the piece requiring the mezzo-soprano.  Harbison wrote in the score program notes, "The concluding lines of the poem are rendered in terms which define much of the rest of the piece."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in four [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Con moto
#Introduzione – Con anima – Grazioso
#Vivo, Ruvido
#Moderato cantabile e semplice

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a solo mezzo-soprano and a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], two percussionists, [[cimbalom]] (or [[prepared piano]]), [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been praised by music critics.  Reviewing the world premiere concert, David Wright of ''The Classical Review'' wrote, "The program also included works by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]], but, as intended, Harbison's symphony left the strongest impression of the evening."  Wright added, "It is a masterpiece of mixed emotions, still showing signs of the confident, robust tribute to James Levine that Harbison intended to write, yet colored throughout by recollection of its wistful first movement—the one the composer says he changed the most in response to the news of Levine's departure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=David |title=Zinman leads Boston Symphony in powerful Harbison premiere |work=The Classical Review |date=January 13, 2012 |url=http://theclassicalreview.com/2012/01/zinman-leads-boston-symphony-in-powerful-harbison-premiere/ |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew Guerrieri of ''[[NewMusicBox]]'' further remarked:{{quote|Harbison is, on the one hand, a composer of symphonies with a technique to match: the bend-but-don't-break tonality, the chain-of-custody working out of ideas, the cultivation of a monumental austerity in his orchestration. But he also seemed, in this symphony, to be more comfortable weighing musical options than flat-out asserting them. Those points in the symphony that seemed to spin off into a kind of considered ambivalence were not only the most engaging, but also cast the rest of the piece in a more fertile light. Maybe it was a reflection of the overwhelming sense of unfinished business surrounding Levine's tenure and departure, or maybe of something in the composer's own temperament, but Harbison's Sixth was hard to put a finger on in a most interesting way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerrieri |first=Matthew |title=New England's Prospect: The Haunted Mansion |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/new-englands-prospect-the-haunted-mansion/ |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Disasters of War''''' (Spanish: '''''Los desastres de la guerra''''') is a series of 82&lt;ref group=a&gt;80 prints in the first published edition (1863), for which the last two plates were not available. See "[[#Execution|Execution]]".&lt;/ref&gt; [[old master print|prints]] created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and [[Printmaking|printmaker]] [[Francisco Goya]] (1746–1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]], the subsequent [[Peninsular War]] of 1808–14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy]] in 1814. During the conflicts between [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and Spain, Goya retained his position as first [[court painter]] to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers.&lt;ref name="Bareau, 45"&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath.&lt;ref name="S129"&gt;Sayre, 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons.&lt;ref name = "Jones 2003"&gt;Jones, Jonathan. "[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/31/artsfeatures.turnerprize2003 Look what we did]". ''The Guardian'', 31 March 2003. Retrieved 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most [[print room]] collections have at least some of the set.

The name by which the series is known today is not Goya's own. His handwritten title on an album of [[Artist's proof|proofs]] given to a friend reads: '''''Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices''''' (Spanish: '''''Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos''''').&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 48–9. This is the title of the album given to [[Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez]], written by Goya himself (illustrated Wilson-Bareau, 44), although the series is always referred to by the title given to the published set.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks from a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.

They fight with their fists and with swords.|Plate 4: ''Las mujeres dan valor'' (''The women are courageous''). A struggle between civilians and soldiers]]

The series was produced using a variety of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printmaking]] techniques, mainly [[etching]] for the line work and [[aquatint]] for the tonal areas, but also [[engraving]] and [[drypoint]]. As with many other Goya prints, they are sometimes referred to as aquatints, but more often as etchings. The series is usually considered in three groups which broadly mirror the order of their creation. The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811–12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and opposed both state and religious reform. Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the "prodigious flowering of rage"&lt;ref name="C175"&gt;Connell, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  The serial nature in which the plates unfold has led some to see the images as similar in nature to photography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryant, Clifton]].

==Historical background==
[[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[First Consul]] of the [[French Republic]] on 18 February 1799, and was crowned Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, it was politically and strategically important to the French. The reigning Spanish sovereign, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles&amp;nbsp;IV]], was internationally regarded as ineffectual,&lt;ref name="C1456"&gt;Connell, 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; and his position at the time was threatened by his pro-British heir, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Crown Prince Ferdinand]]. Napoleon took advantage of Charles's weak standing by suggesting the two nations conquer Portugal—the spoils to be divided equally between France, Spain and the Spanish Prime Minister, [[Manuel de Godoy]], who would take the title "Prince of the [[Algarve]]". Seduced by the French offer, Godoy accepted, failing to detect the true motivations of either Napoleon or Ferdinand, who both intended to use the invasion as a ploy, to seize power in Spain.&lt;ref name="C1456" /&gt;

[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|left|thumb|In ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', along with its companion work ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'', Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to Napoleon's armies during the occupation of 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer.

Philadelphia: McCarty and Davis, 1835. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas.&lt;ref name="C1456" /&gt; In 1808, [[Mutiny of Aranjuez|a popular uprising]]—incited by Ferdinand's supporters—saw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to [[abdication|abdicate]]; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;VII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage,&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Charles William. "War and peace in an age of upheaval: 1793–1830". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965. 443–444&lt;/ref&gt; but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal [[Joachim Murat]], believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. They decided that Napoleon's brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], should be king.&lt;ref name="l109"&gt;Licht, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to [[Bayonne]], France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.

Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the [[French Revolution]], and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from [[feudalism]] to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.&lt;ref name="Shaw482"&gt;Shaw, 482&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Goya's friends, including the poets [[Juan Meléndez Valdés]] and [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], were overt {{lang|es|[[afrancesado]]s}}: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte.&lt;ref name="Bareau, 45"/&gt; He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 129&lt;/ref&gt; and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops.&lt;ref group=a&gt;That Goya had first-hand knowledge of events depicted in ''The Disasters of War'' is implied by the title of the print ''I saw it''.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Both the Bonaparte allegory and Wellington's medals and orders required updating soon after to reflect the changing situation&amp;nbsp;– Wilson-Bareau, 45, and, for Wellington, Neil MacLaren, revised Allan Braham, ''The Spanish School, National Gallery Catalogues''. National Gallery London, 1970. 16–20. {{ISBN|0-947645-46-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for ''The Disasters of War''. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as "{{lang|es|el desmembramiento d'España}}"—the dismemberment of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Waring, Belle; Fee, Elizabeth. "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1470451 The Disasters of War]". ''American Journal of Public'', Volume 96, Issue 1, January 2006. 51. Retrieved on 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plates==
Art historians broadly agree that ''The Disasters of War'' is divided into three thematic groupings—war, famine, and political and cultural allegories. This sequence broadly reflects the order in which the plates were created. Few of the plates or drawings are dated; instead, their chronology has been established by identifying specific incidents to which the plates refer,&lt;ref name="H273"&gt;Hughes (2004), 273&lt;/ref&gt; and the different batches of plates used, which allow sequential groups to be divined. For the most part, Goya's numbering agrees with these other methods.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 49–51, 57–99&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several exceptions. For example, [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (01).jpg|plate 1]] was among the last to be completed, after the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 49–59, discusses the sequences of subjects and dates of creation in detail. For plate 1, see 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early plates of the war grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images typically show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, the distinction between the Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, ''Con razon ó sin ella'' can mean ''with or without reason'', ''rightly or wrongly'', or ''for something or for nothing''. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime".&lt;ref name="Shaw482" /&gt; There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.

Plates 1 to 47 consist mainly of realistic depictions of the horrors of the war fought against the French. Most portray the aftermath of battle; they include mutilated torsos and limbs mounted on trees, like "fragments of marble sculpture".&lt;ref name="C175" /&gt; Both French and Spanish troops tortured and mutilated captives; evidence of such acts is minutely detailed across a number of Goya's plates.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, Maisah.

The group begins with ''[[commons:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 01 - Tristes presentimientos de lo que ha de acontecer.jpg|Tristes presentimientos de lo que ha de acontecer]]'' (''Gloomy presentiments of what must come to pass''), in which a man kneels in the darkness with outstretched arms. The following plates describe combat with the French, who—according to art critic Vivien Raynor—are depicted "rather like [[Cossacks]], bayoneting civilians", while Spanish civilians are shown "poleaxing the French."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Raynor, Vivien. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/25/nyregion/art-goya-s-disasters-of-war-grisly-indictment-of-humanity.html Goya's 'Disasters of War': Grisly Indictment of Humanity]". ''New York Times'', 25 February 1990. Retrieved 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Plates 31 to 39 focus on atrocities and were produced on the same batch of plates as the famine group.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Others are based on drawings Goya had completed in his ''Sketchbook-journal'', in studies where he examined the theme of the grotesque body in relation to the iconography of the tortured or martyred one. In his India ink wash drawing ''We cannot look at this'' (1814–24), he examined the idea of a humiliated inverted body with pathos and tragedy, as he did to comical effect in ''[[commons:File:Goja Kukla.jpg|The Straw Mannequin]]'' (1791–92).&lt;ref name="S&amp;C89"&gt;Stoichita and Coderch, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's rejects the ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on individual participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots.&lt;ref&gt;Stoichita and Coderch, 95&lt;/ref&gt; The exception is [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (07).jpg|plate 7]], ''Que valor!'' (''What courage!''), which depicts [[Agustina de Aragón]] (1786–1857), the heroine of [[Zaragoza]], who brought food to the [[cannon]]eers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Charles M. ''Liberty Or Death!''. Bloomington, Indiana: Trafford Publishing, 2008. 67. {{ISBN|1-4251-5852-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself.&lt;ref name="C162"&gt;Connell, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is agreed that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes it may have been his visit to Zaragoza in the lull between the [[Siege of Saragossa (1808)|first]] and [[Siege of Saragossa (1809)|second]] phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 287–288&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group, plates 48 to 64, detail the effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 297–299; Wilson-Bareau, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In these plates, Goya's focus is directed away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.

Goya does not focus on the reasons for the shortage, nor does he apportion blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population.&lt;ref name="H297"&gt;Hughes (2004), 297&lt;/ref&gt; Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes believes [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (50).jpg|plate 50]], ''Madre infeliz!'' (''Unhappy mother!''), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents "a darkness that seems to be the very essence of loss and orphanhood".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004, 299"&gt;Hughes (2004), 299&lt;/ref&gt; This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 51&lt;/ref&gt; A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of [[aquatint]] in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were [[Burnishing (metal)|burnish]]ed.&lt;ref name="S129"/&gt;

Plates 65 to 82 were named "caprichos enfáticos" ("emphatic [[Capriccio (painting)|caprices]]") in the original series title.&lt;ref group=a&gt;"Caprichos enfáticos" is difficult to translate; in the 18th century language of [[rhetoric]], "emphatic" suggests that these prints "make a point or give a warning by insinuation rather than by direct statement"—Wilson-Bareau, 59, quoting from an undisclosed source. Wilson-Bareau adds that "enfáticos" is also often translated as "striking". In talking about art, "Caprice", usually found today as the original Italian [[Capriccio (painting)|capriccio]], normally suggests light-hearted fantasy, which does not characterise these prints or ''[[Los Caprichos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII's fall and return to power, they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post-war Spanish politics, including the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] and the then-common judicial practice of torture. Although peace was welcomed, it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before. The new regime stifled the hopes of liberals such as Goya, who used the term "fatal consequences" to describe the situation in his title for the series.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 57–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;Cannizzo, Stephanie.

After the six years of [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] that followed Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, [[Rafael del Riego]] initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after [[Trienio Liberal|an unstable period]], a [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French invasion]] supported by [[Quintuple Alliance|an alliance of the major powers]] had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 57–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier ''[[Caprichos]]''. [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (75).jpg|Plate 75]] ''Farándula de charlatanes'' (''Troupe of charlatans'') shows a priest with a parrot's head performing before an audience of donkeys and monkeys.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (77).jpg|plate 77]], a pope walking a tightrope was "prudently reduced" to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863.&lt;ref name=b59&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Some prints showing animal scenes seem to draw from a satirical verse fable by [[Giovanni Battista Casti]], published in Italian in 1802; the ''[[Animal Farm]]'' of its day. In plate 74, the wolf, representing a minister, quotes from the fable—"Miserable humanity, the fault is thine"—and signs with Casti's name. The print "lays the blame for their rulers' barbarity on the victims' own acceptance of it".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 59. See also plate 77 in the gallery at bottom.&lt;/ref&gt;

(''This is no less curious'')|alt=Three elderly men strain under the weight of the church statue that they carry upon their shoulders.

A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards [[idolatry]] of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and [[procession]]al images, are mocked and denigrated. [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 67 - Esta no lo es menos.jpg|Plate 67]], ''Esta no lo es menos'' (''This is no less curious''&lt;!--"curious" only makes sense if viewed with plate 66--&gt;), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the "Virgin of Solitude". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, "It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations." Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were "illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form".&lt;ref name="S&amp;C9092"&gt;Stoichita and Coderch, 90–92&lt;/ref&gt;

The published edition of ''The Disasters of War'' ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a [[wreath]], intended as a personification of [[Allegory of Hispania|Spain]], Truth, or the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]]—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814.&lt;ref name=b59/&gt; In [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 79 - Murió la Verdad.jpg|plate 79]], ''Murió la Verdad'' (''The Truth has died''), she lies dead. In [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 80 - Si resucitará?.jpg|plate 80]], ''Si resucitará?'' (''Will she live again?''), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of "monks and monsters".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 59 (quotation)&lt;/ref&gt; In plate 82, ''Esto es lo verdadero'' (''This is the true way''), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;Of the last two prints, Licht writes, "[Goya's] otherwise authoritative hand begins to hesitate, and he creates the two weakest plates in the entire series. Therein, perhaps, lies ''his'' strength: He cannot delude himself." Licht, 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, mostly in [[Sanguine|red chalk]], have survived and are numbered differently from the published prints.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; He produced two albums of proofs—among many individual proof impressions—of which only one is complete.&lt;ref group=a&gt;The most important collection of individual proofs was acquired in Spain by [[Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet]] from [[Valentín Carderera]], who probably got them from Goya's grandson. In 1951, they were sold to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. Wilson-Bareau, 99. This collection includes a unique unfinished and unpublished print from the first group: ''Infame provecho (Vile Advantage)'', Boston MFA Accession number: 51.1697&lt;/ref&gt; The full album consists of 85 works, including three small ''Prisioneros'' ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which are not part of the series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the [[British Museum]], to his friend [[Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez]]. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier—who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain—to the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director. Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Spanish National Library [http://servicios.bne.es/productos/Goya/es_home_desastres.html web page on the series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614050206/http://servicios.bne.es/productos/Goya/es_home_desastres.html |date=2009-06-14 }} {{es icon}}.

A woman holding one child in her arm reaches for another who has fallen to the ground; as an army approaches.]]

As the series progressed, Goya evidently began to experience shortages of good quality paper and copper plates, and was forced to take what art historian [[Juliet Wilson-Bareau]] calls the "drastic step" of destroying two depicting landscapes, from which very few impressions had been printed. These were cut in half to produce four of ''The Disasters of War''{{'}}s prints.&lt;ref name="B50"&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 50&lt;/ref&gt; Partly because of the material shortages, the sizes and shapes of the plates vary somewhat, ranging from as small as 142 × 168&amp;nbsp;mm (5.6 × 6.6&amp;nbsp;in) to as large as 163 × 260&amp;nbsp;mm (6.4 × 10.2&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref group=a&gt;Plates [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 14 - Duro es el paso!.jpg|14]] and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 24 - Aun podrán servir.jpg|24]], respectively. See the Spanish National Library website for measurements.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goya completed 56 plates during the [[Peninsular War|war against France]], and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch—including plate 1, several in the middle of the series, and the last 17 plates—are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: ''I saw this'' ([[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 44 - Yo lo vi.jpg|plate 44]]) and ''One can not look'' ([[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 26 - No se puede mirar.jpg|plate 26]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Boime|Boime, Albert]].

The University of Chicago Press, 1990. 307–308. {{ISBN|0-226-06335-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand.&lt;ref name="C175" /&gt; It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on [[Copper engraving|copper plate]] once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches.&lt;ref name="C175" /&gt; All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.&lt;ref name="Bareau, 57"&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The titles of a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes themselves are not related. Examples include plates [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 02 - Con razon ó sin ella.jpg|2]] and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 03 - Lo mismo.jpg|3]] (''With or without reason'' and ''The same''), [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 04 - Las mugeres dan valor.jpg|4]] and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 05 - Y son fieras.jpg|5]] (''The women are courageous'' and ''And they are fierce''), and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 9 - No quieren.jpg|9]], [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 10 - Tampoco.jpg|10]] and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 11 - Ni por esas.jpg|11]] (''They do not want to'', ''Nor these'' and ''Or these''). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 46 - Esto es malo.jpg|46]] and [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 47 - Así sucedió.jpg|47]] (''This is bad'' and ''This is how it happened''), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory.

The Bermúdez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed,&lt;ref group=a&gt;The title of [[commons:File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 69 - Nada. Ello dirá.jpg|plate 69]] was altered as "apparently&amp;nbsp;... too nihilistic" from Goya's ''Nada. Ello lo dice'' to ''Nada. Ello dirá'' (Wilson-Bareau, 57).&lt;/ref&gt; one plate had work added, and the printing was carried out with much more ink on the plates (producing "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 46–49&lt;/ref&gt; The Bermúdez set is considered "uniquely important&amp;nbsp;... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed".&lt;ref name="B50" /&gt; There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small ''Prisioneros'').

''The Disasters of War'' was not published during Goya's lifetime, possibly because he feared political repercussions from Fernando VII's repressive regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;It has been suggested that Goya numbered the initial set of 56 plates in 1814, during a few months of national optimism following the end of the war, with the intent of publishing them then. However, on 11 May 1814, Fernando&amp;nbsp;VII declared that the war would be forgotten and nullified the constitution, making publication impossible (Sayre, 128–129).&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians suggest that he did not publish because he was sceptical about the use of images for political motives, and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release. Most, however, believe the artist preferred to wait until they could be made public without censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Stoichita and Coderch, 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;Licht speculates, "These plates obviously had to be created by the artist without any further thought about their ultimate purpose. Goya never intended them for publication during his lifetime." (Licht, 128). Wilson-Bareau and Hughes disagree, see Wilson-Bareau p.59 and ''passim'' in chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A further four editions were published, the last in 1937, so that in total  over 1,000 impressions of each print have been printed, though not all of the same quality. As with his other series, later impressions show wear to the aquatint.  The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937.  Many sets have been broken up, and most [[print room]] collections will have at least some of the set.  Examples, especially from later editions, are available on the art market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaightwoodgalleries.com/Pages/Goya_Desastres.html Spaightwood Galleries] accessed October 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Spanish novelist [[Antonio de Trueba]] published the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on the genesis of the series. de Trueba claims to have spoken to Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of [[Principe Pio]] to sketch the victims of the [[The Third of May 1808|executions of 3 May 1808]].&lt;ref group=a&gt;"As midnight approached, my master said, 'Isidro, take your gun and come with me.' I obeyed him and where do you think we went?—To that hill where the bodies of those poor people still lay&amp;nbsp;.... My master opened his portfolio, put it on his lap and waited for the moon to come out from behind the large cloud that was hiding it&amp;nbsp;.... At last the moon shone so brightly that it seemed like daylight. Amidst the pools of blood, we could make out some of the corpses—some lying on their backs, others on their bellies; this one in a kneeling position, that one with his arms raised toward heaven, begging for vengeance or mercy&amp;nbsp;.... While I stared at the terrible scene, filled with dread, my master drew it. We returned home and the next morning my master showed me his first print of ''La Guerra'', which I looked at in horror. 'Sir,' I asked him, 'Why do you draw these barbarities which men commit?' He replied, 'To warn men not to be barbarians ever again.' "Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente; Licht et al, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a "romantic fantasy", and detailed its many inaccuracies.&lt;ref group=a&gt;In a BBC television documentary, Glendinning said: "Trueba is clearly romanticising the artist, making the artist fearless and heroic, I mean not to just observe through the spy glass these terrible things that are happening, but actually going to see them&amp;nbsp;... None of this corresponds at all to the reality of the shootings. Because we know the shootings took place at four or five o'clock in the morning. Some modern experts point out it was also raining, and so the idea that Goya is going out at midnight, he's not going to see anything. None of this fits with historical information we have." Glendinning also pointed out that Trueba places Goya in his house known as ''Quinta del Sordo''. Goya moved into this house in 1819, after the war, casting further doubt on Trueba's version.

==Technique and style==
Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of [[Diego Velázquez]] to [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937). Reflecting on ''The Disasters of War'', biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth "be seen and&amp;nbsp;... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it&amp;nbsp;.... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say."&lt;ref name="C175" /&gt; The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the [[Eighty Years' War]] with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like [[Hans Baldung]]. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by [[Jacques Callot]] known as ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' (1633), which record the devastating impact on [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIII]]'s troops during the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Becker DP; in Spangeberg, Kristin (ed). ''Six Centuries of Master Prints''. Cincinnati: [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], 1993. 154. {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 37 - Esto es peor.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A dismembered and mutilated corpse is impaled on the branches of a tree.|Plate 37: ''Esto es peor'' (''[[This is worse]]''). In the aftermath of battle, the mutilated torsos and limbs of civilian victims were mounted on trees, like "fragments of marble sculpture".&lt;ref name="C175" /&gt;]]

The dead man in plate 37, ''[[This is worse|Esto es peor]]'' (''This is worse''), forms a mutilated body of a Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers. It is based in part on the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] fragment of a male nude, the ''[[Belvedere Torso]]'' by the Athenian "Apollonios son of Nestor". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In ''Esto es peor'' he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre&amp;nbsp;– the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing.&lt;ref name="S&amp;C95"&gt;Stoichita and Coderch, 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, during the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Cottom, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] remarked that the figures in this image "remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Menges]] would have been in aesthetic raptures over them."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Goya abandons colour in the series, believing that light, shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, "In art there is no need for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait."&lt;ref name ="Holland253" /&gt; He uses line not so much to delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, "to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste&amp;nbsp;.... This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged."&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, 254&lt;/ref&gt; The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature. He was not the first to work in this manner; [[Rembrandt]] had sought a similar directness, but did not have access to aquatint. [[William Blake]] and [[Henry Fuseli]], contemporaries of Goya's, produced works with similarly fantastical content, but, as Hollander describes, they muted its disturbing impact with "exquisitely applied linearity&amp;nbsp;... lodging it firmly in the safe citadels of beauty and rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, 254–55&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1947 book on Goya's etchings, English author [[Aldous Huxley]] observed that the images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes: darkened archways "more sinister than those even of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s ''Prisons''"; street corners as settings for the cruelty of the disparities of class; and silhouetted hilltops carrying the dead, sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses. "And so the record proceeds, horror after horror, unalleviated by any of the splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war; for, significantly, Goya never illustrates an engagement, never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in the order of battle&amp;nbsp;.... All he shows us is war's disasters and squalors, without any of the glory or even picturesqueness."&lt;ref name="h12-13"&gt;Huxley, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Disasters of War'' is the second of Goya's four major print series, which constitute almost all of his most important work in the medium. He also created 35 prints early in his career—many of which are reproductions of his portraits and other works—and about 16 [[lithograph]]s while living in France.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, Chapter 2. See also the listings of Harris catalogue numbers for all the prints on 100–106&lt;/ref&gt; Goya created his first series, the 80-plate ''[[Caprichos]]'', between 1797 and 1799 to document "the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and&amp;nbsp;... the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 181. Wilson-Bareau, 23–26 for dates.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caprichos'' was put on sale in 1799, but was almost immediately withdrawn after threats from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Disasters of War''{{'}}s first two groups of prints, Goya largely departs from the imaginative, synthetic approach of ''Caprichos'' to realistically depict life-and-death scenes of war. In the last group, the ''Caprichos'' sense of the fantastic returns.[[File:Prado - Los Disparates (1864) - No. 13 - Modo de volar.jpg|thumb|Plate 13 from the "Disparate" series; ''Modo de volar'' (''Way to fly''), 1816–1823. In the third grouping of plates in ''The Disasters of War'' Goya returned in part to the fantastical imagery he had explored in the ''Caprichos''.|alt=Four or five men fly with contraptions resembling bat's wings attached to their arms.]]

Between 1815 and 1816, Goya produced the ''[[La Tauromaquia|Tauromachia]]'', a series of 33 [[bullfighting]] scenes, during a break from ''The Disasters of War''. ''Tauromachia'' was not politically sensitive, and was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320—for sale individually or in sets—without incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 61, 64, and 67&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Goya completed a set of four larger lithographs, ''[[commons:Category:Los toros de Burdeos|Los toros de Burdeos]]'' (''The Bulls of Bordeaux'').&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 91–95&lt;/ref&gt; His final series, known as ''[[Los Disparates]]'' (''The Follies''), ''Proverbios'' (''Proverbs''), or ''Sueños'' (''Dreams''), contains 22 large plates and at least five drawings that are seemingly part of the series but which were never etched. All these were left in Madrid—apparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed—when Goya went to France in 1823. One plate is known to have been etched in 1816, but little else is established about the chronology of the works, or Goya's plans for the set.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Bareau, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Goya worked on ''The Disasters of War'' during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Goya's introspection late in this period can be witnessed in the enigmatic ''[[Black Paintings]]'' which he painted directly onto the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823.&lt;/ref&gt; His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to the imagery of the ''Caprichos''. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.&lt;ref name ="Holland253"&gt;Hollander, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
In ''The Disasters of War'', Goya does not excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the consolation of divine order or the dispensation of human justice.&lt;ref name="l130-152"&gt;Licht, 130–152&lt;/ref&gt; This in part a result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in [[Baroque]] martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.&lt;ref name="l132-142"&gt;Licht, 132–142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Hanging by Jacques Callot.jpg|left|thumb|''La Pendaison'' (''The Hanging''), a plate from French artist [[Jacques Callot]]'s 1623 series ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]''. It is likely that Callot's etchings of a disorderly army were an influence on Goya.|alt=The bodies of captive men hang from trees while soldiers and civilians look on. A man to the right comforts a woman.]]

The plates are set spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the picture plane in all directions.&lt;ref name="l132-142"/&gt; Thus, they express the randomness of violence, and in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th- and 20th-century [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref name="l130-133, 143-144"&gt;Licht, 130–133, 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier ''Caprichos'' series, ''The Disasters of War'' is likely to have been intended as a "social speech"; satires on the then prevailing "hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [and] the absence of wisdom" of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="H263"&gt;Hughes (1990), 63&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believed Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness.&lt;ref name="H263" /&gt;

His message late in life is contrary to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying that violence is innate in man, "forged in the substance of what, since [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], we have called the [[id, ego, and super-ego|id]]." Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of [[The Dog (Goya)|Goya's dog]], "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1990), 64&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Disasters of War'' plates are preoccupied with wasted bodies, undifferentiated body parts, castration and female abjection. There are dark erotic undertones to a number of the works. Connell notes the innate sexuality of the image in plate 7—[[Agustina de Aragón]]'s igniting a long cannon.&lt;ref name="C162" /&gt; The art historian Lennard Davis suggests that Goya was fascinated with the "erotics of dismemberment",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, 485&lt;/ref&gt; while Hughes mentions [[commons:File:Prado - Los Disparates - No. 10 - El caballo raptor.jpg|plate 10]] in ''Los disparates'', which shows a woman carried in the grip of a horse's mouth. To Hughes, the woman's euphoria suggests, among other possible meanings, orgasm.&lt;ref name="H263" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, ''The Disasters of War'' had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy of San Fernando]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on [[Théodore Géricault]],&lt;ref name="H51"&gt;Hughes (1990), 51&lt;/ref&gt; best known for the politically charged ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–19). [[Luis Buñuel]] identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 ''[[L'Age d'Or|L'Âge d'Or]]'', on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]''.&lt;ref name="H51" /&gt;

The series' impact on Dalí is evident in ''[[Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)]]'', painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (39).jpg|plate 39]], ''Grande hazaña! Con muertos!'' (''A heroic feat! With dead men!''), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.&lt;ref name="l151"&gt;Licht, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] of the [[Young British Artists]] movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on ''The Disasters of War''. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=26398&amp;searchid=12001 Disasters of War 1993]. [[Tate]]. Retrieved 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate ''Grande hazaña! Con muertos!''.
In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of ''The Disasters of War''. They purchased a complete set of prints,&lt;ref name = "Jones 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;An edition that had been published in 1937, as a protest against [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|fascist atrocities]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;/ref&gt; over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads.&lt;ref&gt;Jake and Dinos Chapman.

[[File:Boums.JPG|thumb |alt=Boums lake |Boums Lake in [[Haute-Garonne]], one of the many lakes near Toulouse suspected to have held the 'cursed' riches]]

The '''Gold of Tolosa''' (also the '''''aurum Tolosanum''''') existed as a hoard of treasures plundered from Greece (allegedly the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]]) in 279 BC by [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invaders]] of the [[Volcae]] (often denoted incorrectly as [[Galatians (People)|Galatians]], despite the later migration of some Volcae Tectosagi to Galatia). It was often noted that, during the siege of Apollo's sanctuary at Delphi, the Gallic leader, [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]], was badly wounded (many contemporary sources state some kind of [[divine]] intervention, and the battle was lost against a combined force of [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], [[Triballi]] and [[Illyrians]]). Many, after their fortunes reversed, retreated back into the Balkans, some to the Volcae heartlands, and many others back to Gaul itself, dumping their plunder into the lakes near Tolosa (modern-day [[Toulouse]]), believing that the loot was cursed. The faltering of Brennus's ''great expedition'', however, helped create the Gallic exclaves around [[Tylis]] and in [[Galatia]], the latter of which remaining ''de facto'' independent for centuries to come. 

For the curse to be lifted, according to Celtic [[paganism]], the treasure had to be offered back to the Celtic gods, and so was left in the lakes. Other guilty warriors hid their treasure in the vegetation around the lakes. The lakes at Tolosa were used many years thereafter as a place of pagan worship, but nobody (who believed in the curse) dared recover the glinting treasures from the sandy lake bed. Some of the treasures, however, did find their way into the temples of Tolosa, but the same religious taboo of their theft still presided.

== Roman history of Tolosa and Strabo's account ==
[[File:Volcae Arecomisci and Tectosages (migrations).svg|thumb |alt=The course of Volcae migration in the 3rd centuries BC |The course of Volcae tribal migration throughout the 3rd centuries BC, noting the destination of some Tectosages and the Arecomisci to the area around Tolosa]]

''And it is further said that the [Volcae] ''Tectosages'' shared in the expedition to [[Delphi]];  and even the treasures that were found among them in the city of [[Toulouse]] by [[Quintus Servilius Caepio|Caepio]], a general of the Romans, were, it is said, a part of the valuables that were taken from [[Delphi]], although the people, in trying to consecrate them and propitiate the god, added thereto out of their personal properties, and it was on account of having laid hands on them that Caepio ended his life in misfortunes — for he was cast out by his native land as a temple-robber, and he left behind as his heirs female children only, who, as it turned out, became prostitutes, as [[Timagenes]] has said, and therefore perished in disgrace.''  [Note that Strabo here is mistaken, since Caepio did have a [[Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger|son]], the maternal grandfather of [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], the principal assassin of [[Julius Caesar]].]

However, in 105 BC, the proconsul of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]], reported the discovery of the gold at Tolosa to the Senate, and was charged with sending the treasure back to Rome. Over 50,000 15&amp;nbsp;lb. bars of gold and 10,000 15&amp;nbsp;lb. bars of silver were found. The gold disappeared en route, with Strabo mentioning that "''it was on account of laying hands on them that Caepio ended his life in misfortunes...''". It was reported that the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, with many contemporaries and modern historians believing that Caepio himself had hired them. Indeed, Caepio did go on to lose the [[Battle of Arausio]] by his hubris, and was prosecuted for corruption by the Senate. He spent the rest of his days in exile at [[Smyrna]], tried for the loss of his army by [[Gaius Norbanus]]. The curse was reported to have continued with his son, [[Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger]], who fought for Rome in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. He barely escaped an accusation of ''maiestas'' ('diminution of the majesty of the people of Rome') after disputing with the tribune [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] who was also his brother-in-law, and ''princeps senatus'' [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]]. Caepio perished in an ambush executed by the general [[Quintus Poppaedius Silo]]. The gold of Tolosa itself was never found, and was said to have been passed all the way down to the last heir of the ''Caepiones'', [[Marcus Junius Brutus]].

''But however, the account of [[Poseidonius]] is more plausible:  for he says that the treasure that was found in Tolosa amounted to about fifteen thousand talents (part of it in sacred lakes), unwrought, that is, merely gold and silver bullion;  whereas the temple at Delphi was in those times already empty of such treasure, because it had been robbed at the time of the sacred war by the [[Phocians]];  but even if something was left, it was divided by many among themselves;  neither is it reasonable to suppose that they reached their homeland in safety, since they fared wretchedly after their retreat from Delphi and, because of their dissensions, were scattered, some in one direction, others in another.  But, as has been said both by Poseidonius and several others, since the country was rich in gold, and also belonged to people who were god-fearing and not extravagant in their ways of living, it came to have treasures in many places in Celtica;  but it was the lakes, most of all, that afforded the treasures their inviolability, into which the people let down heavy masses of silver or even of gold.   At all events, the Romans, after they mastered the regions, sold the lakes for the public treasury, and many of the buyers found in them hammered mill-stones of silver.   And, in Tolosa, the temple too was hallowed, since it was very much revered by the inhabitants of the surrounding country, and on this account the treasures there were excessive, for numerous people had dedicated them and no one dared to lay hands on them.''

''All above quotes:'' '''''[[Geographica]]''''' ([[Strabo]]), ''Book IV Chapter I''

The lakes at Tolosa were also briefly mentioned in Cicero's ''On the Nature of the Gods'' (Chapter 30), referencing political scandal in the late [[Roman Republic]]: "''Consider other judicial inquiries, the one in reference to the gold of Tolosa, and the one on the Jugurthine conspiracy...''".

'''''The Parnassus''''' is a [[fresco]] painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] in the [[Raphael Rooms]] ("''Stanze di Raffaello''"), in the [[Apostolic Palace|Palace of the Vatican]] in Rome, painted at the commission of [[Pope Julius II]].  It was probably the second wall of the ''[[Stanza della Segnatura]]'' to be painted between 1509 and 1511,&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Marcia B. Hall (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Raphael'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; after ''[[La Disputa]]'' and before ''[[The School of Athens]]'', which occupy other walls of the room.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, p. 74: "The execution of the ''School of Athens'' ... probably followed that of the ''Parnassus''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The whole room shows the four areas of [[human knowledge]]: philosophy, religion, poetry and law, with ''The Parnassus'' representing poetry. The fresco shows the [[mythology|mythological]] [[Mount Parnassus]] where [[Apollo]] dwells; he is in the centre playing an instrument (a contemporary [[lira da braccio]] rather than a classical [[lyre]]), surrounded by the [[muse|nine muses]], nine [[poet]]s from antiquity, and nine contemporary poets.  Apollo, along with [[Calliope]], the [[muse]] of epic poetry, inspired poets.&lt;ref name="Paoletti"&gt;{{cite book | title=Art in Renaissance Italy  | first1=J | last1=Paoletti | first2=G | last2=Radke| publisher=Laurence King Publishing | location=London | year=2005 | origyear=1997 | page=409 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFhVehAvVyUC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=56aATbfBK4assAOIt5iNBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false |isbn=1-85669-439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stinger"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Renaissance in Rome | author=Stinger, C | publisher=Indiana Bloomington Press | location=Bloomington, IN | year=1998 | origyear=1985 (hardback) | page=199 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uQYq9uMoOsC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yauATbaZFYf6sAOo7dGRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false | isbn=0-253-33491-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphael used the face of Laocoön from the classical sculpture ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', excavated in 1506 and also in the Vatican for his [[Homer]] (in dark blue robe to the left of centre), expressing blindness rather than pain.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Jones and [[Nicholas Penny]], ''Raphael'', p. 74, Yale, 1983, {{ISBN|0300030614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the female figures in the fresco have been said to be reminiscent of [[Michaelangelo]]'s ''Creation of Adam,'' [[Euterpe]] and [[Sappho]], who is named on a scroll she holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Drawings of Raphael: With a Complete Catalogue | author=Joannides, P | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA | year=1983 | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsV1ZASkP0kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yauATbaZFYf6sAOo7dGRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false | isbn=0-520-05087-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sappho is the only female poet shown, presumably identified so that she is not confused with a muse; she is a late addition who does not appear in the print by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] that records a drawing for the fresco.

The window below the fresco ''Parnassus'' frames the view of [[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]], believed to be sacred to [[Apollo]]. [[Renaissance humanism|Humanists]], such as [[Flavio Biondo|Biondo]], [[Maffeo Vegio|Vegio]], and Albertini, refer to the ancient-sun [[god]] of the [[vatican city|Vatican]].&lt;ref name="Stinger"/&gt;

'''The Welsh Group''' ({{lang-cy|Y Grŵp Cymreig}}) is an artists' collective, with the purpose of exhibiting and "giving a voice" to the visual arts in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=50+Years+of+the+Welsh+Group.+Peter+Wakelin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IF8vUcqiBoe50QWNxYDQCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA “50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The group began in 1948 as the South Wales Group, consisting of both professional and amateur artists.&lt;ref name="60 creative years"&gt;Karen Price, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/news/2008/11/21/art-group-marking-60-creative-years-91466-22306900/ "Art group marking 60 creative years"], WalesOnline, 21 November 2008. Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planet Mapping"&gt;David Moore, [http://www.planetmagazine.org.uk/html/newsite/onlinedetails/The_Welsh_Group.html Mapping the Welsh Group at Sixty: The Exhibition], Planet Online. Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=1513&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1386&amp;cHash=8e57b2d7d9bdf30aa36c37d7d06e3731&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"&gt;http://www.rcaconwy.org/content/uploads/documents/celf_issue7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The group's initial conception was a response to the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy's]] relatively weak representation from [[south Wales]] at that time.&lt;ref name="welshgroup-art.com"&gt;http://www.welshgroup-art.com/?page_id=10&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword to the South Wales Group’s first exhibition catalogue, David Bell wrote “It is the purpose of the Group to establish a new link between the artists of South Wales and their public".&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s the South Wales Group had begun exhibiting further afield in [[North Wales|north]] and [[mid Wales]] and into [[Bristol]] and [[Shrewsbury]]. The group adopted its current, broader title of The Welsh Group by 1975,&lt;ref name="50 years"/&gt; by which time it had also become a fully professional artists' group and, though its south east tendency is still an issue of some contention, the group had expanded its membership beyond south Wales&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; (including a number who are also members of the Royal Cambrian Academy and/or the splinter group initiated in 1956 when the South Wales Group failed to become a southern Academy; the [[56 Group Wales]]).&lt;ref name="50 years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt;

==21st century==
An exhibition curated and researched by Welsh Group member Dr Ceri Thomas and funded by [[The National Library of Wales]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], Contemporary Art Society for Wales&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casw.org.uk/english/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and the Welsh Group, was launched at the National Library of Wales, ([[Aberystwyth]]), before touring to the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy]], and [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum &amp; Art Gallery]]. The exhibition, ''Mapping The Welsh Group at 60'', included work by current and past members spanning a period from soon after the [[World War II|second world war]] to work completed in the twenty-first century, just after [[Government of Wales Act 1998|Welsh devolution]]. At the exhibition launch [[Welsh Government]] Heritage Minister at the time [[Alun Ffred Jones]] highlighted the group's importance: "The Welsh Group's 60th anniversary exhibition is a major event for the arts in Wales, bringing together work from talented Welsh artists old and new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id%3D1514%26no_cache%3D1%26tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D1455%26cHash%3D8449e65004bab1c67d28b5466ad80b22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706101457/http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=1514&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1455&amp;cHash=8449e65004bab1c67d28b5466ad80b22 |archivedate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fully illustrated colour book published by Diglot Books accompanied the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9780956086709}} (0956086705)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwales.com/goto/biblio/en/9780956086709/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
See [[:Category:Members of The Welsh Group]].

Full membership is made up of approximately 40 Welsh or Wales-based artists&lt;ref name="Planet Mapping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; including a chair (Dilys Jackson), secretary (David James) and treasurer (Heather Eastes). A list of current members can be found on the right-hand info. box.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denbighshire.gov.uk/en-gb/DNAP-8Q8LV5&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, with the deaths of a number of long lasting members, new members were elected, resulting in a greater gender balance and an increase in members from outside [[Cardiff]].
From 2007 until 2009 the group also included a young graduate member&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; and in 2012 artist Tiff Oben began a three-year Fellowship with the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://elbowroomintercourse.blogspot.co.uk/p/project-artists.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathew Prichard [[CBE]] is the group's president.&lt;ref name="welshgroup-art.com"/&gt;

'''''Time Bites: Views and Reviews''''' is a 2004 collection of [[essays]] by [[Doris Lessing]]. It contains book reviews, literary criticism and commentaries that have appeared in various works since the 1970s. 

==Reception==
[[BookList]] wrote "Most of her conversational, fast-moving, often wry inquiries into literature, politics, and ethics were originally published in England, hence little known in America, a lack redressed in this generous and pleasurable collection. Knowing books as intimately as she does, and caring deeply about reading and writing, Lessing pens critical essays that are vibrant and illuminating, with quotable lines on every page."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and the [[Library Journal]] stated "Lessing comments cleverly on the classic novelists (e.g., Leo Tolstoy), but some of the most interesting pieces are centered on less well known or virtually forgotten writers. There are quite a few essays on the Sufi author Idries Shah (1924-96); other topics Lessing covers range from politics to cats."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1640988/Reviews |title=Time bites : views and reviews |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote "While this collection of random journalism—some dating back to 1974, but most from the past decade—has the inevitable repetitions and a rather scattershot feel, it still gives a nice sense of Lessing’s character and commitments in vigorous old age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/doris-lessing/time-bites/ |title=TIME BITES Views and Reviews  |date=15 September 2005 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] wrote "The main theme, whether addressed overtly or underlying her literary criticism, is the indispensable place of books in the life of an educated person and an enlightened culture. Hers is a clarion call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-083140-0 |title=Time Bites: Views and Reviews |date=10 October 2005|website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Bites'' has also been reviewed by [[The New York Review of Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 30, 2006 |title=The Adventures of Doris Lessing|author=John Leonard |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2006/11/30/the-adventures-of-doris-lessing/ |journal=The New York Review of Books |publisher=NYREV, Inc|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Daily Telegraph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 October 2004 |title=A writer's life: Doris Lessing |author=Jasper Rees |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3625196/A-writers-life-Doris-Lessing.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Old Ones Eating Soup''''' (Spanish: '''''Dos viejos comiendo sopa''''') or '''''The Witchy Brew''''' (Spanish: '''''Dos Brujas''''')&lt;ref name="J84"&gt;Junquera, 84&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the fourteen ''[[Black Paintings]]'' created by [[Francisco Goya]] between 1819–1823. By this time, Goya was in his mid-70s and deeply disillusioned. He painted the works on the interior walls of the house known as the [[Quinta del Sordo]] ("House of the Deaf Man"). They were not intended for public display. ''Two Old Men Eating Soup'' likely occupied a position above the main door to the house, between ''[[La Leocadia]]'' and ''[[Two Old Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, G. "[http://www.theartwolf.com/goya_black_paintings.htm Goya: The Black Paintings]". theartwolf.com, August 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other ''Black Paintings'', it was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] in 1874–1878 under the supervision of [[Salvador Martínez Cubells]], a curator at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. The owner, [[Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger|Baron Émile d'Erlanger]], donated the canvases to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Prado.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image, two elderly figures loom forward from a black background; although they are assumed to be men, their gender is not readily apparent. The mouth of the left figure is drawn into a grimace, possibly from lack of teeth. In stark contrast to this animated expression, the face of the other figure hardly seems alive at all. Its eyes are black hollows and the head in general bears the aspect of a skull.

As in the rest of the ''Black Paintings'', Goya's use of his medium displays an assurance that comes only from a lifetime of experience. Paint is handled freely and rapidly yet with great decisiveness. The palette knife is also used to apply paint in some areas. Blacks, ochres, earth tones and grays are the only colors used, as in the rest of the black paintings.

The '''VroniPlag Wiki''' is a [[wiki]] started 28 March 2011 at [[Wikia]] that examines and documents the extent of [[plagiarism]] in German doctoral [[theses]].

== History ==
Following the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Doctorate plagiarism|revocation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg's doctoral degree]], the VroniPlag Wiki adopted the idea of the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Effect of Guttenplag|GuttenPlag Wiki]]. VroniPlag is named after the first thesis documented in it, the thesis submitted by Veronica Saß, daughter of German politician [[Edmund Stoiber]]. "Vroni" is a nickname in German for "Veronica".

== Modus operandi ==
Publication of a thesis consists of an overview that contains a "bar code" visualizing the amount of plagiarism, the exact bibliographic information of the theses (and if online, a link) and then a page overview that links to the fragments of plagiarism found on the page. Each fragment is classified as to the kind of plagiarism and must be verified by a second person before it is acceptable. Interesting parts are linked to separately and there is a final report published when the group feels the work is done.

[[File:Mm plag graphic.png|thumb|Visualization of the findings proved to be a key factor for the reception &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|title=GuttenPlag Wiki Grimme Online Award 2011|work=jury statement (in German)|accessdate=2012-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625105629/http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|archive-date=2011-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

VroniPlag Wiki only publishes text parallel documentation openly with names of the authors on theses that have been found to contain serious plagiarism. Before publication, the office of academic integrity at the university in question is formally notified, as any revocation of title must be done by the university.

In addition to looking at dissertations, the text parallels in one habilitation and one book how to write scientifically.

== Current cases ==
As of February 2016, 152 dissertations, 8 habilitations, 1 master's thesis, and 1 book on scientific writing have been examined in detail on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag overview|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven were:

Most of the plagiarism allegations made by VroniPlag led to investigations by the responsible universities, and some have resulted in the revocation of the [[Academic degree|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag Wiki – Overview of degree revocations|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these revocations have held up in court. However, some universities disagreed with VroniPlag finding, even in cases of blatant plagiarism (between 40 and 70% of pages affected with plagiarism). The correct methods for dealing with plagiarism—and its prevention—remains an ongoing discussion in Germany.
[[File:Zedler-Preis 2012-4718.jpg|thumb|Awarding of the "Zedler-Preis für freies Wissen 2012" by [[Wikimedia Germany]] on July 1, 2012]]

Prominent cases of plagiarism continue to surface in Germany. At the University of Münster, a text book on scientific writing for lawyers was found to contain massive plagiarism. Ironically, even the chapter on plagiarism was plagiarized. While the book told students not to use Wikipedia, the book itself contained 18 text fragments from the German Wikipedia. The dissertations of two of the book's authors, who received their doctorates at Münster University, were found to show extreme text parallels.

VroniPlag was the first [[Crowdsourcing|crowd sourcing]] phenomenon of its kind in Germany that has been referred to as an authoritative source in all major media channels in Germany. The plagiarism investigation project has triggered an extensive nationwide discussion about plagiarism and what represents appropriate consequences for plagiarists and universities. The project was awarded the Zedler Prize for Free Knowledge in the category External Knowledge Project of the year 2011 by the German Wikimedia on July 1, 2012.

Since September 2015, Minister of Defence [[Ursula von der Leyen]]'s thesis is under formal investigation by her university after the wiki alleged plagiarism on more than 40% of its pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula von der Leyen als Exempel?|url=http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/ursula-von-der-leyen-als-exempel-1.18625015|website=NZZ|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|250px|thumb|right|William Kempe (right) from ''Nine Days Wonder'' (1600)]]
'''William Kempe''' (died 1603), commonly referred to as '''Will Kemp''', was an English actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by [[William Shakespeare]]. Roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation, [[Falstaff]], and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great [[Jester|clown]] of the previous generation, [[Richard Tarlton]].

Kempe's success and influence was such that in December 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] alongside Shakespeare and [[Richard Burbage]], but in a short time (possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe) he parted company with the group. Despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career, he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603.

==Life==
In a 1615 lawsuit brought by Thomasina (née Heminges) Ostler, widow of [[William Ostler]], against her father, [[John Heminges]], the recently deceased actor William Kempe was referred to as a gentleman (''Willelmo Kempe nuper de Londonia generoso defuncto''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1909|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that he was a member of the Kempe family of [[Olantigh]], a property {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of [[Wye, Kent|Wye]] in [[Kent]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517–1591) did indeed have a son named William;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125–9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay) . Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story—dramatized in the play The Travailes of the Three English Brothers (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins—that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kempe first enters the historical record as a performer with [[Leicester's Men]] at [[Essex House (London)|Leicester House]] in May 1585&lt;ref&gt;The Earl made a special payment of ten [[shilling]]s for this performance.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in this service after [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Leicester]]'s departure for the [[Low Countries]] to take part in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Leicester's nephew, [[Philip Sidney]], sent letters home by way of a man he called "Will, my Lord of Lester's jesting player" and it is now generally accepted this was Kempe. Sidney complained in a letter to [[Francis Walsingham]] that "Will" had delivered the letters to [[Lettice Knollys|Lady Leicester]] rather than Sidney's wife, [[Frances Walsingham]]. After a brief return to England, Kempe accompanied two other future Lord Chamberlain's Men, [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] and [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], to [[Elsinore]] where he entertained [[Frederick II of Denmark]].

Kempe's whereabouts in the later 1580s are not known, but that his fame as a performer was growing during this period is indicated by [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''An Almond for a Parrot'' (1590). Nashe dedicated this work to Kempe, calling him "vicegerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the title-page of the [[book size|quarto]] of ''A Knack to Know a Knave'' advertises Kempe's "merriments". (Because title-pages were a means to draw attention to a book, the mention of Kempe suggests that he had become an attraction in his own right.) Critics have generally viewed the scene in which Kempe performs as rather flat (Collier, 97) and it is assumed that the scene provided a framework within which Kempe could [[improvise]]. Entries in the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Register]] indicate that three jigs (short comic plays) perhaps written by Kempe were published between 1591 and 1595. Two of these have survived.

By 1592 Kempe was one of [[Lord Strange's Men]], listed in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] authorisation for that troupe to play seven miles out of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although he had been a sharer in the plans to construct the [[Globe Theatre]], he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', in which there is no promised continued role for Falstaff, and ''[[Hamlet]]'', containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, (2005). ''1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare''. Faber and Faber, London. pp.42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hornback ''The English Clown Tradition from the Middle Ages to Shakespeare'' 1843843560 - 2013 "nd of the stupid puritan stereotype generally, that Shakespeare wrote his own strict, stupid puritan clown for Kemp — for whatever reason, Kemp's last Shakespearean role — in 1598. Like the “foolish Mayre or foolish justice” ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Kemp's Men, Chapelfield Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 167501.jpg|thumb|left| [[Wood carving]] of Kempe in Chapelfield Gardens, [[Norwich]]]]
After his departure from the Chamberlain's Men in early 1599, Kempe continued to pursue his career as a performer. In February and March 1600, he undertook what he would later call his "Nine Days Wonder", in which he [[morris dance]]d from London to [[Norwich]] (a distance of over a hundred miles) in a journey which took him nine days spread over several weeks, often amid cheering crowds. Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true.&lt;ref&gt;The year Kempe gives was 1599 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], which has caused some later confusion. That Kempe's jig took place in 1600 (New Style) is established by a record of the payment of his prize money by the Norwich City Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from [[Philip Henslowe]] and had joined [[Worcester's Men]]. The last undoubted mention of him occurs in Henslowe's diary in late 1602.

Parish records record the death of "Kempe, a man" in ''[[Southwark St Saviour|St. Saviour]]'', [[Southwark]], late in 1603. While this is not necessarily the comedian, the record fits his departure from the documentary record.

==Performance style==
In his time, Kempe was as famous for his [[Jig (theatre)|stage jig]]s as for his acting in regular drama. The jig, a kind of rustic cousin to [[commedia dell'arte]], featured as many as five performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of [[John Dowland]] (now in the [[Cambridge University Library]]). A famous 17th century jig called [[Kemp's Jig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathew Holmes lute books: Kemp's jig|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DD-00002-00011/194|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by [[Profile (Jan Akkerman album)|Jan Akkerman]] and [[Gryphon (album)|Gryphon]].

As an actor, Kempe is certainly associated with two roles: [[Dogberry]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Peter in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. (In the quarto text of the latter, and in both quarto and [[First Folio]] text of the former, he is identified in speech prefixes and stage directions.) From these hints, a list of Kempe's parts has been deduced which, if conjectural, is not improbable: Costard in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'', [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Lancelot Gobbo in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and Cob in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''. [[Falstaff]] is a more ambiguous case. Though Falstaff presents some features of an Elizabethan dramatic clown, his character is higher in class and more complex than the other roles with which Kempe is associated.

==In period fiction==
*Kempe appears as a character in ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return from Parnassus, or The Scourge of Simony]]'', possibly written during his lifetime or very shortly after his death. In it he praises Shakespeare for outdoing university-educated playwrights.

==In modern fiction==

===Film and TV===
*In the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]'' Kempe is portrayed by [[Derek Royle]] as an oafish alcoholic. He is ousted from the troupe and replaced by [[Robert Armin]] when they think he has betrayed their involvement in the [[Essex Rebellion]]. In fact Armin is the informer, who has framed Kempe to replace him.
*In the 1998 [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', he is played by veteran [[character actor]] [[Patrick Barlow]].
*In 2005's TV-film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' he is portrayed by [[John Voce]].
*In the 2007 [[Doctor Who]] episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", Kempe is played by [[David Westhead]].
*In the 2016 [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', Kempe is played by [[Spencer Jones (actor)|Spencer Jones]] as a parody of modern comedian [[Ricky Gervais]].

===Literature===
*Kempe is a key character in [[Kevin Sylvester]]'s 2015 novel for young adults ''Neil Flambé and the Bard's Banquet'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster Books
*Kempe appears in Ann Young's 2002 novel for young adults ''The Nine Days Wonder'', published by East Hall Press.
*In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 1991 graphic novel [[The Sandman: Dream Country]], Kempe is depicted in the issue ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a short story about Shakespeare's first performance of the play.
*Kempe also appears in ''[[King of Shadows]]'', a 1999 children's fiction book which shows Kempe as a clown dancing a Nine Days' Morris.
*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[alternate history]] 2002 novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' Kempe is one of the main characters. His off-stage personality is indistinguishable from the characters he plays on stage, and his antics provide much of the humour in the novel, which is set during a time of grim peril.
*In J. B. Cheaney's 2004 novel ''The True Prince'' along with more of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].
*''Kempe's Jig'' is referenced in [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s poem "After Reading ''Children of Albion'' (1969)" from his ''A Treatise of Civil Power'', published in 2007.

*Kempe was the title character in Dan Roentsch's play ''Will Kemp''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zuYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22dan+roentsch%22+%22will+kemp%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-qTsDS5Mt&amp;sig=14WNgEIw-OijU_2GKCyLscghp94&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FkidUa-NOaXY0gGC3ICQAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q="dan roentsch" "will kemp"&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] depicts Kempe as a moody tragedian in his 1968 play ''[[A Cry of Players]]'', a significant departure from Kempe's actual performance style.

In 2008, comedian [[Tim FitzHigham]] re-enacted Kemp's Nine Day's Wonder by Morris dancing from London to Norwich, forming the basis of his play The Bard's Fool, performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tim Fitzhigham The Bard's Fool | work=Chortle  | url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2008/t/16406/tim_fitzhigham%3A_the_bards_fool |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
