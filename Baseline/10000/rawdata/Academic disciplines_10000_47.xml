Polish art has often reflected European trends while maintaining its unique character. The [[Kraków]] school of Historicist painting developed by [[Jan Matejko]] produced monumental portrayals of customs and significant events in Polish history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15716">'''Attachment theory and psychology of religion''' research explores the ways that a belief in [[God]] can fulfill the criteria of an attachment figure and examines how individual differences in attachment lead to correspondence or compensation pathways.

==Introduction to attachment theory==
[[Attachment theory]] began with evolutionary psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in 1969.  Attachment theory was initially grounded in the observation that human beings appear to be born with an innate psychobiological system (the "attachment behavioral system") that motivates them to seek proximity to significant others (''attachment figures'').&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"&gt;Granqvist, P., Mikulincer, M. &amp; Shaver, P. R. (2010). Religion as attachment: Normative processes and individual differences. ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 14. doi: 10.1177/1088868309348618&lt;/ref&gt;  This revolutionary theory has found application in topics such as friendships, romantic relationships, coping with stress, loneliness and grief.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., (2005). Attachment, evolution, and the psychology of religion. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby described an attachment system as an evolved behavioral system in humans and other primates, which was designed by natural selection to maintain proximity between people and their attachment figures.  He postulated that the attachment system is in line with control systems theory, a goal-corrected, or homeostatic system.  The system monitors proximity to the primary caregiver, friends,&lt;ref&gt;ATTACHMENT AS A PREDICTOR OF FRIENDSHIP OUALITIES IN COLLEGE YOUTH by JOCELYN A. SAFERSTEIN, ''SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY'', 2005, 33(8), 767-776&lt;/ref&gt; pets,&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations, Sigal Zilcha-Manoor, ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; romantic partners and compares it to the desired level of proximity.  If the attachment figure is regarded as unavailable or not near enough, attachment behaviors are activated and deactivated when attachment figure becomes sufficient.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

On the “flip side” of attachment is the exploration system.  When the exploration system is activated, the attachment system is deactivated.  While the attachment system keeps the primary caregiver, adult romantic partner, pets or friends in close proximity, the exploration system allows for acquiring and practicing new skills while exploring the environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two functions are crucial in defining and distinguishing attachment relationships from other types of [[interpersonal relationships]].  Insecurely attached individuals either defensively minimize closeness seeking behaviors or maximize behaviors to become closer to attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two behaviors can be conceptualized as avoidant attachment (the extent to which a person distrusts attachment figure and strives to maintain behavioral independence and emotional distance) and anxious attachment (the degree to which a person worries that an attachment figure will not be available partly because the anxiously attached person doubts his or her own lovability and value).&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

==God as an attachment figure==
[[Psychoanalysis]] has a long history of conceptualizing religious belief in terms of relationship between the self and others.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;  A religious believer's perception that they have a relationship with a deity or God leaves open the question of whether such a relationship is an attachment relation. It is easy to draw analogies between beliefs about God and mental models of attachment figures, but it is a difficult distinction to make that God "really" can be an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;   In addition, research has shown that adult attachments and attachment to God are fundamentally distinct phenomenon, for instance Simon and Low (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010: Adult Attachment, God, Attachment and Gender in Relation to Perceived Stress by Sarah R. Reiner&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick suggests that for many people in many religions, the attachment system is fundamentally involved in their thinking, beliefs, and reasoning about God and their relationship to God.  According to this theory our knowledge of how attachment processes work in non-religious relationships should prove useful in understanding the ways in which people see God and interact with God.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Seeking and maintaining proximity to God===

One biological function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). ''Attachment and Loss'': Vol. 1. ''Attachment''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; is to maintain proximity between a person and an attachment figure.  Religions provide many ways that believers can maintain closeness to God.  Most theistic traditions describe God as being omnipresent, that is, is all places at all times, and while this is a key aspect of religion that creates closeness to God it is not the only way.  Virtually all religions have a place or building in which believers come to worship and be closer to their deity or God.  Within these places of worship, as well as outside of them, there is an array of idols and symbols; such as artwork, jewelry, and images of crosses that serve to remind believers of God’s closeness.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2008). Attachment and religious representations and behavior. In J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver, J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver (eds.), ''Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 906–933). New York, NY US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Granqvist and Kirkpatrick suggest that [[prayer]] is the most important way that believers maintain proximity to God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as haven of safety===

Another function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; is the attachment figure serving as a haven of safety in times of danger or threat. Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; also described three situations that activate the attachment behaviors: (1) frightening or alarming environmental events; (2)illness, injury or fatigue; and (3) separation or threat of separation from attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as secure base===

A “secure base” provides security for exploration in one’s environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; By most definitions God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient.  Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; described a secure base and its psychological effects as  this, “When an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence.”  It is easy to see how God would be the most secure of secure bases.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

In religious scripture God is often described as by one’s side, one’s rock and fortress, one’s strength, and many other terms that reflect an [[attachment theory|attachment relationship]].  Research done by Myers (1992), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; on the psychological outcomes associated with “attachment to God” (such as religious faith giving believers a sense of optimism and hope for the future) suggest that at least some forms of religiousness are associated with the kind of confident, self-assured approach to life that a secure base is thought to provide.

===Responses to separation and loss===

Ainsworth (1985), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; outlines the fourth and fifth defining criteria of attachment as concern responses to separation from, or loss of, the attachment figure per se: The threat of separation causes anxiety in the attached person, and loss of the attachment figure causes grief.  Because of God’s perceived omnipresence, it is difficult to determine whether God meets these criteria.  A believer does not lose a relationship with God as he or she loses a human relationship.  There are instances in religious life when believers are unable to experience God as they did at some point in their life.  It is important to note that in most Christian belief systems, separation from God is the very essence of hell.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Perceiving God as stronger and wiser===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; further described an “attachment relationship” as a weaker, less competent individual having another individual that he or she perceives as stronger and wiser, but this is now known to be wrong, as research has identified that  adult attachments include friendships, romantic relationships and even pets&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations by Sigal Zilcha-Mano, ''Journal of Research into Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reciprocal partner, be it human or non-human, is not necessarily perceived as stronger or wiser.

==Individual differences==

Individual differences in attachment security often affect the output of the attachment system in human relationships.  In the same way, they often modify the effects of attachment processes in the context of believers’ perceived relationships with God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  Two general hypotheses have been suggested and are seen as describing two distinct developmental pathways in religion—the compensation hypothesis and the correspondence hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Compensation pathway===

The compensation pathway is related to the regulation of distress following experiences with insensitive caregivers.  This situation describes a negative answer to the question of whether an attachment figure is sufficiently near, attentive, responsive, and approving.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  According to the [[attachment theory]] this situation activates attachment behaviors to restore an adequate degree of proximity, but under certain condition the individual may anticipate that their efforts are unlikely to be successful. Bowlby described what is likely to happen if such a case occurs, “Whenever the natural object of attachment behavior is unavailable, the behavior can become directed towards some substitute object.  Even though it is inanimate, such an object frequently appears capable of filling the role of an important, though subsidiary, attachment ‘figure.’  Like the principal attachment figure, the inanimate substitute is sought especially when a child is tired, ill or distressed”.&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

Granqvist and others&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt; suggest that people should also be able to turn to God as a substitute attachment-like figure under such conditions.  The compensation pathway’s focus is on the degree to which experiences with insensitive caregivers and/or attachment insecurities are associated with use of God and religion to regulate attachment-related distress.

Studies on attachment and religion have been ambiguous with no clear findings. 
According to Hall, Fukujima and Delaney after an independent review of literature: "On the surface, it appears that the empirical literature to date presents a rather inconsistent picture."&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"&gt;TODD W. HALL, Attachment to God and Implicit Spirituality, Clarifying Correspondence and Compensation Models, ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors in 2010 found that the compensation model was not supported, and insecure individuals high in parental insensitivity were not more religious.&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"/&gt;

Hagekull and Granqvist in 2001 found that childhood insecure attachment to a mother were strongly related to holding positive beliefs about astrology, the occult, parapsychology and UFOs in a Swedish sample.&lt;ref&gt;Personality and cognitive predictors of New Age practices and beliefs by Miguel Farias, Gordon Claridge and Mansur Lalljee, ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since these New Age beliefs, such as parapsychology or astrology are unrelated to a personal God, these results argue against the model that insecure individuals adopt concepts involving a personal loving God to compensate for inadequate childhood relationships.
 
Granqvist and Kirkpatrick&lt;ref name=G&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2004). Religious conversion and perceived childhood attachment: A meta-analysis. ''International Journal For The Psychology Of Religion'', 14(4), 223-250. doi:10.1207/s15327582ijpr1404_1&lt;/ref&gt; found that people who had sudden conversions to religion not only outscored non-converts in parental insensitivity but also outscored individuals who had experienced a more gradual increase in religiousness, however, the same authors have also found that people who suddenly deconverted from a religion, such as agnostics and atheists also scored higher in childhood insecure attachments to a mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;''Attachment, Evolution and the Psychology of Religion'' by Lee A. Kirkpatrick, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly to insecure parental attachment, insecure romantic attachment predicts sudden religious conversions and deconversions.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  

===Correspondence pathway===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; suggests attachment patterns continue across time partly because the way a person sees themselves and others ([[Attachment theory|internal working model]]) guides behavioral, emotional, and cognitive responses in social interactions over the life span.  The correspondence hypothesis suggests individual differences in religious beliefs and experience should correspond with individual differences in the internal working models and attachment patterns.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  This theory suggests a "secure" IWM of self and others predicts viewing God as supporting.  A person with a preoccupied or anxious attachment may be expected to have a deeply emotional, grasping relationship with God, while a person with an avoidant attachment would be expected to view God as remote or inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

The correspondence hypothesis suggests securely attached people would be expected to reflect the religious standards while insecurely attached people would not be expected to reflect their attachment figure’s religious standards.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"&gt;Granqvist, P. (2002). Attachment and religiosity in adolescence: Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 28(2), 260-270. doi:10.1177/0146167202282011&lt;/ref&gt;  People who report being more cared for by parents score higher on measures of religiousness, but only if their parents also displayed high levels of religiosity.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt; Another study found that such people had a higher assessed religiosity as socially rooted in the parental relationship.  This aspect of the correspondence hypothesis, that is, people reflecting attachment figure’s religious standards, can be called "[[Correspondence principle (sociology)|social correspondence]]".&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ([[STCW]]), requires that seafarers be provided with "familiarization training" and "'''basic safety training'''" which includes basic [[fire fighting]], elementary [[first aid]], personal [[survival techniques]], and personal safety and [[social responsibility]]. This training is intended to ensure that seafarers are aware of the hazards of working on a vessel and can respond appropriately in an emergency.

According to STCW, The STCW 95 Code requires that you take this 5-day course of instruction. This course has to be renewed every 5 years, or under certain conditions, you have to show that you have at least 1 year of service on board vessels of 200 grt or more within the last 5 years. The components generally includes a Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting (Basic Fire fighting) course of  2 days, a Personal Survival Techniques (PST) course of 1.5 days, a Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSR) course of  half a day, and, First Aid / CPR (Basic First Aid) course of  1 day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw-courses/basic-safety-training-bst Basic Safety Training Components]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biopunk''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[biotechnology]]" or "[[biology]]" and "[[punk subculture|punk]]") is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that focuses on biotechnology. It is derived from [[cyberpunk]], but focuses on the implications of biotechnology rather than [[information technology]].&lt;ref name="Quinion 1997"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Quinion, Michael| title = World Wide Words: Biopunk| year = 1997 | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-bio3.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopunk is concerned with [[synthetic biology]]. It is derived of cyberpunk involving [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hackers]], biotech [[mega-corporation]]s, and oppressive government agencies that [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|manipulate]] [[human DNA]]. Most often keeping with the dark atmosphere of cyberpunk, biopunk generally examines the dark side of [[genetic engineering]] and represents the low side of [[biotechnology]]. 
==Description==
[[Image:Ribofunk cover.gif|thumb|right|175px|Cover of ''Ribofunk'' by [[Paul Di Filippo]], a seminal biopunk story collection.]]

Biopunk is a subgenre of science fiction closely related to cyberpunk that focuses on the near-future (most often [[unintended consequences|unintended) consequences]] of the [[biotechnology revolution]] following the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]]. Biopunk stories explore the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of [[human subject research|human experimentation]], against a typically [[dystopian]] backdrop of [[totalitarian]] governments and megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control and [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]]. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on [[information technology]], but on [[synthetic biology]]. Like in [[postcyberpunk]] fiction, individuals are usually [[body modification|modified]] and [[human enhancement|enhanced]] not with [[cyberware]], but by [[human genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]].&lt;ref name="Quinion 1997"/&gt; A common feature of biopunk fiction is the "black clinic", which is a laboratory, clinic, or hospital that performs illegal, unregulated, or ethically-dubious biological modification and [[genetic engineering]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Pulver 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author = Pulver, David L. | title = GURPS Bio-Tech| publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-1-55634-336-0| authorlink= David L. Pulver| title-link = GURPS Bio-Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many features of biopunk fiction have their roots in [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', one of the first cyberpunk novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0006/biopunk.php|title=Fleshing Out the Maelstrom: Biopunk and the Violence of Information|author=Paul Taylor|publisher=Journal of Media and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the prominent writers in this field is [[Paul Di Filippo]], though he called his collection of such stories '''ribofunk''', a blend of "[[ribosome]]" and "[[funk]]".&lt;ref name="Fisher 1996"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Fisher, Jeffrey| title = Ribofunk| journal = Wired| year = 1996 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.11/ribopunk_pr.html| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''RIBOFUNK: The Manifesto'',&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 1998"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Di Filippo, Paul | title =  RIBOFUNK: The Manifesto | year = 1998 | url = http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPtext/Manifestos/Ribofunk.html | accessdate=2011-01-05 | authorlink = Paul Di Filippo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Filippo wrote:

{{quotation|Why Ribo?&lt;br/&gt;Cybernetics was a dead science when cyberpunk SF was born, a cul-de-sac without living practitioners. Furthermore, the "cyber" prefix has been irreparably debased by overuse, in vehicles ranging from comic books to bad movies. The tag now stands for nothing in the public mind but computer hacking and fanciful cyborgs such as Robocop. And Weiner's actual texts do not provide enough fruitful metaphors for constructing a systematic worldview.&lt;br/&gt;Why Funk?&lt;br/&gt;Punk was a dead music when cyberpunk SF was born, a cul-de-sac albeit with living practitioners who just hadn't gotten the message yet. The music's nihilistic, chiliastic worldview had already culminated in its only possible end: self-extinction.&lt;br/&gt;What is Ribofunk then?&lt;br/&gt;Ribofunk is speculative fiction which acknowledges, is informed by and illustrates the tenet that the next revolution--the only one that really matters--will be in the field of biology. To paraphrase Pope, ribofunk holds that: "The proper study of mankind is life." Forget physics and chemistry; they are only tools to probe living matter. Computers? Merely simulators and modelers for life. The cell is King!&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 1998"/&gt;}}

Di Filippo suggests that precursors of biopunk fiction include [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''; [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''[[The Tissue-Culture King]]''; some of [[David H. Keller]]'s stories, [[Damon Knight]]'s ''Natural State and Other Stories''; [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]]'s ''[[The Space Merchants|Gravy Planet]]''; novels of [[T. J.

'''Bookmarking''' (also "'''gene bookmarking'''" or "'''mitotic bookmarking'''") refers to a potential mechanism of transmission of gene expression programs through cell division.

During [[mitosis]], [[gene transcription]] is silenced and most [[transcription factors]] are removed from [[chromatin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 16188444| year = 2005| author1 = Sarge| first1 = K. D.| title = Gene bookmarking: Keeping the pages open| journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences| volume = 30| issue = 11| pages = 605–10| last2 = Park-Sarge| first2 = O. K.| doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 7553870| year = 1995| author1 = Martínez-Balbás| first1 = M. A.| title = Displacement of sequence-specific transcription factors from mitotic chromatin| journal = Cell| volume = 83| issue = 1| pages = 29–38| last2 = Dey| first2 = A| last3 = Rabindran| first3 = S. K.| last4 = Ozato| first4 = K| last5 = Wu| first5 = C| doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term bookmarking compares transcription to reading from a book. The pause in transcription during mitosis is like closing the book. "Molecular bookmarks" are the factors that allow transcription to resume in an orderly fashion in newborn cells following mitosis (when the book is re-opened).

Bookmarks fulfill the following criteria:

* at some point prior to the onset of [[mitosis]], the [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]] of genes that exist in a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]-competent state become "marked" in some way,
* this "mark" persists both during and after [[mitosis]], and
* the marking transmits gene expression memory by preventing the mitotic compaction of DNA at this locus, or by facilitating reassembly of transcription complexes on the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], or both.

==Bookmarking as selective maintenance of an open chromatin state==
The term bookmarking was originally coined to describe the non-compaction of some [[gene promoter]]s during [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 9619097| year = 1998| author1 = John| first1 = S| title = Bookmarking genes for activation in condensed mitotic chromosomes| journal = BioEssays| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 275–9| last2 = Workman| first2 = J.

A.| doi = 10.1101/gr.180646.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; While gene promoters tend to be better preserved than distal regulatory elements, substantial variation exists at individual sites.

==Bookmarking by DNA methylation, histone post-translation modification, and histone variants==
Some patterns of [[histone]] modification and the presence of some histone variants on DNA remain unchanged during mitosis and have the potential to act as bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23246430| year = 2013| author1 = Wang| first1 = F| title = Histone modifications and mitosis: Countermarks, landmarks, and bookmarks| journal = Trends in Cell Biology| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages = 175–84| last2 = Higgins| first2 = J.

A '''compression artifact''' (or '''artefact''') is a noticeable distortion of media (including [[image]]s, [[Sound recording|audio]], and [[video]]) caused by the application of [[lossy compression]].

Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the media's data so that it becomes simplified enough to be stored within the desired [[File size|disk space]] or be transmitted (or streamed) within the bandwidth limitations (known as a data rate or [[bit rate]] for media that is streamed). If the compressor could not reproduce enough data in the compressed version to reproduce the original, the result is a diminishing of quality, or introduction of artifacts. Alternatively, the compression [[algorithm]] may not be intelligent enough to discriminate between distortions of little subjective importance and those objectionable to the viewer.

Compression artifacts occur in many common media such as [[DVD]]s, common computer file formats such as [[JPEG]], [[MP3]], or [[MPEG]] files, and some alternatives to the compact disc, such as [[Sony|Sony's]] [[MiniDisc]] format. Uncompressed media (such as on [[Laserdisc]]s, [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CDs]], and [[WAV]] files) or [[lossless data compression|losslessly compressed]] media (such as [[FLAC]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) do not suffer from compression artifacts.

The minimization of perceivable artifacts is a key goal in implementing a lossy compression algorithm. However, artifacts are occasionally ''intentionally'' produced for artistic purposes, a style known as [[glitch art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geere |first=Duncan |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/17/glitch-art-databending |title=Glitch art created by 'databending' |publisher=Wired |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or datamoshing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker-Smith |first=Ben |url=http://bitsynthesis.com/2009/04/tutorial-datamoshing-the-beauty-of-glitch/ |title=Datamoshing&amp;nbsp;– The Beauty of Glitch |publisher=Bitsynthesis.com |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, a compression artifact is a particular class of data error that is usually the consequence of [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] in lossy data compression. Where [[transform coding]] is used, they typically assume the form of one of the [[basis function]]s of the coder's transform space.

Both frames were then zoomed by a factor of 4 (nearest neighbor interpolation).]]

When performing block-based coding for [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], as in JPEG-compressed images, several types of artefacts can appear.
* [[Ringing artifacts#JPEG|Ringing]]
* Contouring
* [[Posterizing]]
* Staircase noise ([[aliasing]]) along curving edges
* Blockiness in "busy" regions (block boundary artefacts, sometimes called macroblocking, quilting, or checkerboarding)

Other lossy algorithms, which use pattern matching to deduplicate similar symbols, are prone to introducing hard to detect errors in printed text. For example, the numbers "6" and "8" may get replaced. This has been observed to happen with [[JBIG2]] in certain photocopier machines.&lt;ref name="kriesel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning|title=Xerox scanners/photocopiers randomly alter numbers in scanned documents|date=2013-08-02|accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23588202 |title=Confused Xerox copiers rewrite documents, expert finds |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block boundary artefacts ===
[[File:The macroblocking effect (JPEG).png|344px|right|thumb|Block coding artefacts in a JPEG image. Flat blocks are caused by coarse quantization. Discontinuities at transform block boundaries are visible.]]
At low bit rates, any [[lossy]] block-based coding scheme introduces visible artefacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries. These boundaries can transform block boundaries, prediction block boundaries, or both, and may coincide with [[macroblock]] boundaries. The term ''macroblocking'' is commonly used regardless of the artefact's cause. Other names include tiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STFAx4jqU5IC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=tiling+mpeg&amp;source=web&amp;ots=orZJnUBtk5&amp;sig=IxPYZSsRy48ZxKbjYWe2LOUx3FE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result|title=The MPEG handbook by John Watkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; mosaicing, pixelating, quilting, and checkerboarding.

Block-artefacts are a result of the very principle of [[Transform coding#Digital|block transform]] coding. The transform (for example the discrete cosine transform) is applied to a block of pixels, and to achieve lossy compression, the transform coefficients of each block are [[Quantization (image processing)|quantized]]. The lower the bit rate, the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero. Statistically, images have more low-[[Spatial frequency|frequency]] than high-frequency content, so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization, which results in blurry, low-resolution blocks. In the most extreme case only the DC-coefficient, that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block, is retained, and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction.

Because this quantization process is applied individually in each block, neighboring blocks quantize coefficients differently. This leads to discontinuities at the block boundaries. These are most visible in flat areas, where there is little detail to mask the effect.

=== Image artifact reduction ===
{{Main article|Deblocking filter}}
Various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects, but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression (for instance, lower transmission and storage costs), many of these methods focus on "post-processing"—that is, processing images when received or viewed. No post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases; consequently, none has garnered widespread acceptance, though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems. Many photo editing programs, for instance, have proprietary JPEG artefact reduction algorithms built-in. Consumer equipment often calls this post-processing "MPEG Noise Reduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=blocking+artefacts&amp;i=56319,00.asp|title=PC Magazine, Definition of blocking artefacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video ==
[[File:Macroblocking error.png|thumb|350px|Example of image with artifacts due to a transmission error]]
When motion prediction is used, as in [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] or [[MPEG-4]], compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames, and move with the [[optic flow]] of the image, leading to a peculiar effect, part way between a painting effect and "grime" that moves with objects in the scene.

Data errors in the compressed bit-stream, possibly due to transmission errors, can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors, or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time, leading to "break-up" of the picture.  Where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream, decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval, creating a "ghost image" effect, until receiving the next independently compressed frame. In MPEG picture coding, these are known as "[[I-frame]]s", with the 'I' standing for "intra". Until the next I-frame arrives, the decoder can perform [[error concealment]].

=== Motion compensation block boundary artifacts ===
Block boundary discontinuities can occur at edges of [[motion compensation]] prediction blocks. In motion compensated video compression, the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks (macroblocks, partitions, or prediction units) of pixels from previously decoded frames. If two neighboring blocks use different motion vectors, there will be a discontinuity at the edge between the blocks.

=== Mosquito noise ===
Video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images, for instance [[Ringing artifacts#JPEG|ringing]] or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges, called '''mosquito noise''', as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object.&lt;ref name="dinhpatry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Le Dinh|first1=Phuc-Tue|last2=Patry|first2=Jacques|title=Video compression artifacts and MPEG noise reduction|url=http://www.embedded.com/print/4013028|website=Embedded|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'''3.9 mosquito noise:''' Form of edge busyness distortion sometimes associated with movement, characterized by moving artifacts and/or blotchy noise patterns superimposed over the objects (resembling a mosquito flying around a person's head and shoulders)."

=== Video artifact reduction ===
{{Main article|Deblocking filter}}
The artifacts at block boundaries can be reduced by applying a [[deblocking filter]]. As in still image coding, it is possible to apply a deblocking filter to the decoder output as post-processing.

In motion-predicted video coding with a closed prediction loop, the encoder uses the decoder output as the prediction reference from which future frames are predicted. To that end, the encoder conceptually integrates a decoder. If this "decoder" performs a deblocking, the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation, which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames. This is referred to as an in-loop deblocking filter. Standards which specify an in-loop deblocking filter include [[VC-1]], [[H.263]] Annex J, [[H.264/AVC]], and [[H.265/HEVC]].

== Audio ==
Lossy audio compression typically works with a psychoacoustic model—a model of human hearing perception. Lossy audio formats typically involve the use of a time/frequency domain transform, such as a [[modified discrete cosine transform]]. With the psychoacoustic model, masking effects such as frequency masking and temporal masking are exploited, so that sounds that should be imperceptible are not recorded. For example, in general, human beings are unable to perceive a quiet tone played simultaneously with a similar but louder tone. A lossy compression technique might identify this quiet tone and attempt to remove it. Also, quantization noise can be "hidden" where they would be masked by more prominent sounds. With low compression, a conservative psy-model is used with small block sizes.

When the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate, when the transform block size is restrained, or when aggressive compression is used, this may result in compression artifacts. Compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing, [[pre-echo]], "birdie artifacts", drop-outs, rattling, warbling, metallic ringing, an underwater feeling, hissing, or "graininess".

A good way to observe compression artifacts in audio is to listen to the applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file (e.g. 96 kbit/sec MP3). In general, musical tones have repeating waveforms and more predictable variations in volume, whereas applause is essentially random, therefore hard to compress. A highly compressed track of applause will illustrate the "metallic ringing" and other compression artifacts very well.

== Artistic use ==
[[File:Glitch video.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Video glitch art]]
Compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style, sometimes known as ''[[glitch art]]''.

In still images, an example is ''Jpegs'' by German photographer [[Thomas Ruff]], which uses intentional [[JPEG]] artifacts as the basis of the picture's style.&lt;ref&gt;''jpegs'', [[Thomas Ruff]], ''Aperture'', May 31, 2009, 132 pp., {{ISBN|978-1-59711-093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/2009/04/review_jpegs_by_thomas_ruff/ Review: jpegs by Thomas Ruff], by [[Jörg Colberg]], April 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[video art]], one technique is ''datamoshing'', where two videos are interleaved so intermediate frames are interpolated from two separate sources. Another technique involves simply transcoding from one lossy video format to another, which exploits the difference in how the separate video codecs process motion and color information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anoniem zei |url=http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.com/2009/02/from-compression-artifact-to-filter.html |title=From compression artifact to filter |publisher=Rosa-menkman.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was pioneered by artists [[Bertrand Planes]] in collaboration with [[Christian Jacquemin]] in 2006 with [[DivXPrime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jacquemin |first=Christian | title =Le bug dans l'oeuvre DivXPrime de Bertrand Planes: Invention et mutation.

In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''continental shelf pump''' is proposed to operate in the shallow waters of the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], acting as a mechanism to transport [[carbon]] (as either dissolved or particulate material) from surface waters to the interior of the adjacent deep ocean.&lt;ref name=tsun99&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-2-00010.x | last1 = Tsunogai | first1 = S. | last2 = Watanabe | first2 = S. | last3 = Sato | first3 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Is there a "continental shelf pump" for the absorption of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | url = | journal = Tellus, Ser.

==Overview==
Originally formulated by Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999),&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; the pump is believed to occur where the [[solubility pump|solubility]] and [[biological pump|biological]] pumps interact with a local [[hydrography]] that feeds dense water from the shelf floor into sub-surface (at least [[thermocline|subthermocline]]) waters in the neighbouring deep ocean.  Tsunogai ''et al.'''s (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; original work focused on the [[East China Sea]], and the observation that, averaged over the year, its surface waters represented a sink for [[carbon dioxide]].  This observation was combined with others of the distribution of dissolved [[carbonate]] and [[alkalinity]] and explained as follows :

* the shallowness of the continental shelf restricts [[convection]] of cooling water
* as a consequence, cooling is greater for continental shelf waters than for neighbouring open ocean waters
* this leads to the production of relatively cool and dense water on the shelf
* the cooler waters promote the [[solubility pump]] and lead to an increased storage of dissolved inorganic carbon
* this extra carbon storage is augmented by the increased biological production characteristic of shelves&lt;ref name=woll98&gt;Wollast, R. (1998). Evaluation and comparison of the global carbon cycle in the coastal zone and in the open ocean, p. 213-252. In K. H. Brink and A. R. Robinson (eds.), ''The Global Coastal Ocean''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the dense, carbon-rich shelf waters sink to the shelf floor and enter the sub-surface layer of the open ocean via [[isopycnal]] mixing

==Significance==
Based on their measurements of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux over the East China Sea (35 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; estimated that the continental shelf pump could be responsible for an air-to-sea flux of approximately 1 Gt C y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; over the world's shelf areas.

One caveat to this calculation is that the original work was concerned with the hydrography of the East China Sea, where cooling plays the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water, and that this mechanism may not apply in other regions.  However, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=yool01&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2000GB001359 | last1 = Yool | first1 = A. | last2 = Fasham | first2 = M. J.

For instance, in polar regions, the formation of [[sea ice|sea-ice]] results in the [[extrusion]] of salt that may increase seawater density.  Similarly, in tropical regions, [[evaporation]] may increase local salinity and seawater density.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14860">'''Countergradient variation''' is a type of [[phenotypic plasticity]] that occurs when the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variation determined by a biological population's [[genotype|genetic]] components opposes the phenotypic variation caused by an environmental gradient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conover|first=David|last2=Schultz|first2=Eric|year=1995|title=Phenotypic similarity and the evolutionary significance of countergradient variation|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=10|pages=248–252|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can cause different populations of the same organism to display similar phenotypes regardless of their underlying genetics and differences in their environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To illustrate a common example known as countergradient growth rate, consider two populations. The two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors, such as the temperature and available food. One population is genetically predisposed to have an increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that reduces growth rate, such as a cool environment, and thereby limits the opportunities to take full advantage of any genetic predisposition. The second population is genetically predisposed to have a decreased growth rate but inhabits an environment that supports an increased growth rate, such as a warm environment, and allows members of the population to grow faster despite their genetic disadvantage. Since the genetic influence directly counteracts the environmental influence in each population, both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate. Countergradient variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes, but it is still possible for the two populations to show phenotypic diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence.

Many examples of countergradient variation have been discovered through the use of [[transplant experiments]]. Countergradient variation of growth rate is one of the most common examples. Growth rate and body size have important ecological implications, such as how they impact an organism's survival, life history, and [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yampolsky|first=Lev Y.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Samuel M.|date=1996|title=Why Larger Offspring at Lower Temperatures? A Demographic Approach|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285841|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=147|issue=1|pages=86–100|doi=10.1086/285841|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countergradient variation has been described in many [[ectotherm]]ic animals, since ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic rates, and thus, their growth rates. Ectotherms grow at a slower rate as latitude increases due to this impact of temperature. However, under countergradient variation, when these same animals are placed in a common environment with their low-latitude relatives, they grow faster relative to the low-latitude population. These studies are useful in predicting how animals can adapt to and will survive in different environmental conditions.

==History==
[[File:Male Green Frog - Hunterdon County, NJ.jpg|thumb|Green frog ''[[Lithobates clamitans]]'' unexpectedly grows faster in montane populations]]
Countergradient variation, originally termed "contra-gradient variation", was coined by [[Richard Levins]] in his 1968 book ''Evolution in Changing Environments.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution in Changing Environments|last=Levins|first=Richard |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1968|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levins first used the term when describing patterns of body size across an altitudinal gradient in populations of ''Drosophila'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levins|first=Richard =|year=1969|title=Thermal Acclimation and Heat Resistance in Drosophila Species|jstor=2459410 |journal=The American Naturalist|volume=103|issue=933|pages=483–499|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then many other instances of countergradient variation have been discovered. A study by Keith Berven and others was the first to find countergradient variation in a vertebrate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berven|first=Keith A. |last2=Gill|first2=Douglas E.|last3=Smith-Gill|first3=Sandra J.|date=1979|year=|title=Countergradient Selection in the Green Frog, Rana clamitans |jstor=2407784|journal=Evolution |volume=33 |issue=2|pages=609–623 |doi=10.2307/2407784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they found that in comparing montane, high altitude, populations to lowland, low altitude populations of the green frog (''[[Lithobates clamitans]]'', formerly ''Rana clamitans''), rates of growth and development were higher in the montane populations. This is counter to what is expected since high altitude populations grow slower than low altitude ones in their respective environments. Similar to the results of this study, most of the known instances of countergradient variation are associated with a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient having an effect on growth rate (see Examples section).

==Mechanisms==
Countergradient variation is the opposite of [[cogradient variation]], in which the environmental effect on the phenotype enhances the genetic effect on the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One common way to test for both of these patterns is with [[transplant experiments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By bringing the two populations to the same environment, the environmental effect on phenotype is eliminated and only the genetic effect will cause variation. If cogradient variation is occurring, the same relationship will be seen in the common environment as the two natural environments. However, if countergradient variation is occurring the opposite relationship of what is seen in the natural environments will be seen in the common environment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arendt |first=Jeffrey D. |year=1997 |title=Adaptive Intrinsic Growth Rates: An Integration Across Taxa|jstor=3036336 |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=72|issue=2|pages=149–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if Population 1 has higher growth than Population 2 in their respective natural environments, countergradient variation can be detected if, when brought to the same environment, Population 1 now has lower growth than Population 2. Many of the examples listed above were discovered through these types of experiments. However, the mechanisms of how these differential growth rates arise is not fully understood.

Take the example of ''[[Eastern fence lizard|Sceloporus undulatus]],'' the eastern fence lizard. These lizards demonstrate countergradient variation in growth rate across a latitudinal gradient. That is, in a common environment eggs from populations from the northern part of their range hatch out sooner than the eggs from populations at a more southern range.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is opposite the pattern seen in their native habitats. One explanation for this could be that the northern eggs are also naturally larger, so they have more yolk energy available. Originally this maternal investment in larger eggs was thought to support increased developmental rate. However when yolk is removed from the eggs so that the populations have equal energy sources, there is still a substantial difference in growth.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Therefore, the mechanism behind this differential growth rate may lie in the efficiency of energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Storm |first=Melissa|last2=Angilletta|first2=Michael|year=2007|title=Rapid assimilation of yolk enhances growth and development of lizard embryos from a cold environment |url=http://angilletta.lab.asu.edu/Publications/Storm%20&amp;%20Angilletta%202007.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=210 |pages=3415–3421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological relevance==
Populations that inhabit high latitudes experience shorter growing seasons than those that inhabit low latitudes due to the differences in seasonality. Because of this, it is thought that countergradient variation of growth is a means to compensate for the short amount of time juveniles have to prepare for winter.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a genetic disposition to grow faster, these individuals can reach a large enough body size to survive through the winter. Increased body size is also associated with higher reproductive output.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, when countergradient variation acts on developmental rates, embryos that develop sooner or hatch out larger will have more time to grow or require less resources, respectively.

Since these inherently fast growth rates are not observed in all populations, it seems there are potential trade-offs that would prevent this from being beneficial in low latitude populations. One proposed detriment of enhanced embryonic growth is that animals use too much of their supplied nutrients or yolk during development. In some species of lizards the yolk remaining after hatching is absorbed into the body and used as energy for growth as a hatchling.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troyer|first=Katherine|date=1987|year=|title=Posthatching Yolk in a Lizard: Internalization and Contribution to Growth |jstor=1564470 |journal=Journal of Herpetology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=102–106|doi=10.2307/1564470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of more yolk energy during development diminishes the reserves available for hatchling growth and can impact hatchling survival.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinervo|first=Barry|date=1990|year=|title=The Evolution of Maternal Investment in Lizards: An Experimental and Comparative Analysis of Egg Size and Its Effects on Offspring Performance|jstor=2409407 |journal=Evolution |volume=44|issue=2 |pages=279–294|doi=10.2307/2409407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that animals that grow quickly do not expend as much energy on differentiation or cellular maintenance because they have shorter incubation times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This allows more energy to be used for growth, but less energy for differentiation. Increased growth has been shown to lead to higher occurrences of defects or complications that cause higher rates of mortality. Some examples include rapid growth leading to bone deformities in sandhill cranes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serafin|first=J. A.|date=1982-01-01|title=The Influence of Diet Composition upon Growth and Development of Sandhill Cranes|jstor=1367448|journal=The Condor|volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=427–434|doi=10.2307/1367448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased risk of cardiovascular problems in Atlantic salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=R. L.|last2=Farrell|first2=A. P.|last3=Knox|first3=D. E.|date=1992|title=Progression of Coronary Arterial Lesions in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) as a Function of Growth Rate|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f92-098|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=49 |issue=5|pages=878–884 |doi=10.1139/f92-098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals are able to employ different strategies for growth and development to counteract environmental challenges. However, the fact that all individuals do not grow faster and the presence of the mentioned potential fitness trade-offs show that there must be some limit to how much animals can use countergradient growth to compensate for environmental conditions that cause slow growth. Studies of countergradient variation are being explored as a useful way to predict the evolutionary constraints animals face in differing environmental conditions.

[[File:Henryk Siemiradzki 004.jpeg|thumb|300px|''An orgy in Imperial Rome'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]]]
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

The '''dominance-based rough set approach''' ('''DRSA''') is an extension of [[rough set|rough set theory]] for [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński.&lt;ref name="Greco_et_al_2001"&gt;

Kendall (eds.), Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques, Springer-Verlag , New York (2005) 475&amp;ndash;527&lt;/ref&gt; The main change compared to the classical [[rough sets]] is the substitution for the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation, which permits one to deal with inconsistencies typical to consideration of '''criteria'''  and '''preference-ordered decision classes'''.

==Multicriteria classification (sorting)==
'''[[Multicriteria classification]]''' ([[Multicriteria sorting|sorting]]) is one of the problems considered within [[MCDA]] and can be stated as follows: given a set of objects evaluated by a set of [[criterion (MCDA)|criteria]] (attributes with preference-order domains), assign these objects to some pre-defined and preference-ordered decision classes, such that each object is assigned to exactly one class. Due to the preference ordering, improvement of evaluations of an object on the criteria should not worsen its class assignment. The sorting problem is very similar to the problem of [[Statistical classification|classification]], however, in the latter, the objects are evaluated by regular attributes and the decision classes are not necessarily preference ordered. The problem of multicriteria classification is also referred to as [[ordinal classification problem with monotonicity constraints]] and often appears in real-life application when [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] and [[monotonic function|monotone]] properties follow from the domain knowledge about the problem.

As an illustrative example, consider the problem of evaluation in a high school. The director of the school wants to assign students (''objects'') to three classes: ''bad'', ''medium'' and ''good'' (notice that class ''good'' is preferred to ''medium'' and ''medium'' is preferred to ''bad''). Each student is described by three criteria: level in Physics, Mathematics and Literature, each taking one of three possible values ''bad'', ''medium'' and ''good''. Criteria are preference-ordered and improving the level from one of the subjects should not result in worse global evaluation (class).

As a more serious example, consider classification of bank clients, from the viewpoint of bankruptcy risk, into classes ''safe'' and ''risky''. This may involve such characteristics as "[[return on equity]] (ROE)", "[[return on investment]] (ROI)" and "[[return on sales]] (ROS)". The domains of these attributes are not simply ordered but involve a preference order since, from the viewpoint of bank managers, greater values of ROE, ROI or ROS are better for clients being analysed for bankruptcy risk . Thus, these attributes are criteria. Neglecting this information in [[knowledge discovery]] may lead to wrong conclusions.

==Data representation==

===Decision table===

In DRSA, data are often presented using a particular form of [[decision table]]. Formally, a DRSA decision table is a 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;S = \langle U, Q, V, f \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of objects, &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of criteria, &lt;math&gt;V=\bigcup {}_{q \in Q} V_q&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the domain of the criterion &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \colon U \times Q \to V&lt;/math&gt; is an ''information function'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(x,q) \in V_q&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;(x,q) \in U \times Q&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is divided into ''condition criteria'' (set &lt;math&gt;C \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;) and the ''decision criterion'' (''class'') &lt;math&gt;d\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Notice, that &lt;math&gt;f(x,q)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an evaluation of object &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on criterion &lt;math&gt;q \in C&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;f(x,d)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the class assignment (decision value) of the object. An example of decision table is shown in Table 1 below.

===Outranking relation===

It is assumed that the domain of a criterion &lt;math&gt;q \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is completely [[preorder]]ed by an '''[[outranking relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;\succeq_q&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is at least as good as (outranks) &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the criterion &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, we assume that the domain of &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of [[real number|reals]], &lt;math&gt;V_q \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outranking relation is a simple order between real numbers &lt;math&gt;\geq\,\!&lt;/math&gt; such that the following relation holds: &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y \iff f(x,q) \geq f(y,q)&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is straightforward for gain-type ("the more, the better") criterion, e.g. ''company profit''. For cost-type ("the less, the better") criterion, e.g. ''product price'', this relation can be satisfied by negating the values from &lt;math&gt;V_q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

===Decision classes and class unions===

Let &lt;math&gt;T = \{1,\ldots,n\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of decision criterion, &lt;math&gt;V_d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; consist of &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; elements (without loss of generality we assume &lt;math&gt;V_d = T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) and induces a partition of &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; classes &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Cl}=\{Cl_t, t \in T\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Cl_t = \{x \in U \colon f(x,d) = t\}&lt;/math&gt;. Each object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to one and only one class &lt;math&gt;Cl_t, t \in T&lt;/math&gt;. The classes are preference-ordered according to an increasing order of class indices, i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;r,s \in T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r \geq s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the objects from &lt;math&gt;Cl_r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are strictly preferred to the objects from &lt;math&gt;Cl_s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, we can consider the '''upward and downward unions of classes''', defined respectively, as:

:&lt;math&gt;
Cl^{\geq}_t = \bigcup_{s \geq t} Cl_s \qquad Cl^{\leq}_t= \bigcup_{s \leq t} Cl_s \qquad t \in T
&lt;/math&gt;

==Main concepts==

===Dominance===

We say that &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; '''dominates''' &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt; x D_p y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is better than &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on every criterion from &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y, \, \forall q \in P&lt;/math&gt;.  For each &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, the dominance relation &lt;math&gt;D_P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]], i.e. it is a [[preorder|partial pre-order]]. Given &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, let

:&lt;math&gt;
D_P^+(x) = \{y \in U \colon y D_p x \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
D_P^-(x) = \{y \in U \colon x D_p y \}
&lt;/math&gt;

represent '''''P''-dominating''' set and '''''P''-dominated''' set with respect to &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

===Rough approximations===

The key idea of the [[rough set]] philosophy is approximation of one knowledge by another knowledge. In DRSA, the knowledge being approximated is a collection of upward and downward unions of decision classes and the "granules of knowledge" used for approximation are ''P''-dominating and ''P''-dominated sets.

The '''''P''-lower''' and the '''''P''-upper approximation''' of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}, t \in T&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^+(x) \subseteq Cl_t^{\geq} \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^-(x) \cap Cl_t^{\geq} \neq \emptyset\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, the ''P''-lower and the ''P''-upper approximation of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}, t \in T&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^-(x) \subseteq Cl_t^{\leq} \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^+(x) \cap Cl_t^{\leq} \neq \emptyset\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Lower approximations group the objects which ''certainly'' belong to class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;). This certainty comes from the fact, that object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the lower approximation &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl^{\ge}_t)&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl^{\le}_t)&lt;/math&gt;), if no other object in &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; contradicts this claim, i.e. every object &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt; which ''P''-dominates &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, also belong to the class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;). Upper approximations group the objects which ''could belong'' to &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;), since object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the upper approximation &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl^{\ge}_t)&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl^{\le}_t)&lt;/math&gt;), if there exist another object &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt; ''P''-dominated by &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; from class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;).

The ''P''-lower and ''P''-upper approximations defined as above satisfy the following properties for all &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) \subseteq Cl_t^{\geq} \subseteq \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) \subseteq Cl_t^{\leq} \subseteq \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''''P''-boundaries''' (''P-doubtful regions'') of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
Bn_P(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})-\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Bn_P(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})-\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})
&lt;/math&gt;

===Quality of approximation and reducts===

The ratio

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_P(\textbf{Cl}) = \frac{\left|U - \left( \left( \bigcup_{t \in T} Bn_P(Cl_t^{\geq}) \right) \cup \left( \bigcup_{t \in T} Bn_P(Cl_t^{\leq}) \right) \right)\right|}{|U|}
&lt;/math&gt;

defines the '''quality of approximation''' of the partition &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Cl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into classes by means of the set of criteria &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This ratio express the relation between all the ''P''-correctly classified objects and all the objects in the table.

Every minimal subset &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_P(\mathbf{Cl}) = \gamma_C(\mathbf{Cl})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''[[reduct]]''' of &lt;math&gt;C\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;RED_{\mathbf{Cl}}(P)&lt;/math&gt;. A decision table may have more than one reduct. The intersection of all reducts is known as the ''core''.

==Decision rules==

On the basis of the approximations obtained by means of the dominance relations, it is possible to induce a generalized description of the preferential information contained in the decision table, in terms of '''[[decision rules]]'''. The decision rules are expressions of the form ''if'' [condition] ''then'' [consequent], that represent a form of dependency between condition criteria and decision criteria. Procedures for generating decision rules from a decision table use an inducive learning principle. We can distinguish three types of rules: certain, possible and approximate. Certain rules are generated from lower approximations of unions of classes; possible rules are generated from upper approximations of unions of classes and approximate rules are generated from boundary regions.

Certain rules has the following form:

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \geq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \geq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \geq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt;

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \leq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \leq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \leq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;

Possible rules has a similar syntax, however the ''consequent'' part of the rule has the form: &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''could belong to'' &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; or the form: &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''could belong to'' &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, approximate rules has the syntax:

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \geq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \geq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_k) \geq r_k\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_{k+1}) \leq r_{k+1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_{k+2}) \leq r_{k+2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \leq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_s \cup Cl_{s+1} \cup Cl_t&lt;/math&gt;

The certain, possible and approximate rules represent certain, possible and ambiguous knowledge extracted from the decision table.

Each decision rule should be minimal. Since a decision rule is an implication, by a minimal decision rule we understand such an implication that there is no other implication with an antecedent of at least the same weakness (in other words, rule using a subset of elementary conditions or/and weaker elementary conditions) and a consequent of at least the same strength (in other words, rule assigning objects to the same union or sub-union of classes).

A set of decision rules is ''complete'' if it is able to cover all objects from the decision table in such a way that consistent objects are re-classified to their original classes and inconsistent objects are classified to clusters of classes referring to this inconsistency. We call ''minimal'' each set of decision rules that is complete and non-redundant, i.e. exclusion of any rule from this set makes it non-complete.
One of three induction strategies can be adopted to obtain a set of decision rules:&lt;ref&gt;Stefanowski, J.: On rough set based approach to induction of decision rules. In Skowron, A., Polkowski, L. (eds.): Rough Set in Knowledge Discovering, Physica Verlag, Heidelberg (1998) 500--529&lt;/ref&gt;

* generation of a minimal description, i.e. a minimal set of rules,
* generation of an exhaustive description, i.e. all rules for a given data matrix,
* generation of a characteristic description, i.e. a set of rules covering relatively many objects each, however, all together not necessarily all objects from the decision table

The most popular rule induction algorithm for dominance-based rough set approach is DOMLEM,&lt;ref&gt;

Yao (eds.): Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence '''2005''' (2001) 304--313. Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; which generates minimal set of rules.

==Example==

Consider the following problem of high school students’ evaluations:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" border="1"
|+ Table 1: Example—High School Evaluations
! ''object'' (student) !! &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Mathematics)&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Physics)&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q_3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Literature)&lt;/small&gt; !! !! &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(global score)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;
|medium || medium || bad || || bad
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || medium || bad || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; 
|medium || good || bad || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt; 
|bad || medium || good || || bad
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_5&lt;/math&gt;

|good || medium || medium || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_9&lt;/math&gt; 
|medium || medium || good || || good
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_{10}&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || medium || good || || good
|}

Each object (student) is described by three criteria &lt;math&gt;q_1,q_2,q_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, related to the levels in Mathematics, Physics and Literature, respectively. According to the decision attribute, the students are divided into three preference-ordered classes: &lt;math&gt;Cl_1 = \{bad\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Cl_2 = \{medium\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 = \{good\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the following unions of classes were approximated:

* &lt;math&gt;Cl_1^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of (at most) bad students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of at most medium students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of at least medium students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of (at least) good students.

Notice that evaluations of objects &lt;math&gt;x_4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_6\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are inconsistent, because &lt;math&gt;x_4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has better evaluations on all three criteria than &lt;math&gt;x_6\,\!&lt;/math&gt; but worse global score.

Therefore, lower approximations of class unions consist of the following objects:

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_1^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_5\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_2^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_8\} = Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_2,x_3,x_7,x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_3^{\geq}) = \{x_7,x_9,x_{10}\} = Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, only classes &lt;math&gt;Cl_1^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be approximated precisely. Their upper approximations are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_1^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_4,x_5,x_6\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_2,x_3,x_4,x_6,x_7,x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;

while their boundary regions are:

:&lt;math&gt;Bn_P(Cl_1^{\leq}) = Bn_P(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_4,x_6\}&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, since &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; are approximated precisely, we have &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_2^{\leq})=Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_3^{\geq})=Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Bn_P(Cl_2^{\leq}) = Bn_P(Cl_3^{\geq}) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

The following minimal set of 10 rules can be induced from the decision table:

# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq bad&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq bad&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq good&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq good&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student = bad \lor medium&lt;/math&gt;

The last rule is approximate, while the rest are certain.

==Extensions==

===Multicriteria choice and ranking problems===

The other two problems considered within [[multi-criteria decision analysis]], [[multicriteria choice]] and [[ranking]] problems, can also be solved using dominance-based rough set approach. This is done by converting the decision table into [[pairwise comparison table]] (PCT).&lt;ref name="Greco_et_al_2001"/&gt;

===Variable-consistency DRSA===

The definitions of rough approximations are based on a strict application of the dominance principle. However, when defining non-ambiguous objects, it is reasonable to accept a limited proportion of negative examples, particularly for large decision tables. Such extended version of DRSA is called '''[[Variable-Consistency DRSA]] model (VC-DRSA)'''&lt;ref&gt;Greco, S., B. Matarazzo, R. Slowinski and J. Stefanowski: Variable consistency model of dominance-based rough set approach. In W.Ziarko, Y.Yao (eds.): Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence '''2005''' (2001) 170&amp;ndash;181. Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stochastic DRSA===

In real-life data, particularly for large datasets, the notions of rough approximations were found to be excessively restrictive. Therefore, an extension of DRSA, based on stochastic model ('''[[stochastic dominance-based rough sets|Stochastic DRSA]]'''), which allows inconsistencies to some degree, has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Dembczyński, K., Greco, S., Kotłowski, W., Słowiński, R.: Statistical model for rough set approach to multicriteria classification. In Kok, J.N., Koronacki, J., de Mantaras, R.L., Matwin, S.,
  Mladenic, D., Skowron, A. (eds.): Knowledge Discovery in Databases: PKDD 2007, Warsaw, Poland. Lecture Notes in Computer Science '''4702''' (2007) 164&amp;ndash;175.&lt;/ref&gt; Having stated the probabilistic model for ordinal classification problems with monotonicity constraints, the concepts of lower approximations are extended to the
stochastic case. The method is based on estimating the conditional probabilities using the nonparametric [[maximum likelihood]] method which leads
to the problem of [[isotonic regression]].

Stochastic dominance-based rough sets can also be regarded as a sort of variable-consistency model.

'''Earth Rangers''' is a Canadian environmental education and conservation non-profit aimed specifically at youth. The goal of the organization is to educate children and their families about [[biodiversity]], inspire them to adopt sustainable behaviours, and empower them to become directly involved in protecting animals and their habitats. Earth Rangers currently has more than 140,000 members across Canada, and visits 800 elementary schools every year with an educational live animal show.

==History==
Founded in 2004, Earth Rangers began as a local organization serving schools and community venues across the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. In 2011 the organization expanded across Canada, and since then has grown into a national organization of more than 40 staff and hundreds of volunteers.

== Membership ==
Earth Rangers is the largest conservation organization in Canada by membership, with more than 140,000 Earth Rangers Members in every province and territory.

Children can become an Earth Rangers Member by visiting the Earth Rangers website and registering for membership with parental permission. They are then sent a welcome package in the mail that includes their own personalized membership card, and gain access to online resources and environmentally-themed activities.

==Programs==

=== School Outreach ===
The Earth Rangers School Assembly is a presentation for Grades 1 to 6 that leverages the shared and innate connection children of all backgrounds have to animals. Through the power of live animal demonstrations, and positive, science-based information, the program educates students about the importance of protecting [[biodiversity]], while highlighting diverse [[Conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives across Canada. Throughout the show, students are introduced to four of the Earth Rangers Animal Ambassadors, such as Blue the [[Peregrine falcon|Peregrine Falcon]], Shelley the [[Painted turtle|Painted Turtle]], and Hudson the [[Eurasian lynx|Eurasian Lynx]]. The program visits more than 800 schools across Canada each year.

Earth Rangers also delivers hands-on, curriculum-linked Classroom Visits for Grades 3 to 6, which explore subjects like climate change, pollination, and wildlife habitats in more depth.

=== Bring Back the Wild ===
Each year, Earth Rangers works with conservation partners to identify Canadian species that are facing threats in the wild. The organization then develops tangible projects to protect those animals, ranging from conservation research, to land acquisition, to habitat stewardship. Earth Rangers Members are encouraged to select one of the animals and start a fundraising campaign to help them. Through the program, members learn about the full breadth and depth of conservation and are given the tools to make a meaningful contribution. Throughout the year, they are provided with updates on the project, ensuring that they know how their funds were used and what was accomplished with them and by them its was that they rescue animals.

=== Missions ===
Missions are fun, tangible activities Earth Rangers provides to members throughout the year that are designed to demonstrate the collective impact of working together to protect the environment. They address a wide range of issues and provide kids with ways to take action through things like conserving energy at home, organizing shoreline cleanups and planting pollinator gardens. Missions are also designed to be completed with the help of family and friends.The goal of this program is to educate and inspire children about biodiversity loss.

==Facility==
[[File:Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology.jpg|335px|thumb|Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology]]The Earth Rangers Centre is an advanced green building, certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum for Existing Buildings and Gold for New species.

The Earth Rangers Centre is located in [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]], [[Ontario]] on the grounds of the [[Kortright Centre|Kortright Centre for Conservation]]. It is home to Earth Rangers’ staff and Animal Ambassadors, and is a showcase of leading edge sustainable building technology including energy metering, smart automation and controls, innovative water and wastewater management, [[solar generation]], [[green roof]], [[geothermal heating]] and cooling.

=== Ventiliation ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first buildings in Canada to use [[displacement ventilation]], and has the largest installation of earth tubes in North America. This ventilation system circulates air through diffusers located near the floor level and displaces the existing air into return ducts near the ceiling.

=== Data Centre ===
The Earth Rangers 9.3 square metre [[data centre]] was completed in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell’s processing [[Server (computing)|servers]], and virtual personal machines using [[VMware]] View software. Nortel’s [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE) switching facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/commercial/technical-info/newsletter.cfm?attr=20 Heads Up Energy Efficiency Newsletter - March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen’s Green4Good program which works to combat the environmental impact of end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelbuzz.ca/2010/10/new-asset-reuse-program-couples-environmental-and-charitable-benefits-236/#more-236 New asset reuse program couples environmental and charitable benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Electricity ===
The Earth Rangers Centre has two [[Photovoltaic|solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays]] in operation; both convert the sun’s rays into standard voltage to be used by the building’s systems. In the Earth Rangers Centre parking lot there is a 57.6&amp;nbsp;kWp dual-axis tracking array on six separate posts consisting of 54 Solgate 175&amp;nbsp;W panels, provided by Sentinel Power Systems. Each array follows the sun from east to west during the day, increasing output by up to 30 per cent over a fixed panel. Each panel has its own {{Not a typo|Enphase}} micro-inverter, further increasing the efficiency of the arrays and allowing real-time monitoring of the system on panel by panel basis. The second array is located on the aviary, a building that boasts a 28.08&amp;nbsp;kWp, designed and installed by Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviro-energytech.com/ Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; This offsets approximately 10% of the Earth Rangers Centre’s annual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnyportal.com/Templates/PublicPageOverview.aspx?page=c9886868-f2c1-414d-adc6-ff66465e0935&amp;plant=d75990bd-510f-4560-9ebc-a3c5a35aaac9 Earth Rangers Aviary 28.08kW Earth Rangers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heating and Cooling ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first 100% radiant heated and cooled buildings in North America. The building uses 22&amp;nbsp;km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/[[glycol]]) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the [[glycol]] is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.

==Animal ambassadors==
The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 animals that act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, including ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African servals, and American kestrels.

{{Electrical Wiring Sidebar}}
In an electrical installation, an '''earthing system''' or '''grounding system''' connects specific parts of that installation with the Earth's conductive surface for safety and functional purposes.  The point of reference is the Earth's conductive surface. The choice of earthing system can affect the [[safety]] and [[electromagnetic compatibility]] of the installation. Regulations for earthing systems vary considerably among countries, though many follow the recommendations of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]. Regulations may identify special cases for earthing in mines, in patient care areas, or in hazardous areas of industrial plants. 

In addition to electric power systems, other systems may require grounding for safety or function.  Tall structures may have [[lightning rod]]s as part of a system to protect them from lightning strikes.  [[Electrical telegraph|Telegraph lines]] may use the Earth as one conductor of a circuit, saving the cost of installation of a return wire over a long circuit. [[Radio antenna]]s may require particular grounding for operation, as well as to control static electricity and provide lightning protection.

==Objectives of electrical earthing==

===Protective earthing===

An earth ground connection of the exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment helps protect from electric shock by keeping the exposed conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential, when a failure of electrical insulation occurs.  When a fault occurs, current flows from the power system to earth. The current may be high enough to operate the over current protection [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]], which will then interrupt the circuit. To ensure the voltage on exposed surfaces is not too high, the impedance (resistance) of the connection to earth must be kept low relative to the normal circuit impedance.  

An alternative to protective earthing of exposed surfaces is a design with "double insulation" or other precautions, such that a single failure or highly probable combination of failures cannot result in contact between live circuits and the surface.  For example, a hand-held power tool might have an extra system of electrical insulation between internal components and the case of the tool, so that even if the insulation for the motor or switch fails, the tool case is not energized.

===Functional earthing===
A ''functional earth'' connection serves a purpose other than electrical safety, and may carry current as part of normal operation.&lt;ref name="BS7671:2008. Part 2 - definitions"&gt;BS7671:2008. Part 2 – definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in a [[single-wire earth return]] power distribution system, the earth forms one conductor of the circuit and carries all the load current.  Other examples of devices that use functional earth connections include [[surge suppression|surge suppressors]] and [[electromagnetic interference]] filters.

==Low-voltage systems==
In [[low-voltage network]]s, which distribute the electric power to the widest class of end users, the main concern for design of earthing systems is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. The earthing system, in combination with protective devices such as fuses and residual current devices, must ultimately ensure that a person must not come into touch with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential exceeds a "safe" threshold, typically set at about 50&amp;nbsp;V.

On electricity networks with a system voltage of 240&amp;nbsp;V to 1.1&amp;nbsp;kV, which are mostly used in industrial / mining equipment / machines rather than publicly accessible networks, the earthing system design is as equally important from safety point of view as for domestic users.
 
In most developed countries, 220&amp;nbsp;V, 230&amp;nbsp;V, or 240&amp;nbsp;V sockets with earthed contacts were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120&amp;nbsp;V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally did not include a ground (earth) pin.  In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. 
 
For a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground.  Normal imbalances  in a [[split phase]] distribution system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages.  Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice.  For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.

If the fault path between accidentally energized objects and the supply connection has low impedance, the fault current will be so large that the circuit overcurrent protection device (fuse or circuit breaker) will open to clear the ground fault. Where the earthing system does not provide a low-impedance metallic conductor between equipment enclosures and supply return (such as in a TT separately earthed system), fault currents are smaller, and will not necessarily operate the overcurrent protection device. In such case a [[Residual-current device|residual current detector]] is installed to detect the current leaking to ground and interrupt the circuit.

===IEC terminology===
[[International standard]] [[IEC 60364]] distinguishes three families of earthing arrangements, using the two-letter codes '''TN''', '''TT''', and '''IT'''.

The first letter indicates the connection between [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer):

:'''"T"''' — Direct connection of a point with earth (Latin: Terra)
:'''"I"''' — No point is connected with earth (isolation), except perhaps via a high impedance.

The second letter indicates the connection between earth or network and the electrical device being supplied:

:'''"T"''' — Earth connection is by a local direct connection to earth (Latin: terra), usually via a ground rod.
:'''"N"''' — Earth connection is supplied by the electricity supply '''N'''etwork, either as a separate protective earth (PE) conductor or combined with the neutral (PEN) conductor.

====Types of TN networks====
In a '''TN''' earthing system, one of the points in the [[Electrical generator|generator]] or [[transformer]] is connected with earth, usually the star point in a three-phase system. The body of the electrical device is connected with earth via this earth connection at the transformer.
This arrangement is a current standard for residential and industrial electric systems particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cahier Technique Merlin Gerin n° 173 / p.9|http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/ECT173/&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor that connects the exposed metallic parts of the consumer's electrical installation is called
''protective earth'' (''PE''; see also: [[Ground (electricity)|Ground]]). The conductor that connects to the star point in a [[three-phase]] system, or that carries the return current in a [[single-phase]] system, is called ''neutral'' (''N''). Three variants of TN systems are distinguished:
;TN−S: PE and N are separate conductors that are connected together only near the power source.  
;TN−C: A combined PEN conductor fulfils the functions of both a PE and an N conductor. (on 230/400v systems normally only used for distribution networks)
;{{vanchor|TN−C−S}}: Part of the system uses a combined PEN conductor, which is at some point split up into separate PE and N lines. The combined PEN conductor typically occurs between the substation and the entry point into the building, and earth and neutral are separated in the service head.  In the UK, this system is also known as ''protective multiple earthing (PME)'', because of the practice of connecting the combined neutral-and-earth conductor via the shortest practicable route to a local Earth-Rod at the source and at each premises, to provide both System Earthing and Equipment Earthing at each of these locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/31741300/Industrial-Power-Systems-Handbook-Donald-Beeman Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpgAVE4UwFw&amp;t=1351s|title=Grounding - Safety Fundamentals (1hr:13min:19sec)|first=|last=MikeHoltNEC|date=14 November 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar systems in Australia and New Zealand are designated as ''multiple earthed neutral (MEN)'' and, in North America, as ''multi-grounded neutral (MGN)''.

|}

It is possible to have both TN-S and TN-C-S supplies taken from the same transformer. For example, the sheaths on some underground cables corrode and stop providing good earth connections, and so homes where high resistance "bad earths" are found may be converted to TN-C-S. This is only possible on a network when the neutral is suitably robust against failure, and conversion is not always possible. The PEN must be suitable reinforced against failure, as an open circuit PEN can impress full phase voltage on any exposed metal connected to the system earth downstream of the break. The alternative is to provide a local  earth and convert to TT.
The main attraction of a TN network is the low impedance earth path allows easy automatic disconnection (ADS) on a high current circuit in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit as the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults, and an RCD is not needed to detect earth faults.

====TT network====
In a '''TT''' (Terra-Terra) earthing system, the protective earth connection for the consumer is provided by a local earth electrode, (sometimes referred to as the Terra-Firma connection) and there is another independently installed at the generator. There is no 'earth wire' between the two.
The fault loop impedance is higher, and unless the electrode impedance is very low indeed, a TT installation should always have an RCD (GFCI) as its first isolator.

The big advantage of the TT earthing system is the reduced conducted interference from other users' connected equipment. TT has always been preferable for special applications like telecommunication sites that benefit from the interference-free earthing. Also, TT networks do not pose any serious risks in the case of a broken neutral. In addition, in locations where power is distributed overhead, earth conductors are not at risk of becoming live should any overhead distribution conductor be fractured by, say, a fallen tree or branch.

In pre-[[Residual-current device|RCD]] era, the TT earthing system was unattractive for general use because of the difficulty of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as [[Residual-current device|residual current devices]] mitigate this disadvantage, the TT earthing system has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where a low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.

The TT earthing system is used throughout Japan, with RCD units in most industrial settings.  This can impose added requirements on [[variable frequency drive]]s and [[switched-mode power supplies]] which often have substantial filters passing high frequency noise to the ground conductor.

====IT network====
In an '''IT''' network, the electrical distribution system has no connection to earth at all, or it has only a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] connection.

===Other terminologies===
While the national wiring regulations for buildings of many countries follow the [[IEC 60364]] terminology, in North America (United States and Canada), the term "equipment grounding conductor" refers to equipment grounds and ground wires on branch circuits, and "grounding electrode conductor" is used for conductors bonding an earth ground rod (or similar) to a service panel. "Grounded conductor" is the system "neutral".
Australian and New Zealand standards use a modified PME earthing system called Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN). The neutral is grounded (earthed) at each consumer service point thereby effectively bringing the neutral potential difference to zero along the whole length of LV lines.
In the UK and some Commonwealth countries, the term "PNE", meaning Phase-Neutral-Earth is used to indicate that three (or more for non-single-phase connections) conductors are used, i.e., PN-S.

===Resistance-earthed neutral (India)===
A resistance earth system is used for mining in India as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]]. Instead of a solid connection of neutral to earth,  a neutral grounding resistor ([[Electrical resistance and conductance#Neutral grounding resistance|NGR]]) is used to limit the current to ground to less than a750&amp;nbsp;mA. Due to  the fault current restriction it is more safe for gassy mines.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://as1.ori.nic.in/eicelectricity/ECNotification/Safety%20Regulation%20English.pdf]; Central Electricity Authority-(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply). Regulations, 2010; earthing system, rule 99 and protective devices, rule 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the earth leakage is restricted, leakage protection devices can be set to less than 750&amp;nbsp;mA . By comparison, in a  solidly earthed system, earth fault current can be as much as the available short-circuit current. 

The neutral earthing resistor is monitored to detect an interrupted ground connection and to shut off power if a fault is detected. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmea.net/Technical%20Papers/The%20Importance%20of%20the%20Neutral%20Grounding%20Resistor%20-%20Nov%2006.pdf], The Importance of the Neutral-Grounding Resistor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth leakage protection===
To avoid accidental shock, earth leakage relay/sensor are used at the source to isolate the power when leakage exceed certain limit. [[Earth leakage circuit breaker]]s are used for the purpose. Current sensing breaker are called RCB/ RCCB.  In industrial applications, earth leakage relays are used with separate core balanced current transformers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oOUuBAAAQBAJ]; Electrical Notes, Volume 1, By Sir Arthur Schuster, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; This protection works in the range of milli-Amps and can be set from 30&amp;nbsp;mA to 3000&amp;nbsp;mA.

===Earth connectivity check===
A separate pilot wire is run from distribution/ equipment supply system in addition to earth wire, to supervise the continuity of the wire.  This is used in the trailing cables of mining machinery.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-isbn=9781483102634|title= Electrical Engineer's Reference Book|first1= M A|last1= Laughton|first2= M G |last2=Say|publisher=Elsevier|date=2013|isbn=9781483102634|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p.32/18 mining--&gt; If the earth wire is broken, the pilot wire allows a sensing device at the source end to interrupt power to the machine. This type of circuit is a must for portable heavy electric equipment (like [[LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine)]]) being used in under ground mines.

===Properties===
====Cost====
* TN networks save the cost of a low-impedance earth connection at the site of each consumer. Such a connection (a buried metal structure) is required to provide ''protective earth'' in IT and TT systems.
* TN-C networks save the cost of an additional conductor needed for separate N and PE connections. However, to mitigate the risk of broken neutrals, special cable types and lots of connections to earth are needed.
* TT networks require proper [[residual current device|RCD]] (Ground fault interrupter) protection.

====Safety====
* In TN, an insulation fault is very likely to lead to a high short-circuit current that will trigger an overcurrent circuit-breaker or fuse and disconnect the L conductors. With TT systems, the earth fault loop impedance can be too high to do this, or too high to do it within the required time, so an RCD (formerly ELCB) is usually employed. Earlier TT installations may lack this important safety feature, allowing the CPC (Circuit Protective Conductor or PE) and perhaps associated metallic parts within reach of persons (exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts) to become energized for extended periods under fault conditions, which is a real danger.
* In TN-S and TT systems (and in TN-C-S beyond the point of the split), a residual-current device can be used for additional protection. In the absence of any insulation fault in the consumer device, the equation ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;L3&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 holds, and an RCD can disconnect the supply as soon as this sum reaches a threshold (typically 10&amp;nbsp;mA – 500&amp;nbsp;mA). An insulation fault between either L or N and PE will trigger an RCD with high probability.
* In IT and TN-C networks, residual current devices are far less likely to detect an insulation fault. In a TN-C system, they would also be very vulnerable to unwanted triggering from contact between earth conductors of circuits on different RCDs or with real ground, thus making their use impracticable. Also, RCDs usually isolate the neutral core. Since it is unsafe to do this in a TN-C system, RCDs on TN-C should be wired to only interrupt the line conductor.
* In single-ended single-phase systems where the Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and the part of TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), if there is a contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a ''neutral inversion''.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, B.G. (1936). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5308791%2F5317038%2F05317048.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5317048&amp;authDecision=-203 Neutral inversion in power systems]. In ''Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers'' '''78''' (471): 317–325.  Retrieved 2012-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of [[concentric cable]] construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building  sites, and in such cases it is  recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.
* In IT systems, a single insulation fault is unlikely to cause dangerous currents to flow through a human body in contact with earth, because no low-impedance circuit exists for such a current to flow. However, a first insulation fault can effectively turn an IT system into a TN system, and then a second insulation fault can lead to dangerous body currents. Worse, in a multi-phase system, if one of the line conductors made contact with earth, it would cause the other phase cores to rise to the phase-phase voltage relative to earth rather than the phase-neutral voltage. IT systems also experience larger transient overvoltages than other systems.
* In TN-C and TN-C-S systems, any connection between the combined neutral-and-earth core and the body of the earth could end up carrying significant current under normal conditions, and could carry even more under a broken neutral situation. Therefore, main equipotential bonding conductors must be sized with this in mind; use of TN-C-S is inadvisable in situations such as petrol stations, where there is a combination of lots of buried metalwork and explosive gases.

====Electromagnetic compatibility====
* In TN-S and TT systems, the consumer has a low-noise connection to earth, which does not suffer from the voltage that appears on the N conductor as a result of the return currents and the impedance of that conductor. This is of particular importance with some types of telecommunication and measurement equipment.
* In TT systems, each consumer has its own connection to earth, and will not notice any currents that may be caused by other consumers on a shared PE line.

===Regulations===
* In the United States [[National Electrical Code (US)|National Electrical Code]]  and [[Canadian Electrical Code]] the feed from the distribution transformer uses a combined neutral and grounding conductor, but within the structure separate neutral and protective earth conductors are used (TN-C-S). The neutral must be connected to earth only on the supply side of the customer's disconnecting switch.
* In [[Argentina]], [[France]] (TT) and [[Australia]] (TN-C-S), the customers must provide their own ground connections.
* Japan is governed by [[PSE law]], and uses TT earthing in most installations.
* In Australia, the Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN) earthing system is used and is described in Section 5 of AS 3000. For an LV customer, it is a TN-C system from the transformer in the street to the premises, (the neutral is earthed multiple times along this segment), and a TN-S system inside the installation, from the Main Switchboard downwards. Looked at as a whole, it is a TN-C-S system.
* In [[Denmark]] the high voltage regulation (Stærkstrømsbekendtgørelsen) and [[Malaysia]] the Electricity Ordinance 1994 states that all consumers must use TT earthing, though in rare cases TN-C-S may be allowed (used in the same manner as in the United States). Rules are different when it comes to larger companies.
* In [[India]] as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]], CEAR, 2010, rule 41, there is provision of  earthing,  neutral wire of a 3-phase, 4-wire system and the additional third wire of a 2- phase, 3-wire system. Earthing is to be done with two separate connections.  Grounding system also to have minimum two or more earth pits (electrode) such that proper grounding takes place. As per the rule 42, installation with  load above 5&amp;nbsp;kW exceeding 250&amp;nbsp;V shall have suitable Earth leakage protective device to isolate the load in case of earth fault or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://as1.ori.nic.in/eicelectricity/ECNotification/Safety%20Regulation%20English.pdf]; Central Electricity Authority-(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply). Regulations, 2010; rule 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application examples===
* In the areas of UK where underground power cabling is prevalent, the TN-S system is common.&lt;ref name="Linsley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Trevor Linsley|title=Basic Electrical Installation Work|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-42748-0|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]] LT supply is generally through TN-S system. Neutral is double grounded at distribution transformer. Neutral and earth run separately on distribution overhead line/cables. Separate conductor for overhead lines and armoring of cables are used for earth connection. Additional earth electrodes/pits are installed at user ends for strengthening earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Standard 3043 Code of practice for electrical wiring installations |url=http://www.bis.org.in/sf/etd/ETD20(10375)_21062016.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Most modern homes in Europe have a TN-C-S earthing system.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The combined neutral and earth occurs between the nearest transformer substation and the service cut out (the fuse before the meter). After this, separate earth and neutral cores are used in all the internal wiring.
* Older urban and suburban homes in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] tend to have TN-S supplies, with the earth connection delivered through the lead sheath of the underground lead-and-paper cable.
* Older homes in [[Norway]] uses the IT system while newer homes use TN-C-S.
* Some older homes, especially those built before the invention of residual-current circuit breakers and wired home area networks, use an in-house TN-C arrangement. This is no longer recommended practice.
* Laboratory rooms, medical facilities, construction sites, repair workshops, mobile electrical installations, and other environments that are supplied via [[Electrical generator#Engine-generator|engine-generator]]s where there is an increased risk of insulation faults, often use an IT earthing arrangement supplied from [[isolation transformer]]s. To mitigate the two-fault issues with IT systems, the isolation transformers should supply only a small number of loads each and should be protected with an [[insulation monitoring device]] (generally used only by medical, railway or military IT systems, because of cost).
* In remote areas, where the cost of an additional PE conductor outweighs the cost of a local earth connection, TT networks are commonly used in some countries, especially in older properties or in rural areas, where safety might otherwise be threatened by the fracture of an overhead PE conductor by, say, a fallen tree branch. TT supplies to individual properties are also seen in mostly TN-C-S systems where an individual property is considered unsuitable for TN-C-S supply.
* In [[Australia]], New Zealand and [[Israel]] the TN-C-S system is in use; however, the wiring rules state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth, via a dedicated Earth electrode. (Any metallic water pipes entering the consumer's premises must also be "bonded" to the Earthing point at the distribution panel.)  In Australia and New Zealand this is called the Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms.  In older installations, it is not uncommon to find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done.  The protective earth and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) – beyond this point, the protective earth and neutral conductors are separate.

==High-voltage systems==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
In high-voltage networks (above 1&amp;nbsp;kV), which are far less accessible to the general public, the focus of earthing system design is less on safety and more on reliability of supply, reliability of protection, and impact on the equipment in presence of a short circuit. Only the magnitude of phase-to-ground short circuits, which are the most common, is significantly affected with the choice of earthing system, as the current path is mostly closed through the earth. Three-phase HV/MV [[power transformer]]s, located in distribution [[electrical substation|substation]]s, are the most common source of supply for distribution networks, and type of grounding of their neutral determines the earthing system.

There are five types of neutral earthing:&lt;ref name=EEP1&gt;{{citation|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/types-of-neutral-earthing-in-power-distribution-part-1 |title=Types of neutral earthing in power distribution (part 1) |publisher=EEP – Electrical Engineering Portal |last=Parmar |first=Jignesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solid-earthed neutral
*Unearthed neutral
*Resistance-earthed neutral
**Low-resistance earthing
**High-resistance earthing
*Reactance-earthed neutral 
*Using [[earthing transformer]]s (such as the [[Zigzag transformer]])

===Solid-earthed neutral===
In ''solid'' or ''directly'' earthed neutral, transformer's star point is directly connected to the ground. In this solution, a low-impedance path is provided for the ground fault current to close and, as result, their magnitudes are comparable with three-phase fault currents.&lt;ref name=EEP1/&gt; Since the neutral remains at the potential close to the ground, voltages in unaffected phases remain at levels similar to the pre-fault ones; for that reason, this system is regularly used in [[high-voltage]] [[Electric power transmission|transmission networks]], where insulation costs are high.&lt;ref name=Guldbrand/&gt;

===Resistance-earthed neutral===
To limit short circuit earth fault an additional neutral earthing resistor (NER) is added between the neutral of transformer's star point and earth.

====Low-resistance earthing====
With low resistance fault current limit is relatively high. In [[India]] it is restricted for 50 A for open cast mines as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]], CEAR, 2010, rule 100.

====High-resistance earthing==== 
High resistance grounding system grounds the neutral through a resistance which limits the ground fault current to a value equal to or slightly greater than the capacitive charging current of that system

===Unearthed neutral===
In ''unearthed'', ''isolated'' or ''floating neutral'' system, as in the IT system, there is no direct connection of the star point (or any other point in the network) and the ground. As a result, ground fault currents have no path to be closed and thus have negligible magnitudes. However, in practice, the fault current will not be equal to zero: conductors in the circuit — particularly underground cables — have an inherent [[capacitance]] towards the earth, which provides a path of relatively high impedance.&lt;ref name=EPS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQJ_kzGapUC&amp;pg=PA488 |title=Electrical Power Systems: Theory and Practice |last=Bandyopadhyay |first=M. N. |chapter=21. Neutral earthing |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. |year=2006 |pages=488–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems with isolated neutral may continue operation and provide uninterrupted supply even in presence of a ground fault.&lt;ref name=EEP1/&gt; However, while the fault is present, the potential of other two phases relative to the ground reaches &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the normal operating voltage, creating additional stress for the [[Insulator (electrical)|insulation]]; insulation failures may inflict additional ground faults in the system, now with much higher currents.&lt;ref name=Guldbrand&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iea.lth.se/publications/Reports/LTH-IEA-7216.pdf |title=System earthing |publisher=Industrial Electrical Engineering and Automation, Lund University |year=2006 |last=Guldbrand |first=Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presence of uninterrupted ground fault may pose a significant safety risk: if the current exceeds 4&amp;nbsp;A – 5&amp;nbsp;A an [[electric arc]] develops, which may be sustained even after the fault is cleared.&lt;ref name=EPS/&gt; For that reason, they are chiefly limited to underground and submarine networks, and industrial applications, where the reliability need is high and probability of human contact relatively low. In urban distribution networks with multiple underground feeders, the capacitive current may reach several tens of amperes, posing significant risk for the equipment.

The benefit of low fault current and continued system operation thereafter is offset by inherent drawback that the fault location is hard to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Methods for detecting ground faults in medium-voltage distribution power systems |url=https://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2385 |last1=Fischer |first1=Normann |last2=Hou |first2=Daqing |publisher=Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. |page=15 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''economics of open data''' refers to the production, or loss, of wealth related to the use of [[open data]]. The cost of open data is a primary concern that can deter governments any companies from the opening up of data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The data revolution: big data, open data, data infrastructures &amp; their consequences|last=Kitchen|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open data may theoretically have a low production cost, the cost of creating the original data set as well as maintaining that data once it is produced can be expensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the creation of data may be expensive governments around the world such as France, the United States, and Japan, are anticipating substantial economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takagi|first=Soichiro|date=2014-12-11|title=Research Note: An Introduction to the Economic Analysis of Open Data|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|journal=The Review of Socionetwork Strategies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–128|doi=10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|issn=1867-3236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data vs. Paid Data ==
Open data has the capability to increase economic benefit through both individuals' and companies' use of the information. As of March 2016, it was estimated that open data was generating 0.5% more [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] compared to paid data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data|title=Research: The economic value of open versus paid data|last=The Open Data Institute|first=|date=|website=theodi.org|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of open data relies on either funding from government to create and maintain the data or funding in the form of grants and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Data made open by governments largely relies on the publication of [[public service]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Open-Data-for-Economic-Growth.pdf|title=OPEN DATA FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH|last=|first=|date=June 25, 2014|website=worldbank.org|publisher=Transport &amp; ICT Global Practice|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the data has already been created for a purpose, there is no creation cost for it to be made available to the public.

The opening of data requires current and advance technologies as well as the employment of users who are skilled enough to complete such work. When data is collected it cannot be presented to the public in its [[Raw data|raw]] form and may be inaccessible due to the program is uses or how the data is presented may be unusable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Time and funding is required to be reallocated by those who create the original dataset in order to make the data more accessible and usable for citizens to understand and engage with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When government is the main source of funding for the production of data it does not necessarily mean that they are the singular entity creating or managing the data. Governments sometimes contract out the creation or management of data to a third party. In some cases the third party may provide access to the data in exchange for a nominal fee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Citizen led initiatives face similar issues, such as the requirement of time and funding. For these types of initiatives it can be especially difficult because they do not have access to a guaranteed steady income such as taxpayer money; these organizations largely depend on donations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paying for the use of public data would cover some of the costs associated with creating, maintaining and formatting data, although it would reduced the economic value of what once was opened by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/309810679/Permission-granted-The-economic-value-of-data-assets-under-alternative-policy-regimes|title=The economic value of data assets under alternative policy regime: A Lateral Economics report for the Open Data Institute.|last=Open Data Institute|first=|date=March 2016|website=scribd.com|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for the data that is now available for free would result in a lack of innovation, decreasing the GDP, as well as an increase in the cost of services created from use of purchased data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The opening of data reduces costs associated with licensing that is usually associated with paid data, as it costs more money to license a dataset than to have no license at all,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are open datasets that use licensing as well. The opening of data itself does not simply create economic prosperity; systematic reforms would take place in order for open data innovations to find a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-3/generating-economic-value-through-open-data/|title=Generating Economic Value through Open Data|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data and Economic Opportunity ==
Open data gains additional economic value when governments support open data initiatives, although increased uptake and citizen engagement is vital to the economic success of open data. Greater economic impact depends on revenue growth, [[cost reduction]], and job creation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/opendata_pov_6feb.pdf|title=The Open Data Economy Unlocking Economic Value by Opening Government and Public Data|last=Cappgiemini Consulting|first=|date=2013|website=capgemini-consulting.com/|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue can be increased through the use of open data with the creation of new businesses, new good or services, or improved goods and services. When businesses profit from the creation of goods or services that rely upon open data not only does their company reap the financial benefits but the government does as well, through the increase of tax revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cost reduction helps to increase revenue for private sector businesses but is also an asset to government. Cost reduction in government, whether through reduction of services required or labor requirements, reduces government spending in some areas allowing for investment in others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open data can also increase economic benefit through the creation of jobs. Jobs can be created through innovative entrepreneurship or through the requirement of skilled labourers to use and understand data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples of Open Data Financial Models ==
There are numerous ways in which businesses currently support the generation, creation and upkeep of their data. In most cases businesses, or [[Information broker|data brokers]], will sell this information to third parties for a profit. As charging a fee for data would defeat the purpose of open data, governments and businesses must rely on different financial models. Normally a government or business would finance a public sector body to generate the data and profit or cost recovery would be achieved through users paying a licensing fee back to the public sector body. In turn, the profit made by the users could then be taxed and return finances to the government.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donker|first=Frederika Welle|last2=Loenen|first2=Bastiaan van|date=2016-07-28|title=Sustainable Business Models for Public Sector Open Data Providers|url=http://www.jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/view/390|journal=JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=28–61|issn=2075-9517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budget Financing Model ===
Budget financing a specific amount of funds is allocated toward the open data project from general revenue.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this case the funding invested in to the project is only expected to cover the minimal costs. Businesses and Governments often expect to see a return from the opening up of data such as increased efficiency within their work environment or more positive citizen perceptions of the company or government.

=== Community Model ===
This model relies on individual citizens to invest their time and skills into generating and maintaining open data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A very successful example of this would be [[OpenStreetMap]], which is continually updated and expanded by everyday users. The community model can also easily incorporate interactive benefits such as user feedback and the improvement of data quality. In this case there is a lot of room for innovation and conversation though the strong dependence on citizen engagement means individuals must actively be engaged with the data on a regular basis or risk the decrease in data quantity and quality.

=== Advertising Model ===
The advertising model is a popular method that can be seen across many online publications. In order to cover operating costs an open data publisher relies on revenue from advertisers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these cases citizens are exposed to add banners and pop ups displayed on the same site as the data they are attempting to access. While this may prove sustainable for individual company websites some governments have policies against displaying advertisements on government webpages, which could prevent them from adapting such a model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6686">'''Error concealment''' is a technique used in [[signal processing]] that aims to minimize the deterioration of signals caused by missing data, called [[packet loss]].&lt;ref name= "NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/antd/videosignalerror.cfm|title=Video Signal Error Concealment|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|date=March 29, 2011|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A signal is a message sent from a [[transmitter]] to a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] in multiple small packets. Packet loss occurs when these packets are misdirected, delayed, resequenced, or corrupted.&lt;ref name = "AV"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carle|first1=Georg|last2=Biersack|first2=Ernst|title=Survey of error recovery techniques for IP-based audio-visual multicast applications|journal=Network, IEEE|date=6 August 2002|volume=11|issue=6|pages=24–36|doi=10.1109/65.642357|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=642357&amp;isnumber=13911|accessdate=11 November 2014|issn=0890-8044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receiver-Based Techniques==

When error recovery occurs at the receiving end of the signal, it is receiver-based. These techniques focus on correcting corrupted or missing data.

===Waveform substitution===

Preliminary attempts at receiver-based error concealment involved packet repetition, replacing lost packets with copies of previously received packets. This function is computationally simple and is performed by a device on the receiver end called a "[[drop-out compensator]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/rdreport_1964_77.shtml|title=R&amp;D Report 1964-77 : Simple drop-out compensator for video tape recorders|author=W.K.E. Geddes|date=14 December 1964|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Networking"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurose|first1=James|last2=Ross|first2=Keith|title=Computer Networking: a Top-Down Approach|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|isbn=978-0-13-285620-1|page=640|edition=6th|url=http://www.pdfiles.com/pdf/files/English/Networking/Computer_Networking_A_Top-Down_Approach.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero Insertion===

When this technique is used, if a packet is lost, its entries are replaced with 0s.

===Interpolation===

Interpolation involves making educated guesses about the nature of a missing packet. For example, by following speech patterns in audio or [[Eigenface|faces]] in video.

===Buffer===

[[Data buffer]]s are used for temporarily storing data while waiting for delayed packets to arrive. They are common in internet browser loading bars and video applications, like YouTube.

==Transmitter-Based Techniques==

Rather than attempting to recover lost packets, other techniques involve anticipating data loss, manipulating the data prior to transmission.&lt;ref name="Networking" /&gt;

===Retransmission===

The simplest transmitter-based technique is retransmission, sending the message multiple times. Although this idea is simple, because of the extra time required to send multiple signals, this technique is incapable of supporting real-time applications.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;

===Packet Repetition===

Packet repetition, also called [[forward error correction]] (FEC), adds redundant data, which the receiver can use to recover lost packets. This minimizes loss, but increases the size of the packet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~nimrod/Compression/Video/v6err2003.pdf|title=Error Resilience and Concealment in Video Coding : With focus on H.261/3|author=Nimrod Peleg|date=January 2003|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolsky|first1=M|title=Simulation of FEC-based error control for packet audio on the Internet|journal=INFOCOM '98. Seventeenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. Proceedings.

===Interleaving===

[[Forward error correction#Interleaving|Interleaving]] involves scrambling the data before transmission. When a packet is lost, rather than losing an entire set of data, small portions of several sets will be gone.  At the receiving end, the message is then deinterleaved to reveal the original message with minimal loss.

'''Transmission without interleaving''':

 Original transmitted sentence:                      ThisIsNotAnExampleOfInterleaving
 Received sentence with a burst error:               ThisIsNot______pleOfInterleaving

The term "AnExample" ends up mostly unintelligible and difficult to correct.

'''With interleaving''':

 Transmitted sentence:                               ThisIsAnExampleOfInterleaving...
 Error-free transmission:                            TIEpfeaghsxlIrv.iAaenli.snmOten.
 Received sentence with a burst error:               TIEpfe______Irv.iAaenli.snmOten.
 Received sentence after deinterleaving:             T_isI_AnE_amp_eOfInterle_vin_...

No word is completely lost and the missing letters can be recovered with minimal guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forward error correction#Example]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Depending on the method of transmission (analog or digital), there are a variety of ways for errors to propagate in the message.

===Analog Applications===

Since its invention in the 1950s, the [[Magnetic tape|magnetic coating]] used in [[Video#Analog video|analog]] [[video tape]] has experienced [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] signal drop-outs.  Some of the techniques that were used for resolving these issues are analogous to those used for concealing errors in modern compressed video signals.

The process of [[click removal]] in [[audio restoration]] is another example of error concealment. A closely analogous example in the domain of image processing is the use of digital [[dust and scratch removal]] processing in [[film restoration]].

===Digital Applications===

Error concealment has many digital applications, including web browsing, video conferencing, Skype, and YouTube&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Google"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sat|first1=Batu|title=2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo|last2=Wah|first2=Benjamin|doi= 10.1109/ICME.2006.262681|pages=2153–2156|date=9–12 July 2006|chapter=Analysis and Evaluation of the Skype and Google-Talk Voip Systems|isbn=1-4244-0366-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">{{Antennas|components}}

In a radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], the '''feed line''' ('''feedline'''), or '''feeder''', is the cable or other [[transmission line]] that connects the antenna with the radio [[transmitter]] or [[Radio receiver|receiver]].   In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electric current|current]] from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as [[radio wave]]s.  In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver.  In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called [[transmission line]].    The most widely used types of feed line are [[coaxial cable]], [[twin-lead]], [[ladder line]], and at [[microwave]] frequencies, [[waveguide]].

Particularly with a transmitting antenna, the feed line is a critical component that must be adjusted to work correctly with the antenna and transmitter.  Each type of transmission line has a specific [[characteristic impedance]].  This must be matched to the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the antenna and the transmitter, to transfer power efficiently to the antenna.  If these impedances are not matched it can cause a condition called [[standing wave]]s on the feed line, in which the RF energy is reflected back toward the transmitter, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter.  This adjustment is done with a device called an [[antenna tuner]] in the transmitter, and sometimes a [[matching network]] at the antenna.  The degree of mismatch between the feedline and the antenna is measured by an instrument called an [[SWR meter]] (standing wave ratio meter), which measures the ''[[standing wave ratio]]'' (SWR) on the line.  

==Twin-lead==
{{Main|Twin-lead}}
Twin lead is used to connect [[FM radio]]s and [[television receiver]]s with their antennas, although it has been largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as [[amateur radio]] transmitters.  It consists of two wire [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] running parallel to each other with a precisely constant spacing, molded in [[polyethylene]] [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material in a flat ribbon-like cable.  The distance between the two wires is small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the RF signal carried on the wire.  Furthermore, the RF [[Electric current|current]] in one wire is equal in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and opposite in [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted).  Thus, if both wires [[Radiation|radiate]] energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies.  Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires at the same time and equally in magnitude and direction.  At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry.  Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out.  

Twin lead is considered a [[Balanced line]].

==Coaxial cable==
[[File:Antenne gp vhf 2.jpg|thumb|Coaxial cable feedline emerging from a VHF [[ground plane antenna]]. ]]
{{Main|Coaxial cable}}

Coaxial cable is probably the most widely used type of feedline, used for frequencies below the [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) range.    It consists of a wire center conductor and a braided or solid metallic "shield" conductor, usually [[copper]] or [[aluminum]] surrounding it.    The center conductor is separated from the  outer shield by a [[dielectric]], usually plastic foam, to keep the separation between the two conductors precisely constant.  The shield is covered with an outer plastic insulation jacket.  In ''hard coax'' cable, used for high power transmitting applications like [[television transmitter]]s, the shield is a rigid or flexible metal pipe containing a compressed gas such as [[nitrogen]], and the internal conductor is held centered with periodic plastic spacers.  It is a type of [[unbalanced line]], the shield conductor is usually connected to electrical [[ground (electricity)|ground]].  Coaxial cable's advantage is that the enclosing shield conductor isolates the cable from external electromagnetic fields, so it is very immune to interference.

==Waveguide==
[[File:Radar antenna feed waveguide.png|thumb|Complicated waveguide feed of a military radar]]
{{Main|Waveguide}}

[[Waveguide]] is used at [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) frequencies, at which other types of feedline have excessive power losses.  A waveguide is a hollow metallic conductor or pipe.  It can have a circular or square cross-section.  Waveguide runs are often pressurized with nitrogen gas to keep moisure out. The [[RF signal]] travels through the pipe similarly to the way sound travels in a tube. The metal walls keep it from radiating energy outwards and also prevent interference from entering the waveguide.  Because of the cost and maintenance waveguide entails, microwave antennas often have the output stage of the transmitter or the [[RF front end]] of the receiver located at the antenna, and the signal is fed to or from the rest of the transmitter or receiver at a lower frequency, using coaxial cable. 

A waveguide is considered an unbalanced [[transmission line]].

'''Five Towns College''' is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit]] college in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
Five Towns College was founded as a [[business school]] in 1972 by Lorraine Kleinman Cohen and Stanley G. Cohen, Ed.D. Programs at the college have expanded to cover popular music, theatre, film, and communications.

The original proposed site for this college was to be in [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]] in southwestern [[Nassau County, New York]], an area known as "The [[Five Towns]]", but the college was actually sited in [[Merrick, New York]]. Five Towns College moved to [[Seaford, New York]] in 1982 and to its current location in Dix Hills in [[Suffolk County, New York]] in 1992.

Although the college is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit college]], its board of trustees and its founding president Stanley Cohen have argued that the college would be "better positioned to build an endowment if it were a nonprofit." Cohen, however, was removed from office in 2014 and shareholders have filed suit against the plan to make the college non-profit.&lt;ref name=Newsday_2014_05_23&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/stanley-cohen-five-towns-college-founder-ousted-by-trustees-1.8167224 |title=Five Towns College founder removed by trustees |author= |publisher=[[Newsday]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College is the licensee of [[WFTU (AM)|WFTU]], 1570&amp;nbsp;kHz, in [[Riverhead, New York]] a full-time AM broadcast station, which returned to the air in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=18238 |title=Station Search Details |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Funding bias''', also known as '''sponsorship bias''', '''funding outcome bias''', '''funding publication bias''', and '''funding effect''', refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. Funding bias has been associated, in particular, with research into chemical toxicity, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krimsky Sheldon | authorlink = Sheldon Krimsky | year = 2013 | title = Do Financial Conflicts of Interest Bias Research? An Inquiry into the "Funding Effect" Hypothesis | url = http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/Funding%20Effect%20and%20Bias.PDF | journal = Science, Technology &amp; Human Values | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 566–587| doi = 10.1177/0162243912456271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instance of [[experimenter's bias]].

==Causes==

===Human nature===
The psychology text ''[[Influence: Science and Practice]]'' describes the act of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] as a trait in which a person feels obliged to return favors. This trait is embodied in all human cultures. [[Human nature]] may influence even the most ethical researchers to be affected by their sponsors, although they may genuinely deny it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cialdini, Robert B | title=Influence: Science and Practice (5th ed) |publisher=Prentice Hall |date=2008-08-08 |isbn=978-0-205-60999-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconduct===
{{main|scientific misconduct}}

[[Scientific malpractice]] involving shoddy research or data manipulation does occur in rare instances. Often, however, the quality of manufacturers' studies are at least as good as studies that were not funded by a special interest.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | author=David Michaels |title=It's Not the Answers That Are Biased, It's the Questions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071402145.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bias usually occurs for other reasons.

===Predetermined conclusion===

Research results can be selected or discarded to support a predetermined conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]], for example, would publish their own internal research that invariably found minimal adverse health effects of [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

A company that hires researchers to perform a study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor.&lt;ref name="lexchin"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Lexchin |last2=Bero |first2=Lisa A |first3=Benjamin |last3=Djulbegovic |first4=Otavio |last4=Clark |title=Pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome and quality: systematic review |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/326/7400/1167 |journal=BMJ |date=2003-05-31 |volume=326 |pmid=12775614 |issue=7400 |pages=1167–1170 |pmc=156458 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7400.1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[double-blind study]] with only objective measures is less likely to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.

===Publication bias===
{{main|publication bias}}

Scientist researcher [[Anders Sandberg]] writes that funding bias may be a form of [[publication bias]]. Because it is easier to publish positive results than inconclusive or no results, positive results may be correlated with being positive for the sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Anders Sandberg | authorlink=Anders Sandberg | title=Supping with the Devil | url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/supping_with_th.html | publisher=OvercomingBias |date=2007-01-14}}&lt;!-- This is a science blog written by a notable scientist; therefore it can be considered a reliable source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporting bias|Outcome reporting bias]] is related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple outcomes are measured but only the significant outcomes are reported, while insignificant or unfavorable outcomes are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Bias |url=http://www.chalmersresearch.com/bmg/types_bias.html |publisher=Cochrane Bias Methods Group |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of subjects or comparators===
{{main|selection bias}}
[[Selection bias]] may result in a non-representative population of test subjects in spite of best efforts to obtain a representative sample. Even a double-blind study may be subject to biased selection of dependent variables, population (via inclusion and exclusion criteria), sample size, statistical methods, or inappropriate comparators, any of which can bias the outcome of a study to favor a particular conclusion.&lt;ref name="lexchin" /&gt;

==Examples==
*A 1996 study on the effects of [[nicotine]] on [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive performance]] revealed that findings of nicotine or smoking improving performance were more likely to be published by scientists who acknowledged tobacco industry support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christina Turner |author2=George J Spilich |title=Research into smoking or nicotine and human cognitive performance: does the source of funding make a difference? |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119158100/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |journal=Addiction |year=1997 |volume=92 |issue=11 |pmid=9519485 |pages=1423–1426 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb02863.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2003 study of published research on antidepressants found that studies sponsored by manufacturers of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRI) and newer antidepressants tended to favor their products over alternatives when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Also, modelling studies funded by industry were more favorable to industry than studies funded by non-industry sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.183.6.498 |author=C. Bruce Baker |author2=Michael T. Johnsrud |author3=M. Lynn Crismon |author4=Robert A. Rosenheck |author5=Scott W. Woods |title=Quantitative analysis of sponsorship bias in economic studies of antidepressants |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/183/6/498 |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |year=2003 |volume=183 |pages=498–506 |pmid=14645020 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, studies funded by drug companies are four times more likely to favor the drug under trial than studies funded by other sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Becker-Brüser W |title=Research in the pharmaceutical industry cannot be objective |journal=Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes |year=2010 |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=183–9|pmid=20608245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2006 review of experimental studies examining the [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health effects of cell phone use]] found that studies funded exclusively by industry were least likely to report a statistically significant result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anke Huss |author2=Matthias Egger |author3=Kerstin Hug |author4=Karin Huwiler-Müntener |author5=Martin Röösli |title=Source of Funding and Results of Studies of Health Effects of Mobile Phone Use: Systematic Review of Experimental Studies |url=http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1289/ehp.9149 |date=2006-09-15 |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |pages=1–4 |volume=115 |issue=1 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9149 |pmid=17366811 |pmc=1797826}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) determined in 2008 that the [[Bisphenol A#September 2008|bisphenol A]] (BPA) in [[plastic container]]s is safe when leeched into food, citing chemical industry studies. Independent research studies reached different conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=vom Saal FS, Myers JP |title=Bisphenol A and Risk of Metabolic Disorders |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume= 300|issue=  11|pages= 1353–5|year=2008 |pmid= 18799451|doi=10.1001/jama.300.11.1353 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300.11.1353}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 90 percent of them finding health effects from low doses of BPA.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;
*Two opposing commercial sponsors can be at odds with the published findings of research they sponsor. A 2008 Duke University study on rats, funded by the [[Sugar Association]], found adverse effects of consuming the artificial sweetener [[Splenda]]. The manufacturer, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals LLC, responded by sponsoring its own team of experts to refute the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Splenda study: Industry and academia respond |author=Stephen Daniells |date=2009-09-25 |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Splenda-study-Industry-and-academia-respond |publisher=Foodnavigator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, an analysis of studies exploring health effects of sugary soda consumption published between 2001 and 2016 found a 100% probability that a study was funded by sugar-sweetened beverage companies if it found no link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and poorer metabolic health. Only 2.9% of studies that found sugary beverages linked to higher rates of diabetes and obesity were underwritten by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Schillinger D, Tran J, Mangurian C, Kearns C |title=Do Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Cause Obesity and Diabetes? Industry and the Manufacture of Scientific Controversy |url=http://annals.org/aim/article/2578450/do-sugar-sweetened-beverages-cause-obesity-diabetes-industry-manufacture-scientific |journal=Ann Intern Med |date=1 November 2016|doi=10.7326/L16-0534 |pmid=27802504 |volume=165 |pages=895–897}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[sugar marketing]]). The authors concluded "This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Melissa Healy |date=31 October 2016 |title=Does the soda industry manipulate research on sugary drinks' health effects? |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-sugary-drink-research-20161031-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2017 [[Cochrane review]] analysis of outcomes of studies pertaining to drugs and medical devices revealed that manufacturing company sponsorship "leads to more favorable results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundh|first=Andreas|last2=Lexchin|first2=Joel|last3=Mintzes|first3=Barbara|last4=Schroll|first4=Jeppe B.|last5=Bero|first5=Lisa|date=16 Feb 2017|title=Industry sponsorship and research outcome|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=MR000033|doi=10.1002/14651858.MR000033.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28207928|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Googlearchy''', or googlocracy, is a term associated with ways in which a [[search engine]], like [[Google]], can influence politics and social reality in general. More broadly, the term is intended to reflect on how certain technological developments can influence or dominate the organization of society. The scope of the term can have a variety of uses, such as the issues with [[freedom of the press]] and how modern politics are done through the use of the internet, with technologies such as Google. One issue raised when considering the ''googlearchy'' phenomenon in web politics is in considering whether the changes brought by technologies such as Google have reinforced the media that is already more powerful, or the other way around. This embodies itself in the hierarchy of an internet search, in which traditional media outlets and institutions are often at the top of the page, allowing little room for non-traditional or non-mainstream media. Resultantly, this creates a discourse of consensus politics, reinforcing social and political norms.

The '''Institute for Computer Science and Control''' of the '''[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]''' (in short '''MTA SZTAKI''', {{lang-hu|Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Számítástechnikai és Automatizálási Kutatóintézet}}) is a Hungarian [[research institute]], which was created in 1964.

== About the Institute ==

Its primary tasks include basic and application-oriented [[research]] in an interdisciplinary setting in the fields of [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]], [[intelligent systems engineering|intelligent systems]] as well as process control, [[multimedia]] and [[wide area network]]ing.

'''Iron-oxidizing bacteria''' are [[Chemotroph|chemotrophic]] [[bacteria]] that derive the [[energy]] they need to live and multiply by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] dissolved [[ferrous]] [[iron#Bioinorganic compounds|iron]]. They are known to grow and proliferate in waters containing iron concentrations as low as 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. However, at least 0.3 ppm of dissolved oxygen is needed to carry out oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Known species of bacteria with [[microbial metabolism]]s based on iron oxidation include ''[[Thiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]''.

==Habitat==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria colonize the transition zone where de-oxygenated water from an [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] environment flows into an aerobic environment.  Groundwater containing dissolved organic material may be de-oxygenated by [[microorganisms]] feeding on that dissolved organic material.  Where concentrations of organic material exceed the concentration of dissolved oxygen required for complete oxidation, microbial populations that contain [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|iron-reducing bacteria]] can reduce insoluble ferric oxide in [[aquifer]] [[soils]] to soluble ferrous hydroxide and use the oxygen released by that change to oxidize some of the remaining organic material:&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} pp.446-447&lt;/ref&gt;

::4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
::(water) + (Iron[III] oxide) → (Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen)

When the de-oxygenated water reaches a source of oxygen, iron-oxidizing bacteria use that oxygen to convert the soluble ferrous iron back into an insoluble reddish precipitate of ferric iron:&lt;ref&gt;Snoeyink, Vernon L. and Jenkins, David "Water Chemistry" John Wiley &amp; Sons (1980) {{ISBN|0-471-05196-9}} pp.380-381&lt;/ref&gt;

::4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
::(Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen) → (water) + (Iron[III] oxide)

Since the latter reaction is the normal equilibrium in our oxygen atmosphere while the first requires biological coupling with a simultaneous oxidation of carbon, organic material dissolved in water is often the underlying cause of iron-metabolizing bacteria populations.  Groundwater may be naturally de-oxygenated by decaying vegetation in [[swamp]]s; and useful mineral deposits of [[bog iron]] ore have formed where that groundwater has historically emerged to be exposed to atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.213&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthropogenic hazard|Anthropogenic]] sources like [[landfill]] [[leachate]], [[septic drain field]]s, or leakage of light [[petroleum]] fuels like [[gasoline]] are other possible sources of organic materials allowing soil [[microbes]] to de-oxygenate groundwater.

A similar reversible reaction may form black deposits of [[manganese dioxide]] from dissolved [[manganese]], but is less common because of the relative abundance of iron (5.4 percent) in comparison to manganese (0.1 percent) in average soils.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.544&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conditions associated with iron-oxidizing bacteria result from the anaerobic aqueous environment rather than the bacteria visibly colonizing that habitat.  [[Corrosion]] of pipes is another source of soluble iron for the first reaction above and the sulfurous smell of rot or decay results from enzymatic conversion of soil [[sulfate]]s to volatile [[hydrogen sulfide]] as an alternative source of oxygen in anaerobic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} p.459&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on water infrastructure ==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria can pose an issue for the management of [[water supply|water-supply]] [[water well|well]]s, as they can produce insoluble [[ferric oxide]], which appears as brown gelatinous slime that will stain plumbing fixtures, and clothing or utensils washed with the water carrying it. 

===Possible indicators===


[[Image:Iron bacteria burn.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Burn (landform)|burn]] in Scotland with iron-oxidizing bacteria.]]
The dramatic effects of iron bacteria are seen in surface waters as brown slimy masses on stream bottoms and lakeshores or as an oily sheen upon the water. More serious problems occur when bacteria build up in well systems.  Iron bacteria in wells do not cause health problems, but they can reduce well yields by clogging screens and pipes.

===Control===

Treatment techniques which may be successful in removing or reducing iron bacteria include physical removal, pasteurization, and chemical treatment. Treatment of heavily infected wells may be difficult, expensive, and only partially successful.

Physical removal is typically done as a first step. Small diameter pipes are sometimes cleaned with a wire brush, while larger lines can be scrubbed and flushed clean with a [[Drain cleaner#Sewer jetters|sewer jetter]]. The pumping equipment in the well must also be removed and cleaned. 

Iron filters have been used to treat iron bacteria. Iron filters are similar in appearance and size to conventional water softeners but contain beds of media which have mild oxidizing power. As the iron-bearing water is passed through the bed, any soluble ferrous iron is converted to the insoluble ferric state and then filtered from the water. Any previously precipitated iron is removed by simple mechanical filtration. Several different filter media may be used in these iron filters, including manganese greensand, Birm, MTM, multi-media, sand, and other synthetic materials. In most cases, the higher oxides of manganese produce the desired oxidizing action. Iron filters do have limitations. Since the oxidizing action is relatively mild, it will not work well when organic matter, either combined with the iron or completely separate, is present in the water and iron bacteria will not be killed. Extremely high iron concentrations may require inconvenient frequent backwashing and/or regeneration. Finally, iron filter media requires high flow rates for proper backwashing and such water flows are not always available.

Wildfires may release iron-containing compounds from the soil into small wildland streams and cause a rapid but usually temporary proliferation of iron-oxidizing bacteria complete with orange coloration, the gelatinous mats, and sulphurous odors. Higher quality personal filters typically used in backpacking/trekking can successfully remove bacteria, odor, and restore water clarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15591">'''Kim Timby''' (born 1970 in California, United States) is a [[History of photography|photography historian]] based in Paris who teaches at the [[École du Louvre]] and works as a curator for a private collection specialising international nineteenth-century photography. From her research and teaching, Timby writes on the cultural history of photography as a technology.

== Education ==
Timby’s research draws on her learning, and combines her interests, in [[anthropology]], history and photography. Her early experience of the medium was through her maternal grandmother, who had a darkroom and was active in her local photo club and showed her how to print in the darkroom. Her first camera was a high school graduation gift.

Timby was educated at the private [[Connecticut College]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], where as an Anthropology undergraduate she undertook a minor subject studio arts, studying photography and making photographs in the vintage processes of [[cyanotype]] and [[gum printing]]. From there she  graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] in 1992 before completing an M.A. in that discipline in 1996 at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], [[France]], and from 2002–2006 undertook her PhD at the same [[Paris]] institution.

== Career ==
Timby’s Master's thesis was "La photographie et l'ethnologie de la France. Modes d'emploi et apports de l'image" (‘Photography and the ethnology of France. Uses and contributions of the image’) dealing with the usefulness of photography to museums of French [[ethnography]] and how photography was employed by anthropologists in their [[Field research|field work]] and publications in studying French culture or as object of study in its own right. This research shifted her interest from traditional anthropology toward history, taking her into the [[history of photography]], where her anthropology guides her consideration of its cultural impact.

Timby’s research subsequent to her master's degree and her interest in photographic technologies and their social utility and impact stem also from her work as a [[curator]]. From 1996 to 2001 she was employed in that role at the [[Carnavalet Museum|Musée Carnavalet]], the museum of the history of Paris, a city so closely associated with the progress of photography from its invention.

There she prepared exhibitions including "Paris in 3D: from Stereoscopy to Virtual Reality, 1850-2000”, an exercise in configuring rigorous academic archival research for general consumption.

Timby had first become interested in [[Stereoscopy|stereography]] when working with the photography historian [[Peter E. Palmquist|Peter Palmquist]] for a month in the early 1990s as an undergraduate in the US. His study of original photographs and primary source materials to uncover overlooked aspects of the history of photography chimed with her background in anthropology and as an historian. Palmquist took her to an antique shop in [[Arcata, California|Arcata]] (California) where he lived, and there she bought her first stereo view.

Timby was able to find temporary work that engaged her interest in photography and anthropology at the [[Musée de l'Homme|Musée de l’Homme]] photography department and Musée Carnavalet specialising in the history of Paris. In 1996 she began co-curating a 3D exhibition at the Carnavalet museum, and the resultant display opened in Paris in October 2000 and closed January 2001. The exhibition and catalogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Reynaud, Francoise | author2=Tambrun, Catherine | author3=Timby, Kim | author4=Musıe Carnavalet | title=Paris in 3D : from stereoscope to virtual reality, 1850-2000 | publication-date=2000 | publisher=Booth Clibborn Editions | isbn=978-1-86154-162-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in English and in French ( “Paris en 3D: de la stéréoscopie à la réalité virtuelle, 1850-2000”) in hardbound editions, appealed to a diverse audience who, using the different stereo viewers enclosed in the book, could enjoy hundreds of images, stereo pairs, [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyphs]], [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] images and [[Holography|holograms]], of Parisian life from the early nineteenth century to the present. Timby contributed text that one reviewer&lt;ref&gt;Rulien, Diane E. "Paris in 3D: From the Stereoscope to Virtual Reality 1850-2000." PSA Journal, vol. 67, no. 3, 2001, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  called an ‘historical roadmap of the techniques leading to the development of 3D photography from stereocards, anaglyphs, and holograms to 3D computer imagery and [[virtual reality]]’. The book and exhibition were of ‘landmark’ historical value, in the opinion of another reviewer,&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen, Curator and Department Head of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department, Prints and Drawings Department, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’, in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world. Columbus, Ohio. March/April 2016. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; with many of its pictures showing antique equipment and portraits of pioneers of stereoscopy and integrated biographical information and excerpts of treatises of prominent persons in stereoscopy. In the opinion of David Haberstich, the exhibition was ‘definitive’ in dealing with perception, art, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;“There will be other exhibitions dealing with stereoscopy and virtual reality, given the importance of the subject, but it is difficult to imagine anything similarly definitive and of comparable diversity and magnitude. If the exhibition 'Paris en 3D' was essentially about perception, art, and technology, rather than about documenting the history of a city, nevertheless its concentration on Paris provided a unique and rational focus. The catalogue serves as a permanent surrogate and constitutes a landmark study in this specialized area of the history of photography, with profound implications for future discourse about photographic vision.” David Haberstich (2001) in Book Reviews, History of Photography, 25:4, 392-396, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2001.10443243&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with a training and research grant from the Ministry of Culture and Communication (photographic patrimony) for access to patents, and by the Carnavalet museum as part of her work on the exhibition "Paris in 3D: de stereoscopy to virtual reality, 1850-2000 ", Timby published a 23-page academic paper on research into commercial, advertising, entertainment, and even medical and religious, applications of the lenticular image invention in France, and its technical development.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby, ‘Images en relief et images changeantes. La photographie à réseau ligné’, Études photographiques, no. 9, May 2001, p. 124-147&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation into 3D and colour photography ==
When researching 3D imaging Timby found that [[Color photography|colour]] was a major consideration, a thread that developed during her PhD on lenticular photography, begun after "Paris in 3D" closed and she had left Carnavalet. Her first published work on colour was the 2005 article "Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories," from she developed the idea that colour, like 3D, was a constructed illusion; an ambition in common of the two technologies was the reproduction of an aspect of [[Perception|human perception]] through its [[deconstruction]] and reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby. ‘Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories’, History of Photography, vol. 29, n" 2. Summer 2005, p. 183-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, before the completion in 2006 of her PhD at the Paris École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Timby was appointed Director of Collections at the Musée [[Nicéphore Niépce]] in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], France which houses the archive of devices and objects once belonging to the inventor of photography as well as nearly three million images from all photographic processes.

There, her work included curating "Sous un beau ciel bleu: un siècle de couleurs et de photographie" (June 17–October 1, 2006), augmenting the second strand of her research interests, colour photography, into the technological, [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], and social history which she has since pursued investigations alongside stereoscopy.  Timby’s other projects at the Musée Nicéphore Niépce included designing and implementing new permanent exhibition spaces structured around a rotating series of mini-exhibits, thus continuing her informed engagement with a wide audience.

Timby elaborates a cultural history of photography by examining human engagement with, and transformation of, its particular techniques and technologies, as she does with the [[Photo booth|photo-booth]], precursor to the ‘[[Selfie stick|selfie-stick]]’, in her paper “Photographies d’amitié. De l’usage collectif du photomaton,” (‘Photographs of friendships: the collective use of the photo booth’). For the same purpose, she tracks the mid-century development of colour printing technologies for magazine photographs as a response to audiences’ and advertisers’ desire, and the adaptation of photographers, amateur and professional, to its availability and special demands.

== Researching animated photography ==
In a move to alma mater École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in 2009, and until 2012, Timby co-coordinated investigation in "La Création Photographique", a research program in the history of photography funded by the [[Agence nationale de la recherche|Agence Nationale de la Recherche]].

During this period she published a chapter 'Le cinéma dans une seule photo' : le portrait animé des années 1910’, a contribution to a collection of essays on the crossover between cinema and the still image,&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2010). Fixe-animé: Croisements de la photographie et du cinéma au XXe siécle. Paris: L'Age d'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; also reproduced as ‘Cinema in a Single Photo: The Animated Screen Portrait of the 1910s’ in an English edition.&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2012). Between still and moving images: Photography and cinema in the 20th century. London: John Libbey Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Her text first raises the way that lenticular [[animation]], in novelty portraits and advertising, satisfied an expectation of progress toward ever more perceptual [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] in photographic technologies, and this was expanded in the second chapter of her book ''3D and Animated Lenticular Photography: Between Utopia and Entertainment'', published in 2015.

Response to the book was positive and recognised the value of Timby’s contribution to the literature on lenticular imagery which in comparison to the history and analysis of other 3D technologies had received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;reviewed by Jan Baetens, ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]'', October 2016 [https://www.leonardo.info/review/2016/10/review-of-3d-and-animated-lenticular-photography-between-utopia-and-entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’ in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world.

== Teaching ==
Alongside the research affiliation with the EHESS where she was also in charge of a postgraduate seminar, Timby was a professor at the [[Paris College of Art]] from January 2010 to the end of 2012 and is currently, since 2005, professor responsible for the [[École du Louvre]]'s intensive 3-year History of Photography survey course.&lt;ref&gt;Laureline Meizel. ”Images à la sauvette” et papiers gras ou pourquoi et comment se salir les doigts.

The '''law of the handicap of a head start''' (original [[dutch language|Dutch]]: ''[[:nl:Wet van de remmende voorsprong|Wet van de remmende voorsprong]]'') or '''dialectics of lead''' is a theory that suggests that an initial [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in a given area may result in a handicap in the long term. The term was coined in 1937 by [[Jan Romein]], a Dutch [[journalist]] and [[historian]], in his essay "The dialectics of progress" ("De dialectiek van de vooruitgang"), part of the series ''The unfinished past'' (''Het onvoltooid verleden'').

==The phenomenon==
The ''law of the handicap of a head start'' describes a [[phenomenon]] that is applicable in numerous settings. The [[Principle|law]] suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others. In the [[terminology]] of the law, the ''head start'', initially an advantage, subsequently becomes a ''handicap''. 

An explanation for why the phenomenon occurs is that when a society dedicates itself to certain standards, and those standards change, it is harder for them to [[Adaptation|adapt]]. Conversely, a society that has not committed itself yet will not have this problem. Thus, a society that at one point has a head start over other societies, may, at a later time, be stuck with [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] [[technology]] or ideas that get in the way of further progress. One consequence of this is that what is considered to be the [[state of the art]] in a certain field can be seen as "jumping" from place to place, as each leader soon becomes a victim of the handicap. 

In common terms, societies, companies, and individuals are often confronted with the decision to either [[Investment|invest]] now and get a fast return, or put off the investment until a new technology has emerged and possibly make a bigger profit then. For example, a regular problem for individuals is the decision of when to buy a new [[computer]]. Since computer speed develops at a steady pace, delaying the investment for a year may mean having to make do with a slower (or no) computer for the first year, but after that the individual will be able to buy a better computer for the same price. In many cases, however, the technological development is not as predictable as this, so it is harder to make an informed decision.

A related law that can be considered as the contrary of this law is the ''Law of the stimulative arrears'' (''[[:nl:Wet van de stimulerende achterstand|Wet van de stimulerende achterstand]]'') published by Erik van der Hoeven in 1980.&lt;ref name=hoeven&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Hoeven|first=Erik|title=De wet van de stimulerende achterstand|year=1980|publisher=Bakker|location=[[Amsterdam]]|isbn=978-90-6019-742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The author gives an example of the law in his original essay. During a trip to [[London]], he wonders why at that time it was still lit by [[Gas lighting|gas lamps]], rather than [[electric light]]s as were by then common in other [[Europe]]an capitals like [[Amsterdam]]. His explanation was that London's head start—their possession of street lights before most other cities—was now holding them back in replacing them with the more modern electric lights. As the streets were already lit there was no pressing need to replace gas lamps, despite the other advantages of electric lighting.

A modern example—an independent observation given not by the author—the internet situation in the US and Romania. Romania got access to the latest and the greatest equipment in a time where it hadn't laid down any cables, but the US has already done that in the past. Upgrades from the American point of view would like a waste of money, as their equipment is already "doing the job".{{OR|date=December 2017}}

==History==

In January 2000 Ama Ata Aidoo started an initiative called '''Mbaasem''' (meaning "women’s words, women’s affairs" in [[Akan language|Akan]])&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt; based in Accra, Ghana, with the goal of building a women writers' centre and residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wworld.org/archive/annual_report2000.htm Annual Report 1999-2000], Women's WORLD.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently incorporated as a registered non-governmental organization, the Mbaasem Foundation reflects the mission of its founder "to develop and support the sustainability of the work of African women writers who are usually sidelined in the industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kundai Mugwanda-Nyamutenha,

In 2012 Mbaasem launched a three-year project to develop a literacy manifesto to improve the literacy rate within Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Ansah, [http://efeansah1990.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/mbaasem-foundation-launches-manifesto.html "Mbaasem Foundation Launches manifesto To Bridge Literacy Gap"], 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include organizing the "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls", funded by the US Embassy of Ghana and [[The Royal Bank]] Ltd, with GHC 1000 as the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowomanafrica.com/mbaasem-writing-contest-for-girls-deadline-january-31st-2015/ "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls"], ''GoWoman'',

The Mbaasem Foundation has also been involved in international conferences for women writers. In 2013, it collaborated with the [[Organization of Women Writers of Africa]] (OWWA), [[New York University]] (NYU), and the [[Spanish Fundación Mujeres por África]] (Women for Africa Foundation) to present a major conference in Accra, ''Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue – An International Conference on Literature by Women of African Ancestry'', held from 16 to 19 May.&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativewritingghana.wordpress.com/tag/mbaasem/|title=Yari Yari Ntoaso: An International Conference in Ghana on Literature by Women of African Ancestry|publisher=Creative Writing Ghana|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian writers and scholars including Ama Ata Aidoo, [[Amma Darko]], [[Ruby Goka]], [[Mamle Kabu]], [[Esi Sutherland-Addy]] and [[Margaret Busby]] were invited to speak at the event, and among notable participants from other parts of the world who attended were [[Angela Davis]] of the USA, [[Tess Onwueme]] of Nigeria, [[Natalia Molebatsi]] of South Africa, [[Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro]] of Puerto Rico, [[Véronique Tadjo]] of Côte d'Ivoire, and [[Évelyne Trouillot]] of Haiti.&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt;

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Memoria''' was the term for aspects involving [[memory]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is Latin, and can be translated as "memory".

It was one of five canons in classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) concerned with the crafting and delivery of speeches and prose.

The art of rhetoric grew out of [[Public speaking|oratory]], which was the central medium for intellectual and political life in ancient Greece. Legal proceedings, political debates, philosophical inquiry were all conducted through spoken discourse. Many of the great texts from that age were not written texts penned by the authors we associate them with, but were instead orations written down by followers and students. In Roman times, while there was a much greater body of written work, oration was still the medium
for critical debate. Unlike public speakers of today, who use notes or who read their speeches, good orators were expected to deliver their speeches without such aids.

''Memoria'' was the discipline of recalling the arguments of a discourse. It generally received less attention from writers than 
other parts of rhetoric, as there is less to be said about the subject. However, the need to memorize speeches did influence the structure of discourse to some extent. For example, as part of ''dispositio'', some attention was paid to creating structures (such as the ''[[Dispositio|divisio]]'', an outline of the major arguments of a discourse) that would also aid memory. Some writers also discussed the use of various mnemonic devices to assist speakers.

But rhetoricians also viewed ''memoria'' as requiring more than just rote memorization. Rather, the orator also had to have at his command a wide body of knowledge to permit improvisation, to respond to questions, and to refute opposing arguments. Where today's speech-making tends to be a staged, one-way affair, in former times, much oration occurred as part of debates, dialogues, and other settings, in which orators had to react to others. Moreover, rhetoricians also recognized that the credibility of a speaker depended not just on the strength of his prepared arguments, but on the audience's perceptions of the speaker. In Greece, Rome, and the Renaissance, a speaker's familiarity of many areas of learning was seen as a virtue.

==In the Renaissance==
When the Humanists took up the ideas on memory found the writings of Classical authors, memoria played an important role in the pedagogical system. Texts were learned first by rote memorization, then re-read for meaning. Children's ability to memorize was aided by "[[memory table]]s", which were first available in manuscript form, and were, from the 1470s onwards, some of the first products of the printing press. (Source: Paul Gehl, ''A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence'' (1993)

==Memory and Kairos==
Memory, the fourth canon of rhetoric, and invention, the first canon, are connected. The [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|ad Herennium]] states that memory is the “treasury of things invented”, indirectly referring to the custom of accumulating commonplaces. Hence, for a rhetor, memory is as much related to the need to extemporize as to the necessity to memorize a discourse for delivery; in this way it is linked to [[kairos]] and to the ideas of [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]] and amplification (Burton).

Crowley and Hawhee state about memory and kairos, "... kairos and memory were partnered in several ways. First, both require a kind of 'attunement' in that the rhetor who is gathering items for reserve in the memory must be thinking simultaneously about what's available now that might be useful later. Secondly, memory requires an attunement during the moment of speaking or composing, a recognition of the right time for recalling an illustrative example, an argument, and so on" (317).

==Memory Systems==
Ancient peoples used [[Art of memory|elaborate systems]], such as the [[Method of loci|Method of Loci]], to store large amounts of information in their memories. Today, we use literate and electronic memory systems. Literate memory systems include books, periodicals, and libraries. Electronic systems include computers, databases, computer software, the World Wide Web, and other artificial memory devices (Crowley and Hawhee 325-28).

==The Three Elements of the Canon of Memory==
'''Memorizing One's Speech'''
Centuries ago, ancient orators had to memorize and present speeches without the help of note cards or crib sheets. Note taking, as a way to remember certain things, was looked down upon in ancient cultures. In his Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates explaining that relying on writing or taking notes weakened the mind and memory:

''"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves"''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Any Greek in Ancient times who was caught using the note-taking method would be laughed at and deemed "weak-minded".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Nowadays, it is much more common for speakers to use note cards, though speeches are much more impressive without the use of notes.
 
Using memory during a speech can also affect how the orator influences the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the speaker addresses the audiences relying solely on their memory, they build a certain amount of ethos within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cazacu|first=Aurel M.|title=Seneca - The Rhetor.|journal=Annals of Spiru Haret University, Journalism Studies|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=85–87|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memoria in relation to ethos during a speech situation can be described as a certain amount trustworthiness felt between the audience, as well as a level of similarity, authority, or expertise that the orator has over the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Ancient Greece, in today's society, it is much more acceptable for politicians and for people of authority to use aids when delivering addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it could be viewed as an aid to use notes or teleprompters, greater importance is placed on actually conveying the information to the audience in a clear and concise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Making One's Speech Memorable'''
For ancient orators, the excellence of how a speech was presented was more important than the simple delivery of the speech. An important feature of delivering a speech was finding ways to make one's audience remember one's speech topic. One had to be sure to one's audience learned the information or ideas presented to it.

'''Keeping a Treasury of Rhetorical Fodder'''
The third element of memory has to do with using quotes, facts, or anecdotes that could be used in future speeches. A professional orator is known to always have a treasury of rhetorical fodder close at all times.

'''Minimalism''' describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimalist music|music]], where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Frank Stella]]. Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Amy. Styles, Schools and Movements, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002.] "The artists themselves did not like the label because of the negative implication that their work was simplistic and devoid of 'art content'."&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices.

Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at the [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and the [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture''' shown from April 27 - June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine &lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R.

==History==
[[Jean Metzinger]], following the ''[[Succès de scandale]]'' created from the [[Cubist]] showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], in an interview with Cyril Berger published in ''Paris-Journal'' 29 May 1911, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, "Chez Metzi'', interview by Cyril Berger, published in the ''Paris-Journal'', 29 May 1911, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten: ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, 2008, Document 17, Cyril Berger, ''Chez Metzi'', Paris-Journal, 29 May 1911, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take [[abstract art|abstraction]] to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the "primordial white unity", a "completely white canvas" would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto, possibly [[Francis Picabia]], in a publication entitled ''Evolution de l'art: Vers l'amorphisme'', in ''Les Hommes du Jour'' (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt; With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, "''Vers Amorphisme'' may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jj82ZE_ctIoC&amp;pg=PA86 Jeffrey S. Weiss, ''The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-gardism''], Yale University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780300058956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochrome painting was initiated at the first [[Incoherents|Incoherent arts]]' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] entitled "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" (''Negroes fight in a tunnel''). In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer [[Alphonse Allais]] proposed seven other monochrome paintings, such as "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" (''First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow'', white), or "Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux  apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" (''Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea'', red).  However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century [[Dada]], or [[Neo-Dada]], and particularly the works of the [[Fluxus]] group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting [[high modernism]], or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of [[aesthetic]] and sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avant-Garde,'' [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], October, Vol. 37, (Summer, 1986), pp. 41-52   (article consists of 12 pages), Published by: [[The MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 essay  "Last Exit: Painting" [[Artforum]], October: 40-47, minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's &lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this incorrect interpretation of what he said; Greenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.''&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:UntitledGoldBox1964.jpg|thumb|left|[[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], ''Untitled'' (1964), bismuth, chromium, gold, and rhodium on gold-plated brass; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]
In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, Minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], an influential theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1-3", originally published across three issues of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] - "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''[[Artforum]]'', 1969, continuing to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transitions into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.
One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, [[Frank Stella]], whose early "pinstripe" paintings were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's pinstripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in ''Arts Yearbook 8'', 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman Brooklynrail.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticised by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In "Art and Objecthood" (published in ''[[Artforum]]'' in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of ''[[Artforum]]''. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing--namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm interview with Dorothy Strickler] (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words,

"When I brought [[Hans Hofmann|Hofmann]] up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann's reaction was — one of the questions he asked Jackson was, ''do you work from nature?'' There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson's answer was, ''I am nature.'' And Hofmann's reply was, ''Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself.'' To which Jackson did not reply at all." The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;

The Need for Moral Enhancement.''&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;

==Defining moral enhancement==

Moral enhancement in general is sometimes distinguished from MBE specifically, such that ME includes any means of moral improvement while MBE only involves biomedical interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014"&gt;Raus, K., Focquaert, F., Schermer, M., Specker, J., &amp; Sterckx, S. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4 On defining moral enhancement: a clarificatory taxonomy]. ''Neuroethics, 7''(3), 263-273. doi:10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Persson and Savulescu have cited [[moral education]] as an example of socially accepted non-biomedical moral enhancement.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

Some also distinguish invasive from non-invasive, intended from resultant, treatment-focused from enhancement-focused, capability-improving from behavior-improving, and passive from active ME interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014" /&gt; [[Vojin Rakić]] has distinguished voluntary from compulsory MBE, claiming that the former is justifiable even if the latter is not.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a"&gt;Rakić, V. (2014a). [http://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2012-100700 Voluntary moral enhancement and the survival-at-any-cost bias]. ''Journal of medical ethics, 40''(4), 246-250. doi:10.1136/medethics-2012-100700&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rakić, V. (2014b). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889249 Voluntary moral bioenhancement is a solution to Sparrow's concerns]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 37-38. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==

Douglas originally suggested MBE as a counter-example to what he called the "[[bioconservative]] thesis," which claims that [[human enhancement]] is immoral even if it is feasible. He argued that enhancements to reduce "counter-moral" racist and aggressive emotional reactions would at least be morally permissible.&lt;ref name = "Douglas 2008" /&gt;

[[Mark Alan Walker]] proposed a "Genetic Virtue Project" to genetically enhance moral traits. Given that personality traits are heritable, and some traits are moral while others are immoral, he suggested increasing moral traits while reducing immoral ones through [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. (2009, September). [http://doi.org/10.2990/28_2_27 Enhancing genetic virtue: A project for twenty-first century humanity?]. ''Politics and the life sciences, 28''(2), 27-47. doi:10.2990/28_2_27&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the fact that human technological progress has advanced faster than human moral psychology can adapt through evolution, Persson &amp; Savulescu point out that humans' capability to cause large-scale destruction has increased exponentially. However, given that humans tend to care only about their immediate acquaintances and circumstances instead of thinking on a larger scale, they are vulnerable to [[Tragedy of the commons|tragedies of the commons]] like climate change and to technologies like nuclear weapons which pose an [[existential threat]] to humanity. Given that moral education and [[liberal democracy]] are insufficient, MBE is needed at least as a supplementary method to solve these problems.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Central issues debated in the MBE literature include whether there is an urgent need for MBE, a sufficient consensus on the definition of morality, some technically feasible and ethically permissible interventions to carry out MBE, no violation of consent in those interventions, and no harmful social side-effects that they produce.&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt;

===Sufficiency of non-biomedical methods===

Terri Murray disputed the claim by Persson &amp; Savulescu that political will and moral education are insufficient to address the major problems facing humanity, claiming that Persson &amp; Savulescu unjustly reify moral dispositions in biology.&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012"&gt;Murray, T. (2012). [https://philosophynow.org/issues/93/The_Incoherence_of_Moral_Bioenhancement The incoherence of moral bioenhancement]. ''Philosophy now, 93'', 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical basis of moral enhancement===

Since the nature of morality has historically caused wide disagreements, several authors have questioned whether it is possible to come up with a sufficiently widely accepted ethical basis for MBE, especially with respect to what qualities should be enhanced.&lt;ref name = "Paulo et al 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, B. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12090 Conceptual and practical problems of moral enhancement]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 233-240. doi:10.1111/bioe.12090&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feasibility===

MBE proponents have been accused of being too speculative, overstating the capabilities of future interventions and describing unrealistic scenarios like enhancing "all of humanity."&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt; One literature review assessed the evidence on seven interventions cited by MBE proponents, finding all of them ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Dubljević, V., &amp; Racine, E. (2017, May 15). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12355 Moral enhancement meets normative and empirical reality: Assessing the practical feasibility of moral enhancement neurotechnologies]. ''Bioethics, 31''(5), 338-348. doi:10.1111/bioe.12355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of individual choice===

Other authors have suggested that unless MBE is based on an individual's choice, it cannot truly be called "moral" enhancement because personal choice is the basis of ethics.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melo‐Martin, I., &amp; Salles, A. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12100 Moral bioenhancement: much ado about nothing?]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 223-232. doi:10.1111/bioe.12100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social equality===

If MBE is more effective for enhancing people that are already moral, then it could increase the gap between moral and immoral people, increasing social inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Ram-Tiktin, E. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889246 The possible effects of moral bioenhancement on political privileges and fair equality of opportunity]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 43-44. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if MBE makes some people morally better, it could unfairly raise the moral standards for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, A. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12251 Moral enhancement and those left behind]. ''Bioethics, 30''(7), 500-510. doi:10.1111/bioe.12251&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">'''Morisita's overlap index''', named after [[:ja:森下正明|Masaaki Morisita]], is a [[dispersion (statistics)|statistical measure of dispersion]] of individuals in a population.  It is used to compare overlap among [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] (Morisita 1959).  This formula is based on the assumption that increasing the size of the samples will increase the diversity because it will include different habitats (i.e. different faunas).

Formula:

: &lt;math&gt;C_D= \frac{2\sum_{i=1}^S x_i y_i }{(D_x + D_y) XY }&lt;/math&gt;

: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of times species ''i'' is represented in the total ''X'' from one sample.
: ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of times species ''i'' is represented in the total ''Y'' from another sample.
: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Simpson's index]] values for the ''x'' and ''y'' samples respectively.
: ''S'' is the number of unique species

''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 if the two samples do not overlap in terms of species, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 if the species occur in the same proportions in both samples.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Horn's modification of the index is (Horn 1966):
:&lt;math&gt;C_H= \frac{ 2 \sum_{i=1}^S x_i y_i }{ \left( {\sum_{i=1}^S x_i^2 \over X^2} + {\sum_{i=1}^S y_i^2 \over Y^2} \right) X Y } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Nadia Samdani''' (born 12 December 1981) is a British-born Bangladeshi philanthropist, art patron and collector. She is the co-founder and president of the Samdani Art Foundation, and director of the Dhaka Art Summit. She is also the director of Golden Harvest Group, a leading Bangladeshi conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenharvestbd.com/managemet/|title=Directors Profile – Golden Harvest|website=www.goldenharvestbd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.samdani.com.bd/our-team/|title=OUR TEAM|website=Samdani Art Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Nadia and her husband Rajeeb Samdani were donors for the 56th International Biennale di Venezia in 2015, supporting projects by [[Naeem Mohaiemen]] and Raqs Media Collective in the main Biennale exhibition: All the World's Futures. They have also supported [[Naeem Mohaiemen]]'s first European Solo exhibition "Prisoners of Shothik Itihash" at [[Kunsthalle Basel]], curated by [[Adam Szymczyk]] in 2014, and Bangladeshi-British artist Rana Begum's first major institutional solo exhibition at The Parasol Unit in 2016.

The '''orgasmatron''' is a fictional electromechanical device that appears in the [[1973 in film|1973 movie]] ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', which also shows the effects of a related device, an '''orgasmic orb'''. Similar devices have appeared in other fictional works. The term has also been applied to a non-fictional device capable of triggering an orgasm-like sensation using [[electrode]]s implanted at the lower spine.

Author [[Christopher Turner]] has suggested that the orgasmatron was a parody of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s [[orgone]] accumulator.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter D. |last=Kramer |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2297527/ |title=The Great Proselytizer of Orgasm |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Orgasmatron is Woody Allen's name, in Sleeper, for a parody of Reich's orgone accumulator, a telephone booth-sized plywood and metal box said to store a healing and enlivening force. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron |title=Wilhelm Reich: the man who invented free love |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Woody Allen parodied it in Sleeper (1973), giving it the immortal nickname the "Orgasmatron". }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Sleeper'' (1973)==
The orgasmatron is a fictional device in the fictional future society of 2173 in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''. It is a large cylinder big enough to contain one or two people. The orgasmatron was made by decorating an [[elevator]] in the home where the movie was filmed. Once entered, it contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology that rapidly induces [[orgasm]]s. This is required, as almost all people in the ''Sleeper'' universe are [[impotent]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigid]], although males of Italian descent are considered the least impotent of all groups.

The main character Miles Monroe, played by Allen, is being hunted by the police as being [[subversive]] to security of the state, and attempts to hide in it, thinking it is a closet. He is discovered there, and easily captured in a daze, with a sheepish smile on his face.

Another related device, an orb, also appears in this movie. It is a silver-colored sphere about the size of a [[grapefruit]] that contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology. When the orb is touched by a human, it induces pleasurable sensations. In a scene where Miles impersonates a [[robot]]ic servant, he is ordered by the hostess to pass the orb among the guests. Unlike the robot he is imitating, he is not immune to the effects of the orb. Much physical humor results from his reaction to firmly holding this device, which party participants only lightly caress.

Later on, they encounter a [[gay]] male couple, one of whom offers Miles a "hit off the orb". Miles reports that he's "cool" and does not need to indulge. It appears the effect of the orb is more like social [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]] or [[drug|drug use]], pleasurable rather than orgasmic.

==Similar concepts==
Similar devices are:

===In ''Barbarella'' (1964)===
(Referred to in both the [[Barbarella (comics)|comic]] and 1968 [[Barbarella (film)|film]]—the description below refers to the film.)

The device has been invented by Dr. Durand-Durand, the evil antagonist in ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. Instead of being called an Orgasmatron, Durand-Durand refers to it as the Excessive Machine. It resembles a clamshell that once grasping the passenger's entire body below the neck, gently (at first) and pleasurably massages the passenger by flexing its upper half with a wave-like motion from right to left. The lid is made of long, rigid rod-like paddles that lie in a row, side by side. The paddles themselves each have one end at the bottom of the lid, near the joint of the Excessive Machine's "clamshell", and the other end moves freely. Because the paddles are not glued or welded together but instead move together, and because the paddles pivot around the "clamshell" joint and move parallel to the [[sagittal plane]], they can have this wave-like motion. It is operated from a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] resembling that used to control a large [[organ (music)|organ]]. By properly manipulating the keys the operator may induce great sexual pleasure in the victim, sufficient to cause death by [[orgasm]]. In one of the final scenes of the movie the evil opponent is torturing Barbarella with the pleasures of this machine, during which she vocalises extensively ("oh", "ooh", "ahh", etc.). But in the end the machine overloads and is destroyed, while she survives, and feels rather well.

See [[Magic Mountain (1973)]] by Jadorowski for another orgasmatron.

===In ''Flesh Gordon'' (1974)===
In the 1974 film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'', a [[ribaldry|ribald]] parody of the science fiction adventures of [[Flash Gordon]], the villain "Emperor Wang" directs a "sex ray" at Earth which causes the planet's inhabitants to become uncontrollably sexually aroused.

===In ''Orgasmatron'' (1986)===
''[[Orgasmatron (album)|Orgasmatron]]'' is the seventh album by the British band [[Motörhead]], released in 1986. It is the only full Motörhead album to feature [[Pete Gill]] on the [[Drum kit|drums]], although he also played on the four new tracks recorded for the 1984 ''[[No Remorse (Motörhead album)|No Remorse]]'' [[compilation album]].

=== In ''Coneheads'' (1993) ===
"Senso-rings" were used in the movie ''[[Coneheads]]'' to provide pleasure to the other partner.

=== In ''Demolition Man'' (1993) ===
John Spartan (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) is introduced to an orgasmatron-like device by [[Lenina Huxley|Lt. Lenina Huxley]] ([[Sandra Bullock]]) in the 1993 movie ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''. The device is in widespread use in the film's future world, since actual sex ("fluid exchange") has been deemed unsafe and become both illegal and socially taboo.

===In ''Orgazmo'' (1997)===
In ''[[Orgazmo]]'', the "Orgazmorator" was built in the form of an oversized water gun. It was operated by pointing it at a subject and firing. Apparently, it could even generate multiple successive orgasms in a man.

==Non-fictional orgasmatron==

===Surgically implanted devices===
{{see also|Wirehead (science fiction)}}

Discovered serendipitously as a potential side effect of a [[spinal cord stimulator]] used in pain relief, the medical "orgasmatron" device has been judged effective by some recipients, but costs $3,000 and requires surgical insertion of electrodes near the [[spinal cord]]. Invented by Dr. Stuart Meloy in [[Winston-Salem]], the device employs a [[function generator]] manufactured by Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME Corp.). It has been described as being of great potential in treating sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/story?id=235788&amp;|title=Doctor Discovers the 'Orgasmatron'|date=2004-11-09|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Call him doctor 'Orgasmatron' |first1=Regina |last1=Nuzzo |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-he-orside11feb11,1,5212599.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |oclc=71790328 |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |quote=Dr. Stuart Meloy stumbled upon an alternative -- and pleasurable -- use for an electrode stimulation device that treats pain. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device and its inventor were featured in the first episode of the seventh season of the Showtime show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''

A wide variety of foods were tested using this method, with certain [[spice]]s, [[berries]] and [[legume]]s rated highly in extensive tables once published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Alternative measurements include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.

==Method==
The [[assay]] measures the oxidative degradation of the fluorescent molecule (either beta-phycoerythrin or [[fluorescein]]) after being mixed with free radical generators such as [[Azo compound|azo-initiator compounds]]. Azo-initiators are considered to produce the [[peroxyl radical]] by heating, which damages the fluorescent molecule, resulting in the loss of fluorescence. [[Antioxidant]]s are considered to protect the fluorescent molecule from the oxidative degeneration.  The degree of protection is quantified using a [[fluorometer]]. Fluorescein is currently used most as a fluorescent probe.  Equipment that can automatically measure and calculate the capacity is commercially available (Biotek, Roche Diagnostics).

The fluorescent intensity decreases as the oxidative degeneration proceeds, and this intensity is typically recorded for 35 minutes after the addition of the azo-initiator (free radical generator). So far, AAPH (2,2’-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride) is the sole free-radical generator used. The degeneration (or decomposition) of fluorescein  is measured as the presence of the antioxidant slows the fluorescence decay. Decay curves (fluorescence intensity vs. time) are recorded and the area between the two decay curves (with or without antioxidant) is calculated. Subsequently, the degree of antioxidant-mediated protection is quantified using the antioxidant [[trolox]] (a vitamin E analogue) as a standard. Different concentrations of trolox are used to make a standard curve, and test samples are compared to this. Results for test samples (foods) have been published as "trolox equivalents" or TEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang D, Ou B, Prior RL | title = The chemistry behind antioxidant capacity assays | journal = J. Agric. Food Chem. | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 1841–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15769103 | doi = 10.1021/jf030723c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garrett_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garrett AR, Murray BK, Robison RA, O'Neill KL | title = Measuring antioxidant capacity using the ORAC and TOSC assays | journal = Methods Mol. Biol. | volume = 594 | issue = | pages = 251–62 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20072922 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60761-411-1_17 | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | isbn = 978-1-60761-410-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One benefit of using the ORAC method to evaluate substances' antioxidant capacities is that it takes into account samples with and without lag phases of their antioxidant capacities. This is especially beneficial when measuring foods and supplements that contain complex ingredients with various slow- and fast-acting antioxidants, as well as ingredients with combined effects that cannot be precalculated.

Drawbacks of this method are: 1) only antioxidant activity against particular (probably mainly peroxyl) radicals is measured; however, peroxyl radical formation has never been proven; 2) the nature of the damaging reaction is not characterized; 3) there is no evidence that free radicals are involved in this reaction; and 4) there is no evidence that ORAC values have any biological significance following consumption of any food. Moreover, the relationship between ORAC values and a health benefit has not been established.

Resulting from scientific refutation of the physiological significance of ORAC, the USDA, which had been collating and publishing ORAC data for more than a decade, withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in May 2012.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;

Several modified ORAC methods have been proposed.  Most of them employ the same principle (i.e. measurement of AAPH-radical mediated damage of fluorescein); however, ORAC-EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance-based ORAC method directly measures the decrease of AAPH-radical level by the scavenging action of the antioxidant substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohri S, Fujii H, Oowada S, Endoh N, Sueishi Y, Kusakabe M, Shimmei M, Kotake Y | title = An oxygen radical absorbance capacity-like assay that directly quantifies the antioxidant's scavenging capacity against AAPH-derived free radicals | journal = Anal.

==Regulatory guidance==
In the following discussion, the term "antioxidant" refers mainly to non-nutrient compounds in foods, such as [[polyphenol]]s, which have antioxidant capacity'' [[in vitro]]'', so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength—the ORAC measurement.

Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins—[[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]]—no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy ''[[in vivo]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Accordingly, regulatory agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) have published guidance forbidding food product labels to claim or imply an antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/ucm063064.htm Guidance for Industry, Food Labeling; Nutrient Content Claims; Definition for "High Potency" and Definition for "Antioxidant" for Use in Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements and Conventional Foods] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1489 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489 |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061 |author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |journal=EFSA Journal |year=2010 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=1489}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance for the United States and European Union establishes it is illegal to imply potential health benefits on package labels of products with high ORAC.

==Physiological context==
Although research ''in vitro'' indicates [[polyphenol]]s are good [[antioxidant]]s and probably influence the ORAC value, antioxidant effects ''in vivo'' are probably negligible or absent.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C 2004 838–49"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C | title = Flavonoids: antioxidants or signalling molecules? | journal = Free Radic. Biol. Med. | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 838–49  | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15019969 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By ''non''-antioxidant mechanisms still undefined, [[flavonoid]]s and other polyphenols may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arts IC, Hollman PC | title = Polyphenols and disease risk in epidemiologic studies | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 81 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 317S–325S | year = 2005 | pmid = 15640497 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15640497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As interpreted by the [[Linus Pauling Institute]], EFSA and the USDA, dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C 2004 838–49"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Lotito&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lotito SB, Frei B | title = Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and increased plasma antioxidant capacity in humans: cause, consequence, or epiphenomenon? | journal = Free Radic. Biol. Med. | volume = 41 | issue = 12 | pages = 1727–46 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17157175 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not like controlled test tube conditions, the fate of polyphenols ''in vivo'' shows they are poorly conserved (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed existing as chemically modified metabolites destined for rapid excretion.&lt;ref name="LPI"&gt;"[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/osu-sfn030507.php Studies force new view on biology of flavonoids]", by David Stauth, ''EurekAlert!''. Adapted from a news release issued by Oregon State University&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of polyphenol-rich (ORAC-rich) foods is not caused directly by the polyphenols, but most likely results from increased [[uric acid]] levels derived from metabolism of flavonoids.&lt;ref name = Lotito/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt; According to Frei, "we can now follow the activity of flavonoids in the body, and one thing that is clear is that the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them."&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt;

==Food sources==
Values are expressed as the sum of the [[lipid]] soluble (e.g. [[carotenoid]]) and [[water-soluble]] (e.g. [[polyphenol|phenolic]]) antioxidant fractions (i.e., “total ORAC”) reported as in micromoles [[trolox]] equivalents (TE) per 100&amp;nbsp;gram sample, and are compared to assessments of total polyphenol content in the samples.

These values are considered biologically irrelevant by the EFSA and USDA.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt;

With nearly all vegetables, conventional boiling can reduce the ORAC value by up to 90%, while steaming retains more of the antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ninfali P, Mea G, Giorgini S, Rocchi M, Bacchiocca M | title = Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition | journal = Br. J. Nutr. | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–66 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15788119 | doi = 10.1079/BJN20041327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons of ORAC values==

The United States Department of Agriculture, previously a publisher of ORAC data, withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in 2012 due to absence of scientific evidence that ORAC has any biological significance.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;

When comparing ORAC data, care must be taken to ensure the units and food being compared are similar. Some evaluations will compare ORAC units per gram of dry weight of the intact food or its milled powder, others will evaluate ORAC units in fresh or frozen wet weight, and still others will look at ORAC units per serving. Under each evaluation, different foods can appear to have higher ORAC values. For example, although a raisin has no more antioxidant potential than the grape from which it was dried, raisins will appear to have a higher ORAC value per gram of wet weight than grapes due to their reduced water content. Likewise, the large water content in watermelon can make it appear as though this fruit is low in ORAC. Similarly, the typical quantity of food used should be considered; herbs and spices may be high in ORAC, but are applied in much smaller quantities compared to intact whole foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, Patch CS, Sullivan DR, Fenech M, Roodenrys S, Keogh JB, Clifton PM, Williams PG, Fazio VA, Inge KE | title = Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future | journal = Med. J. Aust. | volume = 185 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = S4–24 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17022438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous health food and beverage companies and marketers have erroneously capitalized on the ORAC rating by promoting products claimed to be "high in ORAC". As most of these ORAC values have not been independently validated or subjected to [[peer review]] for publication in scientific literature, they remain unconfirmed, are not scientifically credible, and may mislead consumers.

It was launched on {{Date|2009-11-2}}, with the [[Rockot]] launch system together with [[ESA]]'s [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |title=Successful launch qualification test for PROBA-2 |date=2008-09-16 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074327/http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was launched in a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]] (altitude of 725&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

PROBA-2 contains five scientific instruments. Two of them are designated to observe the [[Sun]]: "The Sun Watcher using APS and Image Processing" ([[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]], an EUV imager) and the "Large Yield Radiometer" ([[LYRA]]), a radiometer made of diamond photodiodes. The Principal investigator teams of both instruments are hosted at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]. This institute will also host the [http://proba2.oma.be PROBA-2 Science Center]  from which the [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] and [[LYRA]] instruments will be operated and their data distributed. There are three other instruments to measure basic space plasma properties: the [[Dual segmented Langmuir probe]] (DSLP)&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; (developed by the [[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Astronomical Institute]] and Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), the Thermal Plasma Measurement Unit (TPMU), and the Science Grade Vector Magnetometer (SGVM) developed by the [[Technical University of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

According to SIU, "Tens of thousands of rated and licensed seamen have completed upgrading classes at the training center. Additionally, more than 21,000 men and women from every state in the U.S., Puerto Rico and several U.S. territories have graduated from the trainee program for those just beginning their maritime careers."&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

The center features a number of buildings, including:&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;
* The Joseph Sacco Fire Fighting and Safety School
* The Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship
* The Thomas B. Crowley Sr. Education Center
* The Paul Hall Library and Maritime Museum
* The Romeo Lupinacci Culinary lab

Prior to the opening of the Paul Hall Center, SIU maintained training facilities at five different ports.  In 1966, the union bought the Piney Point site.  The program grew to include other offerings, such as a reading skills program, a  high-school equivalency program, an adult basic skills program, and English as a Second Language program.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

In 1978, SIU entered into an arrangement with [[Charles County Community College]] of Maryland which allows participants to earn an Associates of Arts degree.  In 1993, the Maryland Higher Education Commission authorized the college program to change its degree award to an Associate of Applied Science degree and to a certificate program in Maritime Technology.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

== Training programs ==
Professional training begins with basic or entry-level vocational education programs. 
* Unlicensed Apprentice Program
* Deck Upgrading Courses
* Engine Department Upgrading Courses
* Steward Department Upgrading Courses
* Other Miscellaneous Courses
* Passenger Vessel Training
The upgrading programs provide experienced seafarers the opportunity to advance their professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/maryland/paul-hall-center-for-maritime-training-and-education Paul Hall Center Maritime Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''pointing-out instruction''' (''ngo sprod'') is the direct introduction to the [[rigpa|nature of mind]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] lineages of  [[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]]. In these traditions, a "root guru"{{refn|group=note|(S. ''mūlaguru'', {{bo|w=rtsa-ba'i bla-ma}} [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]] ''tsawé lama''}} gives the "pointing-out instruction" in such a way that the disciple successfully recognizes the "nature of mind."

The tradition of conferring such instructions outside the context of formal [[empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] ({{lang-sa|abhiṣeka}}) is unique to the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages. Whether or not such instructions are valid without the formal empowerment has historically been a point of contention with the more conservative [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] lineages.  The pointing-out instruction is often equated with the fourth formal vajrayana empowerment.

==Terminology==

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, pointing-out instruction ({{bo|w=ngo sprod kyi gdams pa}} ''ngotrö kyi dampa'') is also referred to as "pointing out the nature of mind" ({{bo|w=sems kyi ngo sprod}} ''sem kyi ngotrö''), "pointing out transmission", or "introduction to the nature of mind".&lt;ref name="hayward106"&gt;Hayward (2008) p.106&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/ref&gt; or "sems khrid," pronounced "sem tri".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David F. (1994). "Architecture and Absence in the Secret Tantric History of rDzogs Chen". In The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, vol. 17.2, p 228 {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007232626/https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior [[Shambhala Buddhism|Shambhala Buddhist]] teacher Jeremy Hayward describes this as 
{{quote|[A] direct pointing out of the nature of mind, that is mind's simplicity and universality—all appearances arise within the mind and in that sense there is nothing ''other'' than mind, yet mind itself is emptiness, openness beyond concept."&lt;ref name="hayward106" /&gt;}}

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, the mind pointed out is called "ordinary mind" ({{bo|w=tha mal gyi shes pa}} ''tamel gyi shépa'', Sanskrit: *''prākṛita-jñana'').&lt;ref&gt;''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism'' by Chögyam Trungpa. Shambhala Publications: 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-59030-639-0}} Page 68&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] explains, 
{{quote|From the Mahamudra point of view, the nature of our mind is completely enlightened right from the beginning, and it is known as ordinary mind. In this context, 'ordinary' does not refer to mundane consciousness—a mind that  is totally caught up in this world of [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]]. Ordinary mind refers to Mind that is not fabricated in any way. It is the natural or fundamental state of our mind, totally free from all conceptual elaborations. It is the best part of Mind. When we experience this ordinary Mind, we experience buddha Mind. It does not matter how our mind is manifesting. Whether our thoughts and emotions are positive, negative, or neutral—that mind, in its essence, is totally free from all dualistic fixations.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009 [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2009/9/1/pointing-out-ordinary-mind.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Dzogchen tradition, knowledge of the basis pointed out is called ''[[rigpa]]'' ({{bo|w=rig pa}}, Sanskrit: *''vidya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html Description of the word's meaning by Sogyal Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501132909/http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the pointing-out instruction is referred to as "the empowerment of vajra wisdom,"&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra and Dzogchen'' by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche Shambhala: 2003. {{ISBN|1-59030-096-3}} pg34&lt;/ref&gt; "vajrayana transmission" or "esoteric transmission," although these terms can also be applied to formal abhiṣeka as well.

==Mahāmudrā==
As scholar David Jackson describes, the particular Kagyu tradition of pointing-out instruction outside the tantras was popularized, if not originated, by [[Gampopa]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the special Great Seal (''phyag rgya chen po: mahāmudrā'') teachings for which sGam-po-pa was best known was his so-called "introduction to the [nature of] Mind" (''sems kyi ngo sprod''), by which the disciple was led to confront and directly recognize the nature of his or her mind. sGam-po-pa is said to have given such Great Seal instructions sometimes not as secret Vajrayana precepts in connection with initiation and special yogic practices, but rather as a Sūtra-based Great Seal instruction, or even as a doctrine going beyond both Sūtra and Tantra. Later critics such as Sa-skya Paṇḍita (or Sa-paṇ, as he was known for short) maintained, however, that all true Great Seal instructions were Mantrayana teachings that necessitated full, formal Tantric initiation into a maṇḍala. These masters denied in general the existence of any Sūtra-based or non-Tantric Great Seal, and in particular they considered the existence of any Mahāyāna doctrine outside the classes of Pāramitāyāna and Mantrayāna to be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment By A Single: Means Tibetan Controversies on the "Self-Sufficient White Remedy" (dkar po chig thub)'' by David Jackson. VERLAG DER OSTERREICHISCHEN AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFFEN. Vienna: 1994 {{ISBN|3-7001-2162-8}} pg &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/23509786/Enlightenment-by-a-Single-Means-Tibetan-Controversies-on-the-Self-Sufficient-White-Remedy]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson reports that, according to a number of Kagyu historians, Gampopa put particular emphasis on pointing out the nature of Mind. Jackson writes 
{{quote|rJe sGam-po-pa had discovered within himself the treasure of innate wisdom, and for him it was also essential to try to convey it to others. And convey it he did, on a scale never before attempted within his lineage. To do so, he bent the traditional rules restricting how certain Vajrayana teachings could be transmitted. He did this out of compassion for his students, in order to establish them in what was most important: profound meditative practice and insight."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is evidence that this practice derived from (unacknowledged) [[Zen#Ch.C3.A1n in China|Chan]] influence, a controversial issue in Tibet. As scholar Matthew Kapstein writes, the 
{{quote|... much contested doctrine sometimes called the 'mahamudra of the sutra tradition' (mdo-lugs phyag-chen) [...] was said to bring about direct insight into the ultimate nature of Mind, owing to the impact of an 'introduction' (ngo-sprod; see chapter 10) conferred by one's teacher, without the disciple's having first traversed the entire sequence of tantric initiation and yogic practice [...] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Gampopa and other Kagyüpa teachers&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; certainly wished to avoid suggesting that what they were teaching was a rehashing of the Chinese Chan doctrine, which after all had been condemned in the Kadampa tradition of the eleventh-century teacher Potowa (1027 or 1031–1105), a tradition with which Gampopa was himself closely affiliated.&lt;br&gt;This ploy, however, was not fully successful. Sakya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), for one, recognized very clearly that the Kagyüpa teaching drew some of its inspiration from such sources, and so he castigated its 'sutra tradition of the mahamudra' as what he termed, with apparent derision, 'Chinese Great Perfection' (''Rgya-nag rdzogs-chen'')."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory" by Matthew T. Kapstein. Oxford University Press, USA {{ISBN|0-19-513122-3}} pg 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

How much of a departure this in fact represented from the Indian model has been a subject of ongoing research. As scholar Klaus-Dieter Mathes has found:
{{quote|Certain aspects of the Bka´ brgyud teachings on mahāmudrā, such as the possibility of a sudden liberating realization or the possibility that a beginner may attain mahāmudrā even without Tantric initiation, became a highly controversial issue in the 13th century. For Sa skya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), such teachings represented a new development stemming from a Sino-Tibetan influence on Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079–1153). Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung) [...] Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha´s dohās it is simply the realization of Mind´s co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripa|Maitrīpa]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Maitripa&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1007– ca. 1085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Bka´ brgyud pas to speak of Saraha´s mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that Mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa." Centre for Tantric Studies website. {{cite web |url=http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820095822/http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to scholar Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa, introduction (''ngo sprod'') 
{{quote|... is explained by Gampopa as being of five types:&lt;br&gt;1) introduction of appearance as mind through the analogy of sleep and dream,&lt;br&gt;2) introduction of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness through the analogy of water and ice,&lt;br&gt;3) introduction of mind-as-such as empty through the analogy of empty sky,&lt;br&gt;4) introduction of multiplicity as being one taste through the analogy of the taste of a cake of raw sugar."&lt;ref&gt;"Gampopa, the Monk and the Yogi: His Life and Teachings." by Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa. PhD dissertation, Harvard:2004 pg 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trungram notes that Gampopa uses 
{{quote|"terms we find in the Mahāmudrā instruction of Saraha, Maitrīpa, and sometimes Tillipa. But his actual instruction is marked by one major difference: Gampopa ignores the methodical mantric path we find in his predecessors" and "taught openly in public, without testing the spiritual capacity of his students [...] the permissibility of teaching Gampopa's Mahāmudrā to the masses . . . lead us to view his publicly taught Mahāmudrā as a sutra teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Trungram pg 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mahāmudrā tradition also includes a "fourfold pointing-out instructions" (pointing out the nature of Mind on the basis of appearances) presented by Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje]] in his three texts on mahāmudrā.

==Dzogchen==
{{see also|Direct Introduction}}
In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are more often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection" by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "direct introduction" (Tibetan: ངོ་སྤྲོད་སྤྲས་པ, Wylie: ''ngo sprod spras pa'', literally "directly encountering one's own state"). The "Empowerment of Awareness" ({{bo|w=rig pa'i rtsal dbang}}, pronounced "rigpay sall wahng") is a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by [[Jigme Lingpa]]. This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind-essence, [[rigpa]], by their empowering master.&lt;ref name="DharmaFellowship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/pramodavajra.htm |title=Biographies: Pramodavajra, Regent of the Divine|accessdate=2007-11-15 |work=Dharma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gwayala Karmapa|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albion Moonlight Butters notes, 
{{quote|Students of ''rDzogs chen'' are repeatedly reminded of the inherent perfection of the beginningless beginning. The primary purpose of the guru's pointing out instructions--be they verbal or symbolic or telepathic--is to provide a taste of this, to introduce the student to his or her own natural awareness. From there, one needs only to sustain that way of being (''gnas lugs''), deepening the experience until all things have that unitary taste (''ro gcig'').&lt;ref&gt;The Doxographical Genius of Kunmkhyen kLong chen rab 'byams pa. by Albion Moonlight Butters. PhD dissertation, Columbia: 2006 pg 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] describes the pointing out instructions given by Patrul Rinpoche to Nyoshul Lungtok:
:Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

:"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
:"Yes."
:"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."
:Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: Revised and Updated Edition. by Sogyal Rinpoche (Author), Patrick D. Gaffney (Editor), Andrew Harvey (Editor) HarperOne: 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-250834-2}} pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effectivity==
According to Dzogchen master [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], 
{{quote|Once one has received the pointing-out instruction there is the chance of either recognizing it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Interview for ''Vajradhatu Sun'', 1985&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/tulku_urgyen_rinpoche-interview.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Newman, a long-time student of Tulku Urgyen's son, [[Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche]], describes the possible responses of the student to the pointing out instruction:

:So at this point one of two things may have happened: You've had some experience that you think or hope is the experience, or you haven't. If you haven't, you can report, "Rinpoche, I've been trying to meditate on what you said when you said, 'Mind is empty.' But nothing has happened. I don't understand{{mdash}}I have no idea what you're talking about! Can you give me one word of advice on how to proceed?" Then you take that advice and start all over. A word of caution: he may not answer you straight away. He might say that you have to do some other practice, such as the preliminary practices, to clear away obstacles to your understanding. Complete these practices to his satisfaction then report back for further clarification and instruction, for however long it takes. At this point you'll know that your practice is proceeding in the right direction.

:If you had some experience, report back for confirmation. Don't assume you've understood. There are countless ways to get it wrong, and if you do, it will make the rest of your practice wobbly, since it will based on a wrong view. It would be like building a house on a rotten foundation.

:When you report back, you can say, "Rinpoche, in your teaching you said that Mind was empty. Since then I've been trying to meditate on your words and I've had the following experience..." It's very difficult to put these kinds of experiences into words, but please try; it's really worth the effort. Study helps here{{mdash}}it provides you with the vocabulary to explain yourself. So you might ask, "Is this really it?" He might ask you several questions, often to discern whether you're talking about a real experience or mostly mixing it up with what you've read or heard. If he says "no," "not quite," etc., then you go back to the beginning. If it's a definite "yes," then ask for further clarification, some instruction on how to proceed. Even if you have recognized and your teacher has unequivocally confirmed your recognition, there's still much more to learn. First are the techniques for repeating and stabilizing the recognition. (This is, of course, many lifetimes of work!) Second, there will be doubts, and you'll have experiences you're not sure how to categorize. "Was that last experience really rigpa? Perhaps it wasn't empty enough." This can go on for a long time. The doubting and questioning can start to become problematic after a while, but it's very necessary in the beginning to make sure you have it right.&lt;ref&gt;''A Beginner's Guide To Tibetan Buddhism'' by Bruce Newman. Snow Lion Publications. 1559392118&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N66_5.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, few contemporary disciples are capable of recognition, even when receiving pointing out instructions from superior masters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once I witnessed Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche give the pointing out instruction to a gathering of more than one thousand people in Taiwan. He still gave the real thing nakedly and directly, leaving nothing out. This must exemplify what they call the 'expression of compassionate capacity,' for he rose to the occasion out of the power of his realization. He said, 'The oral instruction is like a candle: you can see while you hold it, and when you give it away you have no more light. But since all of you have taken the trouble to come here, expecting to hear me speak, I feel that I cannot refuse giving you the pointing-out instruction.' Then he gave the instruction in coming face to face with your own nature. Even if the great Khyentse, Kongtrül or Longchenpa were doing so, it wouldn't surpass his instruction. Yet I later met only a few there who truly recognized their own nature. Even among Rinpoche's Western students there were some very close disciples who definitely should have recognized their buddha nature. They probably had some vague glimpse of recognition; yet they use empty words, and ignore the consequences of their actions. I have yet to meet one who has fully realized his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: Essays and interviews by ten lamas surrounding the passing of a great master&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gomde.dk/pages/interviews/turgyen/9-lamas.htm#8 Spoken by Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche characterizes recognition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Receiving pointing-out instructions is similar to watching a movie preview. Unless we see the preview, we have no idea what the movie will be about. So a preview is an excellent way to be introduced to what a particular movie might be like. We might see the preview and then decide to skip the film{{mdash}}that is up to us. No one is going to force us to sit through the whole movie.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, we get a preview of the Mahamudra experience when we receive the pointing-out instructions from our guru. They give us a glimpse or flash experience of Mahamudra. They give us a sense of direction and motivate us to go further; however, it is up to us to extend our exploration so that we eventually come to a genuine realization of Mahamudra. Without this flash experience, we would have no way to be exposed to the nature of Mind so directly, so nakedly. That flash is a transmission of the lineage, a wonderful blessing through which we are introduced to the deeper experience and realization of the Mahamudra path. This shows how necessary it is to rely on the lineage transmission and to be connected to a genuine lineage master. Without the pure and genuine lineage, without a qualified lineage master, we would have no way to experience such a preview, such a flash experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2009/fall/ordinary.php]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secrecy==
This conspicuous aspect of Vajrayana Buddhism is [[esoteric]].  In this context esoteric means that the transmission of certain accelerating factors only occurs directly from teacher to student during an initiation and cannot be simply learned from a book. The term [[adhisthana]] (literally "blessing") refers to the spiritual energy that is received in the [[mindstream]] of the aspirant when successful transmission takes place.

Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that the secrecy itself is not important but only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.  As these techniques are said to be highly effective, when not practiced properly, the practitioner can be harmed physically and mentally. In order to avoid these kind of dangers, the practice is kept secret.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

According to the Dalai Lama in the "Tradition of Mahamudra":&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/gelug_kagyu_mahamudra/pt4/mm_15.html Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kagyu system refers to those who manifest clear light mind by relying on the methods for penetrating vital points of the external and internal body as those who progress through graded stages of methods. Such practitioners manifest clear light mind by progressing through stages. Those with sharp faculties, however, may be practitioners for whom everything happens at once. The Nyingma tradition of dzogchen also distinguishes between these two types of practitioners. Those who manifest rigpa, pure awareness, by training through stages involving various practices with the energy-winds, tummo, and so forth are those who progress through graded stages, while those for whom everything happens at once achieve the same by relying solely on meditation on a nonconceptual state of mental consciousness without the practices of the energy channels and energy-winds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to one Kagyu text, the method of practice of those for whom everything happens at once is powerful medicine. But it is deadly poison for those who progress through graded stages. In other words, the method of practice of meditating solely on the nonconceptual state of the mind is suited only for those of sharpest faculties. For those who are not of their level, such practice brings only harm, no benefit. For them the medicine acts like a poison.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kaydrub Norzang-gyatso, in ''A Lamp for Clarifying Mahamudra to Establish the Single Intention of the Kagyu and Gelug Traditions'', has explained that those for whom everything happens at once are persons who have trained extensively through stages either in previous lives or earlier in this life. As a result, meditation on the nonconceptual state of the mind, without need to rely on any further meditation on penetrating vital points of the vajra-body, alone causes clear light mind to manifest so that everything happens at once. Such meditation does this by acting as a circumstance for triggering the ripening of potentials built up from previous practice with energy-winds and so forth, so that they automatically enter, abide and dissolve in the central energy-channel. If a practitioner has not built up these potentials, then no matter how intensively he or she may focus in a nonconceptual state of mind, this person is unable to manifest clear light mind or pure awareness. They lack sufficient causes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4769">A '''project anatomy''' (also '''integration anatomy or organic integration plan''') is a tool for integration planning that visualizes dependencies between work items in development projects. It is mainly used in [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental development]] and [[Integration Driven Development]] projects.

The project anatomy has evolved from the [[system anatomy]] and in its purest form the work items (called ''work packages'') reflect the development of system capabilities. Often a more pragmatic approach is taken, though, where work packages may contain other items with important dependencies as well, e.g. HW deliveries for embedded systems.

&lt;big&gt;'''Benefits:'''&lt;/big&gt; 
* Simple
* Easy to grasp view of what to do, what is done and the dependencies between work packages
* Collaborative
* Common view for developers, project managers and sponsors
* Helps in finding and managing risks and delays
* Can be used to manage dependencies between teams and sprints in large [[Agile software development|agile development]] projects

&lt;big&gt;'''Limitations:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* Can include, but not manage, lead time aspects
* Can include, but not manage, resource aspects

== History ==
History of [[system anatomy|system anatomies]]
Project anatomies have evolved from system anatomies, mainly at Ericsson, since the late 1990s. Both the terminology and the methodology have differed between organizations and the difference between "system anatomy", "project anatomy", "delta anatomy" and "integration anatomy" is sometimes diffuse or non-existent. In 2004 FindOut Technologies presented a SW tool (Paipe) for managing anatomies with more properties. The company has, since then, worked to establish the term Project Anatomy.

== Example ==
The project anatomy below is an example showing the work packages needed to develop a simple issue management system. 

Work packages with many dependencies are called spiders and indicate a risk. The risk may be managed by splitting the work package or by moving dependants of it to later shipments (increments).

The colors indicate the current status of work packages, where green means “on track”, yellow means “at risk” and red means “off track”. Blue work packages are done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34351">'''Romanesque Revival architecture''', '''Norman Revival architecture''' or '''Neo-Norman''' styles of building were inspired by the [[Romanesque Architecture]] of the 11th and 12th centuries AD.
[[File:WiltonChurch.jpg|thumb|300px|Church of SS Mary and Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, by TH Wyatt, 1841–4]]
In the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and part of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicist or Historismus]] styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as [[Rundbogenstil]] or round arched style.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=54–56}} In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.
[[File:Aubourn Church - geograph.org.uk - 863629.jpg|thumb|250px|Aubourn Church, Lincolnshire, 1862–3]]

== The origins of the Romanesque Revival or Norman Revival in the United Kingdom ==
[[File:St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door 1570]]
[[File:North Scarle, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|150px|North Scarle, Lincolnshire]] 
The development of the ''Norman'' revival style or ''Neo-Norman'' took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with [[Inigo Jones]]‘s [[Window|re-fenestration]] of the White Tower of the [[Tower of London]] in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by [[Hugh May]] for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building,&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=587}}

[[File:St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - geograph.org.uk - 419918.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - by John Vardy, 1745]]

In the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being [[Saxon]] rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include [[Shirburn Castle]] in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and [[Enmore Castle]] in Somerset. At [[Allerton Mauleverer]] in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a ''proto-Neo-Norman''. While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam]] nave roof. The architect is thought to have been [[John Vardy]] surveyor to the Office of Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leach|Pevsner|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|thumb|225px|Tickencote Church 1792 Early example of church Romanesque revival]]
A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for the conservation and rebuilding of [[St Peter's Church, Tickencote]] in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate [[chancel]] arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The [[nave]] was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian)
 |year=1935 |chapter=Tickencote |title=A History of the County of Rutland |volume=II |series=[[Victoria County History]] |place=London |publisher=St Catherine Press |pages=275–281 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/rutland/vol2/pp275-281 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840’s under architectects such as [[Thomas Penson]] and [[Benjamin Ferrey]]. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. [[File:Front entrance to Eastnor Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1468597.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, combining Romanesque and Gothic features]] In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at [[Inverary]], started in 1744, and castles by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Culzean]] (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and [[Seton Palace]] (1792). In England [[James Wyatt]] used round arched windows at [[Sandleford Priory]], Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild [[Arundel Castle]], while [[Eastnor Castle]] in Herefordshire was built by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1981 |title=The Norman Revival in British Architecture 1790–1870}} PhD Thesis, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Development of ''Archaeologically Correct'' Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of the ''archaeological correctness'' was popularised by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] in his many writings and he was using the term by 1950 in his Broadcast Talks (page 190) to describe architecture and designs based closely on illustrations of actual buildings or objects.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8eaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Pevsner+archaeologically+correct&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkM10Y0f1I&amp;sig=gKtc0zp0nG3E71Al_PHmcJZFk5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKPAvJfKAhXIYQ4KHR3hCJwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pevsner%20archaeologically%20correct&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[File:GosfordCastle.jpg|thumb|left|GosfordCastle, Armagh by Thomas Hopper]] 
[[File:Penrhyn Castle - geograph.org.uk - 206536.jpg|thumb|Penrhyn Castle - by Thomas Hopper 1820–37]]
It was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in ''Archaeologia'' (1832–33), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickman |first=Thomas |title=` |journal=Archaeologia |volume=XXV |publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]] |pages=159–185}} esp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1991 |chapter=Penrhryn and the Norman Revival |series=National Trust Guide |title=Penrhryn Castle, Gwynedd |place= |publisher=National Trust |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Architecture and the Romanesque Revival==
[[File:Church of St Agatha, Llanymynech 02.jpg|thumb|left|St Agatha, [[Llanymynech]]. Romanesque Tower by Penson 1845]]
[[File:Rhosllanerchrugog Church.jpeg|thumb|Rhosllanerchrugog Church, 1852]]
[[File:Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar.JPG|thumb|Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar]]
However, the ''Norman Revival'' did catch on for church architecture. It was [[Thomas Penson]], a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German [[Brick Gothic]]. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]], Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are [[Christ Church, Welshpool]], 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|p=13}} Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], Wrexham of 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=E |series=The Buildings of Wales |title=Clwyd |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |page=264 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Losh and Wreay Church===
A most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was [[St Mary's Church, Wreay|St Mary’s Church at Wreay]], near Carlisle.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/losh/1.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=St Mary's Church, Wreay, by Sarah Losh (1785–1853) |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed by [[Sarah Losh]] and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read [[Thomas Hope (architect)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''Historical Study of Architecture'' (1815), which uses the term ''Lombardic'' for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an ''unpolished mode of building'' that ''most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |year=2012 |title=The Pinecone: the Story of Sara Losh |place=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0571269501 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, while the arcading of the [[apse]] certainly has a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] feel to it.&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt;

==Other Early Victorian Architects working in the Romanesque revival style==
The early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas [[high church]]es and [[Anglo-Catholic]], which were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]]; low churches and [[Broad church]]es of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|pages=170–73|title=The Gothic Revival|edition=3rd|year=1962
|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn= 0719502330}}, and also Cambridge Camden Society (1841),''A Few Words to Church-builders''[https://archive.org/details/fewwordstochurch00camb].&lt;/ref&gt; The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.

===Edmund Sharpe===
Another architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was [[Edmund Sharpe]], who set up his practice at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of [[William Whewell]] and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]].

They ''turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged''. The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements [[St Mary's Church, Conistone]] in [[Wharfedale]] (1846); and [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Scotforth]] in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth]], was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a ''strange building'' and ''an anachronism, almost beyond belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1969 |title=Lancashire |volume=2 The Rural North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=29, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, F.

===Benjamin Ferrey===
[[File:East Grafton - St Nicholas Church - geograph.org.uk - 1448466.jpg|thumb|left|East Grafton - St Nicholas Church, 1842–44]]
[[File:Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great - geograph.org.uk - 223562.jpg|thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844–46]] The work of [[Benjamin Ferrey]] can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at [[East Grafton]] in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Wiltshire Community History|title=Church of St. Nicholas, East Grafton|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getchurch.php?id=1184|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque [[Lych gate]].

A more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of [[Monreale]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweddle |first=Marilyn |title=A Historical Guide to the Church of St James the Great |place=Morpeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the [[portico]] at the cathedral at [[Monreale]], but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in [[Melplash]] in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.

===William Perkin of Leeds===
St Michael and All Angels [[Barton le Street]], North Yorkshire.
This church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by [[Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram|Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1966 |title=Yorkshire: the North Riding |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071029-9 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE| num=1148993 |desc=Church of St Michael |grade=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapel Architecture===

[[File:Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury - geograph.org.uk - 195730.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury]]

In the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for [[Dissenting]] chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to [[Anglican]] churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the [[Baptists]]. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of [[Italianate]] Romanesque as seen at the [[Potters Bar|Potter's Bar]] Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbbc.org.uk/home Potters Bar Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist Church in Brown Street [[Salisbury]] of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more ''archaeologically correct'' in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects [[Michael Drury|Drury and Mortimer]], the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the [[castellated]] Gothic style.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=521–2}}

[[File:Grimsby Synagogue - geograph.org.uk - 141647.jpg|thumb|Grimsby Synagogue]]

===Synagogues===
The Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. 
One of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at [[Grimsby]] in Lincolnshire.

===Later Romanesque Revival Churches in Scotland===

[[File:West Kirk (geograph 1866764).jpg|thumb|West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr, by William Gale 1844–45]] 
The earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.
In Scotland the [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]]s occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. 
[[St Conan’s Kirk]] Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1082 |title=St Conan's Kirk |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another church is Cranshaws in [[Berwickshire]]. Here the 1739 church was rebuilt in 1899 by architect George Fortune in Romanesque Revival style.

==Sir Alfred Waterhouse and developed Romanesque Architecture==

[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London]]
Interest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Natural History Museum]] in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=70–77}} It was built in shades of buff coloured [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the [[Wrexham]] and [[Ruabon]] area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.

[[File:Silver Street, Lincoln.jpg|160px|thumb|42 Silver Street, Lincoln]]
Waterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by [[William Watkins (architect)|William Watkins]], a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red [[Ruabon]] terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=509}} An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln. This uses artificial stone for Romanesque columns and arches to embellish the frontage. &lt;ref&gt;Survey of Lincoln, City Building Applications no. 413- 04/03/1873&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Aidans Font Leeds.jpg|thumb|Font at St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[File:St Aidans 2754.jpg|thumb|left|St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[St Aidan's Church, Leeds]] is a massive [[basilica]] church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the [[Corbel table]] or moulded [[stringcourse]] below the eaves was based on that of [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s in the Byzantine style.{{sfn|Leach|Pevsner|2009|pp=525–7}}

===20th Century===

[[File:St Francis' Church, Linden Road, Bournville - geograph.org.uk - 315175.jpg|thumb|St Francis' Church, Linden Road, Bournville]]
In the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine revival style]], which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. 
Churches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.

An even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate

The casket survived all the confiscations after the collapses of the Polish national uprisings, because it had been moved to [[Kraków]].

When [[World War II]] broke out, it was transported together with the rich collection of the [[Czartoryski Museum]] to [[Sieniawa]] and hidden in a repository, in a palace outbuilding, which was later bricked up. However, the German owner of a mill who worked for the [[Czartoryski family]] betrayed the hiding place to ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' soldiers, who entered [[Sieniawa]] on 14 September 1939.&lt;ref name="priceless_ookz" /&gt; The soldiers broke into the palace and plundered the collection. They robbed the Royal Casket and distributed its contents among themselves.&lt;ref name="inist_cat" /&gt;

{{Network science}}
A '''telecommunications network''' is a collection of terminal nodes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Link (telecommunications)|links]]  are connected so as to enable [[telecommunication]] between the terminals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Design Elements - Telecommunication networks|url=https://conceptdraw.com/a915c3/preview--Design%20Elements%20-%20Telecommunication%20networks
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] links connect the nodes together. The nodes use circuit switching, message switching or packet switching to pass the signal through the correct links and nodes to reach the correct destination terminal.

Each terminal in the network usually has a unique [[network address|address]] so messages or connections can be routed to the correct recipients. The collection of addresses in the network is called the [[Address space layout randomization|address space]].

Examples of telecommunications networks are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunication Network - Types of Telecommunication Networks|url=http://www.wifinotes.com/computer-networks/telecommunication-network.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[computer network]]s
* the [[Internet]]
* the [[telephone network]]
* the global [[Telex]] network
* the aeronautical [[ACARS]] network

== Benefits of telecommunications and networking ==


Telecommunications facilitates interaction and information transfer over large distances. Businesses use telecommunications to expand and grow their networks. With Internet, computer, and telephone networks, businesses can allocate their resources efficiently. These core types of networks will be discussed below:

Computer network: a computer network consists of computers and devices connected to one another. Information can be transferred from one device to the next. For example, an office filled with computers can share files together on each separate device. Computer networks can range from a [[local area network (LAN)]] to a [[Wide area network|wide area network (WAN)]]. The difference between the types of networks is the size. These types of computer networks work at certain speeds, also known as broadband. The Internet network connects computers worldwide.

Internet network: access to the network allows users to use many resources. Over time the Internet network will replace books. This will enable users to discover information almost instantly and apply concepts to different situations. The Internet can be used for recreational, governmental, educational, and other purposes. Businesses in particular use the Internet network for research or to service customers and clients.

Telephone network: the telephone network connects people to one another. This network can be used in a variety of ways. Many businesses use the telephone network to route calls and/or service their customers. Some businesses use a telephone network on a greater scale through a private branch exchange. It is a system where a specific business focuses on routing and servicing calls for another business. Majority of the time, the telephone network is used around the world for recreational purposes.

== Network structure ==
In general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so called because they can be thought of as being, and often are, separate [[overlay network]]s):

* The [[data plane]] (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network's users' traffic, the actual payload.
* The [[control plane]] carries control information (also known as [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signaling]]).
* The [[management plane]] carries the operations and administration traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.

== Example: the TCP/IP data network ==
The data network is used extensively throughout the world to connect individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The [[Internet]]&lt;ref name="gorry_MAN" /&gt; is the best example of many data networks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;from different organizations all operating under a single address space.

Terminals attached to [[TCP/IP port number|TCP/IP]] networks are addressed using [[IP address management|IP addresses]]. There are different types of IP address, but the most common is [[IP Version 4]]. Each unique address consists of 4 integers between 0 and 255, usually separated by dots when written down, e.g. 82.131.34.56.

TCP/IP are the fundamental protocols that provide the control and routing of messages across the data network.  There are many different network structures that TCP/IP can be used across to efficiently route messages, for example:
* [[wide area network]]s (WAN)
* [[metropolitan area network]]s (MAN)
* [[local area network]]s (LAN)
* [[Internet area network]]s (IAN)
* [[campus area network]]s (CAN)
* [[Virtual private network|virtual private networks]] (VPN)

There are three features that differentiate MANs from LANs or WANs:

# The area of the network size is between LANs and WANs. The MAN will have a physical area between 5 and 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# MANs do not generally belong to a single organization. The equipment that interconnects the network, the links, and the MAN itself are often owned by an association or a network provider that provides or leases the service to others.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# A MAN is a means for sharing resources at high speeds within the network. It often provide connections to WAN networks for access to resources outside the scope of the MAN.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/intro-pages/man.html |title=Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) |publisher=Erg.abdn.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datacenter networks also rely highly on TCP/IP for communication across machines. They connect thousands of servers, are designed to be highly robust, provide low latency that is typically up to hundreds of microseconds, and high bandwidth. Datacenter network topology plays a significant role in determining the level of failure resiliency, ease of incremental expansion, communication bandwidth and latency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noormohammadpour|first1=Mohammad|last2=Raghavendra|first2=Cauligi|title=Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs|journal=Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials, IEEE|date=28 July 2018|volume=20|issue=2|page=1492-1525|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8207422/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomislav Volek''', is a Czech musicologist who is best known for his research on the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

==Biography==
Spending much of his career in Prague, Volek made a virtue of necessity by exploring the musical life of eighteenth-century Bohemia, with particular emphasis on Mozart’s activities in Prague. Meticulous archival research combined with a willingness to advance daring new hypotheses led to a series of pathbreaking articles, one of which, ''“Über den Ursprung von Mozarts Oper [[La clemenza di Tito]]”'' (''Mozart-Jahrbuch'', 1959), contributed to a fundamental reassessment of one of Mozart’s late operas, although some of his theories, especially the claim that Mozart began work on the opera much earlier than the summer of 1791, have been thoroughy refuted in English-language musicological literature.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of this literature, see Daniel E. Freeman, ''Mozart in Prague'' (2013), pp. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His work on ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and its Bohemian context is also of crucial importance, as is his edition of Mozart documents, ''“The Mozartiana of Czech and Moravian Archives”'' (Prague, 1991).

Volek is President of the Czech Mozart Society and a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12976">'''Toxicogenomics''' is a subdiscipline of [[pharmacology]] that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about [[gene]] and [[protein]] activity within a particular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of an [[organism]] in response to exposure to [[toxin|toxic substances]]. Toxicogenomics combines [[toxicology]] with [[genomics]] or other high-throughput molecular profiling technologies such as [[transcriptomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=The National Academies Press|title= Communicating Toxicogenomics Information to Nonexperts: A Workshop Summary |year=2005|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11179&amp;page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications | veditors = Hamadeh HK, Afshari CA | year = 2004 | publisher = Wiley-Liss | location  =Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 0-471-43417-5 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Omenn GS | title = Book Review: Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | volume = 112 | issue = 16 | pages = A962 | date  =November 2004 | pmc = 1247673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicogenomics endeavors to elucidate the molecular mechanisms evolved in the expression of toxicity, and to derive molecular expression patterns (i.e., molecular [[biomarker]]s) that predict toxicity or the genetic susceptibility to it.

In pharmaceutical research, toxicogenomics is defined as the study of the structure and function of the [[genome]] as it responds to adverse xenobiotic exposure. It is the toxicological subdiscipline of [[pharmacogenomics]], which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] maps, [[haplotype]] markers, and alterations in [[gene expression]] that might correlate with drug responses.&lt;ref name="pmid15340386"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesko LJ, Woodcock J | title = Translation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics: a regulatory perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

The term is still not universally accepted, and others have offered alternative terms such as ''chemogenomics'' to describe essentially the same field of study.&lt;ref name="pmid15952870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fielden MR, Pearson C, Brennan R, Kolaja KL | title = Preclinical drug safety analysis by chemogenomic profiling in the liver | journal = American Journal of Pharmacogenomics : Genomics-related Research in Drug Development and Clinical Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952870 | doi = 10.2165/00129785-200505030-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and complexity of the data (in volume and variability) demands highly developed processes of automated handling and storage. The analysis usually involves a wide array of [[bioinformatics]] and [[statistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattes WB, Pettit SD, Sansone SA, Bushel PR, Waters MD | title = Database development in toxicogenomics: issues and efforts | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 495–505 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15033600 | pmc = 1241904 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.6697 | url = http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171519/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | archivedate = 2008-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; often including [[statistical classification]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H, Gmuender H, Bandenburg A, Ahr HJ | title = Prediction of a carcinogenic potential of rat hepatocarcinogens using toxicogenomics analysis of short-term in vivo studies | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 637 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–39 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17689568 | doi = 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.06.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|development]], toxicogenomics is used to study possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse]] (i.e. [[toxic]]) effects of pharmaceutical [[drug]]s in defined [[model organism|model systems]] in order to draw conclusions on the toxic risk to patients or the environment. Both the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) currently preclude basing regulatory decision-making on genomics data alone. However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data on a case-by-case basis for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicological test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corvi R, Ahr HJ, Albertini S, Blakey DH, Clerici L, Coecke S, Douglas GR, Gribaldo L, Groten JP, Haase B, Hamernik K, Hartung T, Inoue T, Indans I, Maurici D, Orphanides G, Rembges D, Sansone SA, Snape JR, Toda E, Tong W, van Delft JH, Weis B, Schechtman LM | title = Meeting report: Validation of toxicogenomics-based test systems: ECVAM-ICCVAM/NICEATM considerations for regulatory use | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16507466 | pmc = 1392237 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8247 | url = http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017084247/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | archivedate = 2008-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''triangle fan''' is a primitive in 3D [[computer graphics]] that saves on storage and processing time. It describes a set of connected triangles '''that share one central vertex''' (unlike the [[triangle strip]] that connects the next vertex point to the last two used vertices to form a triangle). If N is the number of triangles in the fan, the number of vertices describing it is N+2. This is a considerable improvement over the 3N vertices that are necessary to describe the triangles separately. The [[graphics pipeline]] can take advantage by only performing the viewing transformations and lighting calculations once per vertex. Triangle fans are deprecated in Direct3D10 and later.&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc308047(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[convex polygon]] may be triangulated as a single fan, by arbitrarily selecting any point inside it as the center.

'''Vermiform''' describes something shaped like a [[worm]]. The expression is often employed in [[biology]] and [[anatomy]] to describe more or less tubular or cylindrical, usually soft body parts or animals. The word root is [[Latin]], ''vermes''-worms and ''formes''-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glare|first=edited by P.G.W.|title=[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-864224-5|edition=Combined ed., repr. with corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A well known example is the [[vermiform appendix]], a small, blind section of the gut in humans and a number of other [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith H. F., Fisher R. E., Everett M. L., Thomas A. D., Bollinger, R. R., Parker W. | year = 2009 | title = Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 1984–1999 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x | pmid=19678866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Soft-bodied organisms|soft-bodied]] animal [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] are typically described as vermiform. The more well known one are undoubtedly the [[Annelida|annelids]] (earthworm and relatives) and the [[Nematoda|roundworms]] (a very common, mainly parasitic group), but a number of less well known phyla answer to the same description. Examples range from the minute parasitic [[mesozoa]]ns to the larger bodied free-living phyla like [[Nemertea|ribbon worms]], [[Nemertea|peanut worms]] and [[Priapulida|priapulids]].

'''World Book Day''' is a charity event held annually in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on the first Thursday in March. It is the local manifestation of ''[[World Book and Copyright Day]]'' (also known as ''International Day of the Book'' or ''World Book Days'') organized by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. On World Book Day, every child in full-time education in the UK is given a voucher to be spent on books.

The Day was first celebrated in 1995 in the United Kingdom. The original, global [[World Book Day]] event is generally observed on 23 April - it was changed in the UK to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with [[St George's Day]]. Conversely, a separate event [http://www.worldbooknight.org/ World Book Night] organized by independent charity [[The Reading Agency]] is held on 23 April.

==History==
The United Kingdom's own version of World Book Day began in 1998, launched by [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] at the [[Globe Theatre]] in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Several million schoolchildren in the UK were given a special £1 World Book Day Book Token (€1.50 in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) which could be redeemed against any book in any UK bookshop. A specially created WBD anthology priced at £1 (€1.50 in Ireland) was also published. All World Book Day [[point of sale]] and the £1 book carried the special World Book Day logo to help unify the initiative through all outlets.

Since then, World Book Day UK has followed a similar pattern, gradually growing each year to encompass more initiatives, such as ''Spread The Word'', ''[[Quick Reads Initiative]]'' and ''Books for Hospitals''. Every year, the number of children receiving a World Book Day Book Token has increased.

In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 [[List of World Book Day Books|books]] were published, covering a wider age-range.  Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

In 2006, World Book Day began its support of and association with the ''Quick Reads''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/vitallink/Quickreads.html#background Quick Reads website]&lt;/ref&gt; initiative for adult emergent readers.

In 2007, World Book Day celebrated its 10th anniversary with the publication of 10 £1 books. Since then every child in full-time education in the UK and Ireland is entitled to receive a £1 World Book day Book token every year. They can swap their WBD token for one of specially-produced [[List of World Book Day Books|£1 WBD books]] or they can get £1 off a full-price book or audio book priced £2.99 or more.

==Administration==
World Book Day is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1079257  Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not raise funds for itself but does support [http://www.bookaid.org Book Aid International]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookaid.org/cms.cgi/site/  Book Aid International website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Readathon as its nominated charities, encouraging schools to hold special fundraising events for children less fortunate than themselves. World Book Day is not funded by the British Government although the Quick Reads element does receive support from ACE, DIUS and NIACE. The funding for World Book Day activities comes principally from the major sponsor, National Book Tokens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/index.asp?m=32&amp;c=1157  National Book Tokens website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK book trade (publishers and booksellers).
