      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4607">'''Alberto Alén Pérez''' (1948 in Havana&amp;nbsp;– 14 October 2004) was a [[Cuba]]n [[musicologist]] and [[cellist]].

==Academic formation==

Alén studied [[violoncello]] with Professor Fabio Landa at Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory in [[Marianao]], [[Havana]], and at the Amadeo Roldán Conservatory in the same city.&lt;ref name="Orovio"&gt;{{cite book|author=Orovio, Helio|title= Cuban Music from A to Z|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780822332121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied psychology at the [[Havana University]] &lt;ref name="Diagnosticar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alén Pérez, Alberto|title=Diagnosticar&gt;Diagnosticar la musicalidad|url= http://www.casa.cult.cu/premios/musicologia/diagnosticar.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and musicology in the [[Instituto Superior de Arte|Higher Institute of Art]] (ISA) where he graduated in 1982.&lt;ref name="Orovio"/&gt;

==Biography==

As a cellist, Alén worked in several orchestras such as the Orquesta Popular de Conciertos founded by Maestro Alfredo Diez Nieto &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gell, Leonardo|title= Alfredo Diez Nieto y la Orquesta Popular de Conciertos|url= http://www.cmbfradio.cu/articulo.php?art=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Orchestra of the Grand Theater of Havana.  He also performed in other orchestras affiliated to the Cuban Radio and Television Network.&lt;ref name="Orovio"/&gt; Alén taught at the Higher Institute of Art (ISA) and worked as researcher at the Center for Research and Development of Cuban Music. He worked also as an adviser for musical programs in Cuban Television. Alberto Alén gave classes and lectures in Cuba, Mexico and [[Algeria]]. His works on musicology include: ''Perspectivas de la investigación musical actual'' (1976), ''La forma de las formas musicales'' (1978) and ''La génesis del espacio musical'' (1986). Also in 1986, Alén received the prestigious [[Casa de Las Américas Prize]] on the musicology category for his book: ''Diagnosticar la musicalidad''.

==Work==

Although Alén's work remains relatively unknown to the general public, it actually represents a relevant contribution to musicology. According to [[Eugene Chadbourne]], “Musicology students might consider making Spanish their Language Major simply to study the works of Alberto Alén... by any standards Alen's most challenging work has been a series of five books written and published between 1976 and 1986”.&lt;ref name="Chadbourne"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chadbourne, Eugene|title= Alberto Alén, Biography|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alberto-alen-mn0002033019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early work: ''La forma de las formas musicales (The form of musical forms)'', is for the musicological science what the Bauhaus investigations and experimentations represented for the modern development of visual arts and design. In this article, Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to the traditional musical forms analysis. In it he explains, referring to the perception of musical structures: “The visual forms (as well as the audition and tactile forms) are something different from a succession or sum of particular sensations. They are something else. The complex of stimulations that arrive to the retina (or to the Organ of Corti in the case of audition) generate, at a cortical level, – so affirms Pavlov- “functional systems that act integrally as in the case of an elemental conditioned reflex’, where all particular contents of different stimulations is transcended when reflecting their multiple reciprocal relationships, that are continuously exerting influence between each other (González, 1960: 72; Rubinstein, 1967:274).&lt;ref&gt;Alén, Alberto. La forma de las formas musicales. Casa de las Américas. Boletín de Música No. 72. Pag. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

“''Diagnosticar la Musicalidad'', the latest of Alen's tomes, continues an in-depth study of practical musical phenomena that rivals the writings of the German composer and musicologist [[Paul Hindemith]]”&lt;ref name="Chadbourne"/&gt;... states Eugene Chadbuorne in reference to this particular work from Alberto Alén. In Diagnosticar la Musicalidad, the author presents to the general public the results of an extensive investigation, conducted between 1976 and 1983 with the purpose to improve the musical tests performed in Cuban schools to select new music students.&lt;ref name="Diagnosticar"/&gt;

'''Alderley Park''' was a country house in a park of the same name at [[Nether Alderley]], Cheshire, England, between Macclesfield and Knutsford. It was purchased by Bruntwood in 2014.  The site has an international reputation as a home for bio and life sciences. 

The house was constructed in brick with a stone facade for the [[John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley|7th Baronet Stanley]]. Building started in 1818 on a site in the south of the park. The new house grew to a size of sixty bedrooms and six entertaining rooms, of which only one room, with its oak panelling and coats of arms intact, remains. Behind the house a walled garden and a water garden were created and the mill pond enlarged. In 1931, however, the house was severely damaged by fire and left empty for nearly twenty years until converted in 1950 by the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] chemical group to serve as the headquarters of their new pharmaceutical division. The gardens and some outbuildings have been preserved and many thousands of trees planted.

==History==
The manor of Over Alderley came into the Stanley family when heiress Elizabeth Weever married John Stanley, a brother of the Earl of Derby. In the 1580s John Stanley's descendant, Thomas Stanley, built a [[Alderley Old Hall|mansion house]] on a moated site near the [[Nether Alderley Mill|mill]] at Nether Alderley. Thomas died in 1591.

The adjacent manor of Nether Alderley had been confiscated by the crown in 1508 from the estate of [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] after his conviction and execution for supporting [[Perkin Warbeck]]. It was sold in 1556 to Sir Edward Fitton of Gawsworth who sold it on for £2000 to Thomas Stanley, jnr in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/hs1864/alderley.htm| title = Stanley of Alderley|accessdate = 2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was knighted by King James in 1603. The Stanley family subsequently occupied the hall for around two hundred years until it was severely damaged by fire in 1779; part of the old hall survives, dating from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139591|desc=The Old Hall|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th Baronet then commissioned a new hall to be constructed in 1818, in the south of the estate on a site then occupied by Park House.

The new hall was subsequently occupied by further generations of the Stanley family until 1931, when it too was damaged by fire during the occupation of [[Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley]] and had to be partially demolished and left unoccupied. The sixth Lord's finances had suffered from the effects of two expensive divorces, gambling losses and death duties and in 1938 he decided to sell the estate piecemeal, involving the disposal of 77 farms and 166 houses. No offers were received for the hall itself and it stood empty for nearly twenty years.

==Business use==
In 1950 the dilapidated hall and {{Convert|350|acre}} of surrounding parkland were purchased, with planning permission to develop, by ICI Pharmaceuticals for £55,000. Work began in 1957 on a site by Radnor Mere (the enlarged mill pond) to provide office and laboratory facilities, initially for ICI and latterly for AstraZeneca, and which came to house some 3,500 staff. It became a global lead centre for cancer research and a number of anti-cancer treatments were developed at the site including [[Nolvadex]], [[Zoladex]], [[Casodex]], [[Arimidex]] and [[Iressa]].

Work on the latest Alderley Hall began in 1963, and incorporates a surviving part of the previous building. Originally the ballroom, this part is now named the [[James Black (pharmacologist)|Sir James Black]] Conference Centre in honour of the discoverer of [[beta-blocker]]s. The gardens and the woodlands have been restored and the nearby Grade II listed Home Farm buildings preserved. The latter includes coach-houses, cottages and barns of hand-made English orange brick and a six-sided columbarium or dovecote.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139596|desc=Training Centre and Stores at Alderley Park|access-date=20 August 2017|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1221289|desc=Dovecote at Alderley Park|access-date=20 August 2017|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, AstraZeneca announced plans to cease R&amp;D work at Alderley Park. A total of 1,600 jobs were to be relocated over three years, mainly to [[Cambridge]], but the company planned to continue non-R&amp;D work at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21833207 BBC News: AstraZeneca axes 700 jobs in Cambridge move] (accessed 19 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Alderley Park was purchased by Manchester Science Parks – a partnership between Manchester's academic centres and local councils, and investment company [[Bruntwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/alderley_park_will_remain_flagship_bioscience_location_552479|title=Alderley Park 'will remain flagship bioscience location'|last=|first=|date=12 March 2014|website=PMLive|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redevelopment ==
In February 2016, planning consent was granted for a £160m masterplan to re-develop the Park which will include significant investment into re-purposing the bioscience campus to one of multiple occupancy, up to 275 homes, a farm shop, village shop, gastropub and new leisure facilities.  Construction of the first two phases of houses by PH Homes and PJ Livesey commenced in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PH's Alderley Park homes start at £735k|url=https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/phs-alderley-park-homes-start-at-735k/|website=Place North West|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ADAM Architecture|Robert Adam]], one of the architects for PH Homes' Alderley Park development, was awarded the 2017 [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]], the highest value architecture award in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architect For Alderley Park Wins Major Prize|url=https://www.alderleypark.co.uk/news/2017/8/8/architect-for-alderley-park-scheme-robert-adam-receives-major-architectural-prize/|website=Alderley Park|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, over 150 companies are based at Alderley Park, including the Medicines Discovery [[Catapult centres|Catapult]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://md.catapult.org.uk/contact-us/|title=Contact Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicines Discovery Catapult|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AMR Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrcentre.com/|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=www.amrcentre.com|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''antagonism''' is a phenomenon wherein two or more agents in combination have an overall effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects.

The word is most commonly used in this context in [[biochemistry]] and [[toxicology]]: interference in the physiological action of a chemical substance by another having a similar structure. For instance, a [[receptor antagonist]] is an agent that reduces the response that a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] produces when the receptor antagonist binds to a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. An example of this is the [[interleukin-1]] receptor antagonist. The opposite of antagonism is [[synergy]]. It is a negative type of synergism.

Experiments with different combinations show that binary mixtures of [[natural phenol|phenol]]ics can lead to either a [[synergy|synergetic]] [[antioxidant effect of natural phenols|antioxidant effect]] or to an antagonistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11746-003-0812-z|title=Antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidation: Synergistic and antagonistic effects|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1007|year=2003|last1=Peyrat-Maillard|first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Asian studies''', a term used usually in [[North America]] for [[Oriental studies]] and is concerned with the  [[Asia]]n people, their cultures, languages, history and politics. Within the Asian sphere, Asian studies combines aspects of [[sociology]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]] and many other disciplines to study political, cultural and economic phenomena in Asian traditional and contemporary societies. Asian studies forms a field of [[post-graduate study]] in many universities.

It is a branch of [[area studies]], and many Western universities combine Asian and [[African studies]] in a single faculty or institute, like [[SOAS]] in London.  It is often combined with [[Islamic studies]] in a similar way.  The history of the discipline in the West is covered under [[Oriental studies]].

The etymological meaning of the word [[:es:Audiovisualogía|audiovisualogy]] is linked, on the one hand, with the term [[audiovisual]], referring to the means jointly related to the view and the hearing and, on the other hand, to the suffix [[-logy|logy]], that refers to [[logos]], and that in Greek means ''treaty, knowledge''. Therefore, '''audiovisualogy''' must be understood as a study of the audiovisual media that, due to its broad meaning, could be related to either the cinema, the television or any other art.

It is also feasible to understand it as the means and art that combine fixed projected images (slides or digital support) in its ''montage'', accompanied by sounds of a different nature, therefore meaning a language different from the film, since it does not use the image in motion.

Although it was known in France as [[diaporama]] (slideshow)&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4951590 The reinvention of the slideshow as photographic formula.]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950, its current name of audiovisual art is truly accepted in many fields, such as in some institutions in the United Kingdom, like photo clubs and others with a high artistic level, as the ''Royal Photography Society'', among others.

From this perspective, it is also possible to develop a theory about the audiovisual art, thus defining it as the language that combines still images (pictures with sound), in a [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that by its condition is displayed as in the cinema, in a room designed for that purpose.

== Historical background ==
The audiovisual art constitutes a means of expression which came before the cinema. In fact, projections of still images are really old. In 1660, [[Athanasius Kircher]] invented one of the first ''magic lanterns'' that worked as a real projector, which had a great diffusion afterwards.

Moreover, from another point of view, the prehistoric man could be considered as the first audiovisual spectator of humanity, who contemplated the static skies and the landscape in amazement, along with the sounds of nature coming from the animals and the storms. The cave paintings inside the caves ended up representing the first screen of the humanity in the dark inside of a venue.

Much later, [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]] were the first creators of the panoramas, i.e., large lounges with painted curtains, on which the light was projected in a zenith shape to give the illusion of reality. In 1822, the [[diorama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_2.htm Daguerre and his Diorama in the 1830s: some financial announcements.]&lt;/ref&gt; built by both of them, became the ultimate expression of the current audiovisual art, since it modified the panorama by the layout of several overlapped curtains with themes of nature, which produced a changing effect when moving from one image to another by the dissolve effect, all this accompanied by sounds with a principle of action, development and final parts.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Farjat. ''Audiovisualogy. The Audiovisual as Art and Mean of Communication'' [[:es:Audiovisualogía|Audiovisualogía]]. El audiovisual como arte y medio de comunicación. Colección de arte y memoria audiovisual. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The audiovisual concept as an art ==
One of the main foundations that defines this means as an art is its connection to [[painting]]. If the conditions are given like that, and the accompanying sound represents an expression which is also aesthetic, the attitude of contemplation separates the audiovisual concept from the physical world of the movement in the cinema and other means.

The attitude of contemplation of the fine arts necessarily implies a spiritualization of the emotions, where the classic spirit prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Farjat. Audiovisual Theory. ''Teoría Audiovisual. Colección de Arte y Memoria Audiovisual''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Leirens had already expressed that there are two ways to represent time. One is by representing it as it is, and the other one means exceeding it. He stated that the second way belongs precisely to the poetic creation.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Leirens. Le Cinema Et Le Temps Paperback – 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenio Montes, when writing its ''Elementos of Filmología'' [Film-making Elements], announced that the calling of the classic period consisted of the stillness, since only things that are quiet consisted of something. On the contrary, when they moved, they already seemed inconsistent to the classic period. Because of this, the ancient spirit culminates in the sculptural attitude of the best gesture, set under a kind of eternity. That is what makes the difference with the cinema, which culminates its expression in the art of movement.

Another reason that justifies the audiovisual concept as an art is the use of the [[music]] that, represented accordingly with the still images, creates a new aesthetic expression by setting a different path, perhaps fairly unexplored, further accentuating the attitude of contemplation.

== The audiovisual montage ==
Considering these principles, the audiovisual montage may refer to two aspects: the [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] one, which alludes to the aesthetic connection of a shot with the next one, thus obtaining different forms, such as the analogy, the contrast and others. The other aspect is the extrinsic montage, which is the method of association point between a shot and the next one and that may be, for example, by a cut or by the so-called dissolve effect or lap dissolve between a still image and the one after it.

Like in the cinema, the intrinsic montage methods are very varied and represent a substantial element in the analysis of the construction of the audiovisual language.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Reisz.The technique of film editing'''.'''Focal, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences with the cinema ==

=== Analysis of the movement in the audiovisual art and the cinema ===
While the audiovisual art is always connected with a past of unfathomable character, the cinema can never be separated from the present time, because it depicts its physical representation. The few films that tend to an evocation of the still image do it only sometimes, to then return to what is their natural environment.

In the audiovisual art, the only movement expressed is the extrinsic montage of change from one shot to the next one, and while in the cinema this also happens, the internal movement of objects and characters of each one of the corresponding shots is added to its intrinsic montage, a movement that does not occur in the audiovisual art.&lt;ref&gt;“Montaje Cinematográfico, Arte de Movimiento” Rafael C. Sanchez. La Crujía. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

While the development of the aesthetic of the movement has for the cinema its purpose as an artistic means of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Spottiswoode.A Grammar of the film.1965&lt;/ref&gt; in the audiovisual art the method is a different one, more related to the contemplation.

The '''Center for Probing the Nanoscale''' (CPN) at [[Stanford University]] was founded in 2004 by researchers from Stanford University and [[IBM]]. The center is one of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSEC). The goal of the center is to develop and apply novel nanoprobes that dramatically improve our capability to observe, manipulate, and control [[nanoscale]] objects and phenomena. Developed technology will be transferred to industry for commercial implementation. Nanoprobe development and applications are under way in five theme groups, focusing on Individual Nanomagnet Characterization, Nanoscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nanoscale Electrical Imaging, Plasmonic Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and BioProbes.

Besides the scientific research activities, CPN members actively engage in public outreach programs to bring nanoscale science and technology to a broad and diverse audience. A Summer Institute for Middle School Teachers is held each summer and gives teachers the opportunity to learn about nanotechnology, engage with scientists, develop course material and get hands-on experience in research labs. Nanoprobe lectures and video recordings from various workshops are also available on-line.

In 1993, Burr wrote a cover story, "Homosexuality and Biology", for ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/articles/homosexualitybiology.pdf Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt; The story became the basis for his first book ''[[A Separate Creation]]: The Search for the Biological Origins of Sexual Orientation'' (1996), which investigated [[sexual orientation]] research. ''A Separate Creation'' was published by [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]], a subsidiary of the [[Walt Disney Company]], and its argument that sexual orientation is inborn prompted a call by [[Southern Baptists]] to boycott Disney films and theme parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/bio.htm Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' published Burr's article "Why Conservatives Should Embrace the Gay Gene", in which he argued that scientific research demonstrating that sexual orientation is biologically determined supports a conservative view of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/newsite/content/articles/weeklystandard.php Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120220170547/http://www.chandlerburr.com/newsite/content/articles/weeklystandard.php |date=2012-02-20 }} chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Burr's ''The Emperor of Scent'', published in 2003, tells how the French-Italian scientist [[Luca Turin]] originated the theory about the functioning of the [[sense of smell]]. As a result, ''The New Yorker'' proposed that Burr describe the creation of a perfume. Burr's March 2005 ''New Yorker'' article recounted [[Jean-Claude Ellena]]'s year-long creation, in Paris and Grasse, of [[Hermès]]' Un Jardin sur le Nil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/14/050314fa_fact Annals of Innovation: The Scent of the Nile : The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Burr's ''The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York'', published in 2008, describes Ellena's creation of Un Jardin sur le Nil in Paris, and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]'s creation of [[Lovely (perfume)|Lovely]] in New York City under the license [[aegis]] of the perfume corporation [[Coty, Inc.|Coty]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18238465 NPR] npr.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Burr’s novel, ''You Or Someone Like You'', was published by Ecco in summer 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/11120-a-hollywood-novel-that-isn-t-pw-profiles-chandler-burr-.html A Hollywood Novel That Isn't: PW profiles Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From August 2006 until the end of 2010, Burr was perfume critic of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;
==Museum curation ==
In December 2010 he founded the Department of [[Olfactory art]] at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in New York City. In December 2010, Burr left ''The New York Times'' to curate the exhibition "The Art of Scent: 1889-2011" at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basenotes.net/content/626-New-York-s-Museum-of-Art-and-Design-to-open-dedicated-fragrance-department-curated-by-Chandler-Burr?s=3185ed804b468be3cd7a1aa8169b30d3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720144723/http://www.basenotes.net/content/626-New-York-s-Museum-of-Art-and-Design-to-open-dedicated-fragrance-department-curated-by-Chandler-Burr?s=3185ed804b468be3cd7a1aa8169b30d3 |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed visitors to experience seminal works by some of the greatest scent artists of the late-19th, 20th and early-21st centuries such as Jean-Claude Ellena, [[Ernest Beaux]], and [[Jacques Cavallier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PR/1000_Filename_Center%20of%20Olfactory%20Art%20and%20Burr%20Announcement%20Release_FINAL.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201412/http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PR/1000_Filename_Center%20of%20Olfactory%20Art%20and%20Burr%20Announcement%20Release_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that when asked about his refusal to display packaging or bottles, Burr replied "[T]he smell [is] the work of art.

If you have to see it, I’m not interested."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/arts/design/perfume-as-an-art-form-at-museum-of-art-and-design.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Chandler%20Burr%20Carol%20Kino&amp;st=cse Scent of a Museum] by Carol King, ''New York Times'' March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
==Personal life==
Burr  lives in [[New York City]].

The [[Bogotá]] newspaper ''El Tiempo'' in its edition of 2 December 2011 carried an article on how Burr reportedly had failed to disclose his sexual orientation in petitioning to [[LGBT adoption|adopt]] two Colombian [[orphan]]s. As a result, the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar halted the adoption proceedings, claiming a lack of candor on Burr's part; Burr responded that the children knew about his sexual orientation and "they didn't care".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/3148 Gay Father Overcomes Discrimination to Win Adoption Case in Colombia] Americas Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2011 it was reported that the adoptions were made official and that Burr and his adopted sons were reunited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-10911795.html Estadounidense gay recupera a sus dos hijos adoptados - Noticias de Justicia en Colombia] ELTIEMPO.COM&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burr is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"People ask me, "Is there that much to write about perfume?" Lanvin just sent me its latest, Rumeur. If I weren't already an atheist, I would lose my faith in God again. But it gave me an idea for another piece for the Times." Chandler Burr, The Independent (London), September 4, 2006, Pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-profit work==
In 2014 Burr established the Department of Scent Art as an independent [[501c3]] non-profit arts organization based in New York. The DSA produces exhibitions such as ''Hyper-Natural: Scent from Art to Design'' at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], Melbourne.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Beyond Sight|url=http://www.artbeyondsight.org/sidebar/aboutaeb.shtml|website=Art Beyond Sight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], '''connotation''' arises when the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the [[community]]. A second level of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]s is termed connotative. These meanings are not [[object (philosophy)|objective]] representations of the ''thing'', but new usages produced by the language group.

==Discussion==
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, or hear, and
*as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
Connotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or [[concept]] originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the [[code (semiotics)|coding]] system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the [[audience]]. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must  learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in [[memory]]. 

The power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts and to introduce subtlety into the [[discourse]]. For example, a digital [[thermometer]] produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an ''indexical'' sign of [[heat]] (adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]], in this case a [[metaphor]], for the health of the body. Such [[information]] adds to other [[data]] forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative [[cognitive]] level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of [[symbol]]ic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature.

Connotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The [[semantic]] content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's [[value (semiotics)|values]] and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by [[paradigm]]s and [[syntagm]]s excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] tests such as the [[commutation test]] have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different [[typeface|font]]s for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of [[synonym]]s and [[antonym]]s clarifies connotational choices as between, say, [[pejorative]] and [[euphemistic]] usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture—for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural [[mythology|myth]]s and [[prejudice]]s which are less reasonable.

'''Earth Economics''' is a [[501c3]] non-profit headquartered in [[Tacoma, Washington]], United States. The organization uses natural [[capital valuation]] to help decision makers and local stakeholders understand the value of [[natural capital]] assets. By identifying, monetizing, and valuing natural capital and [[ecosystem services]], Earth Economics helps communities and organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. The organization has a small in-house staff of [[economists]] that collaborate with experts in [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[hydrology]], [[policy]] and [[systems modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org|title=Home|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

Earth Economics' current mission states, "We quantify and value the benefits nature provides. Our work drives effective decisions and systemic change through a combination of education, natural capital analysis, and policy recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/vision/|title=Mission and Vision|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, Earth Economics offers "a pragmatic, collaborative approach to help organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build resilience by taking nature into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/what-we-do|title=What We Do|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization currently focuses on the global and regional priorities of working lands, freshwater, oceans, forests, and communities.

Earth Economics offers five types of services: 
* Workshops &amp; Trainings: Earth Economics offers hands-on workshops, trainings, and presentations that aim to raise awareness about ecological economics concepts and cost-effective solutions that build resilience, [[biodiversity]], and equity. 
* Ecosystem Services Valuation: Earth Economics is best known for their expertise in natural capital valuation. The Ecosystem Valuation Toolkit (EVT), an expanding and searchable database of ecosystem service values, serves as the foundation for these analyses. 
* Benefit-Cost Analysis: Earth Economics’ benefit-cost analysis framework expands traditional cost-benefit equations to include ecosystem services and other factors including health, recreation, and effects on culture and community. 
* Industry Analysis: Earth Economics works with businesses and economic development agencies to reduce risk, improve the efficiency of operations, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and expand job opportunities. 
* Finance &amp; Investment Strategies: Earth Economics works with organizations to develop innovative approaches and practical financing strategies to preserve, enhance, or restore natural capital assets, including [[conservation lands]], [[green infrastructure]], working forests and farms, and [[green building]]s.

==History==

Originally known as the Asia-Pacific Environmental Exchange (APEX), the organization was founded as a project of [[The Tides Center]]. The initial co-founders were David Batker, Jim Puckett, [[Annie Leonard]], Joshua Farley, Joshua Reyneveld, and Isabel De La Torre. Earth Economics evolved into an autonomous organization and received IRS [[501(c)3]] tax exempt, public charity status in March 2006.

From 2006 until 2016, co-founder David Batker acted as Earth Economics' Executive Director and Chief Economist. In 2016, Batker moved to a joint President and Chief Economist position. Batker's research and advocacy focuses on the value that natural systems have in providing food, water, flood risk reduction, climate stabilization, and other benefits. His work has been used to establish the value of watersheds and new funding mechanisms for maintaining natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/study-puts-price-on-puget-sound/|title=Study puts price on Puget Sound|date=2008-07-25|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Economics has a track record of working alongside NGOs, businesses, and governmental organizations to inform investment and shift local and international policy in ways that account for the benefits of ecosystem services. Since 2013, Earth Economics has been working to incorporate ecosystem services in federal benefit-cost analysis and accounting practices.

The '''Economic Warfare School''' (EGE in French) is a French academic curriculum dedicated to [[competitive intelligence]].

== History ==
The Economic Warfare School was created in October 1997 by General Officer Jean Pichot-Duclos, former head of the [[French Army]] Intelligence Training Centre and Christian Harbulot Chief Operating Officer for [[competitive intelligence]] at [[Défense conseil international|DCI group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/1997/05/08/-_206297|title=La guerre économique, un art qui s'enseigne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Economic Warfare School offers [[Master of Business Administration|MBA program]] specialized in [[Competitive intelligence]] and [[Strategy]] for students who have graduated from prestigious schools and universities. It also offers a one-year professional program for senior managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/les-formations-executives.html|title=Les formations executives - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/la-formation-initiale.html|title=Les formations initiales - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum and research program  of the Economic Warfare School are based on a forward-looking [[risk management]] methodology which goes beyond those traditionally used by corporate management and market competition theories so that they are specifically tailored to suit decision-makers' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/l-ecole/presentation/economic-warfare-school-of-paris.html|title=Economic Warfare School of Paris - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique academic approach of the school combines constant production of knowledge, investigation and use of information technologies. Throughout their entire program the students work for the benefit of real actors of the public and private sector allowing them to face the reality and responsibilities of their future jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/la-formation-initiale/programme-mercurie.html |title=Programme MercurIE - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté |publisher=Ege.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unique teaching programme makes it one of the most renowned school in its field worldwilde and enables its graduates to be directly operational for [[Competitive intelligence|competitive]] and [[business intelligence]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/actualites/evenements/item/classement-international-best-masters-2017-l-ege-en-tete-des-formations-francaises-en-intelligence-economique.html |title=Classement international Best Masters 2017 : L’EGE en tête des formations françaises en intelligence économique - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté |publisher=Ege.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders. The ECOWEEK workshops have developed sustainable proposals for ''Copenhagen,&lt;ref&gt;Oxgren, Dorthe. (15-05-2013).'' Studerende skal gore Nordvest gronnere.

== The GREENHOUSE ==
[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

An '''edcamp''' is a participant-driven conference - commonly referred to as an "[[unconference]]". Edcamps are designed to provide participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edcampfoundation.org/|title=Vision and mission|date=The edcamp foundation|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps are modeled after [[BarCamp]]s, free participant-driven conferences with a primary focus on technology and computers.  Educational technology is a common topic area for edcamps, as are pedagogy, practical examples in instructional use of modern tools, and solving the problems technology can introduce into the classroom environment.  

Edcamps are generally free or very low-cost, built around ''[[ad hoc]]'' community participation. Sessions are not planned until the day of the event, when participants can volunteer to facilitate a conversation on a topic of their choice or simply choose an idea they are interested in learning more about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/about-edcamp-unconference-history|title=Introduction to Edcamp: A New Conference Model Built on Collaboration|date=September 29, 2010|publisher=Edutopia|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps operate "without keynote speakers or vendor booths, encourage participants to find or lead a conversation that meet their needs and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-08-07/community/hc-simsbury-ed-camp-20120806_1_educators-ethel-walker-participants|title=Ethel Walker To Host 'EdCamp' Conference Friday|date=August 7, 2012|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edcamp was held in May 2010 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcampphilly.org|title=Edcamp Philly Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, there have been over [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/complete+edcamp+calendar 1,000 edcamp events] held throughout the world. The [http://www.edcamp.org Edcamp Foundation] was formed in December 2011 to help teachers and other stakeholders who organize edcamps. The vision of the Edcamp Foundation is to "promote organic, participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators worldwide." The Edcamp Foundation is still located in Conshohocken, PA. The Foundation has implemented a variety of programs to help participants and organizers get the most out of edcamps like Impact Grants, Edcamp-In-A-Box, and the Urban Initiative. 

The first edcamps that were held in languages other than English were '''edcamp Stockholm''' on October 31, 2011 (in Swedish) and [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/edcamp+Montréal edcamp Montreal] on November 1, 2011 (in French). There has also been International edcamps in Spain, China, Indonesia, Canada, and more.

The '''''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences''''' is a specialized fifteen-volume [[Encyclopedia]] first published in 1930 and last published in 1967. It was envisaged in the 1920s by scholars working in disciplines which increasingly were coming to be known as "human sciences" or "[[social science]]s". The goal was to create a comprehensive synthesis of the study of human affairs as undertaken by practitioners of all fields involved in such study. The parameters of what would come to be known as "social science" were in many ways initially established and defined by this publication.

The {{em|Encyclopaedia}}'s founding organizations included the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Economic Association]], the [[American Historical Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Sociological Society]], the [[American Statistical Association]], the [[Association of American Law Schools]], and the [[National Education Association]]. It was edited by American economists [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]]. Seligman and Johnson solicited contributions from many of the most known and respected scholars in their fields, and established many links with European scholars in the process. The [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], and [[Russell Sage Foundation]] provided initial financial support, and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] was selected as publisher.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc. Records, 1927–1934, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, [[Columbia University Library]]. http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-rb/ldpd_12107465/dsc/6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. A. J. Johnson, "The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences", in [[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]], Vol. 50, No. 2 (Feb., 1936), pp. 355–366. {{jstor|1885029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Caldwell, "Demography and Social Science", in Population Studies: A Journal of Demography, Volume 50, Issue 3, 1996. {{doi|10.1080/0032472031000149516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international network of social scientists developed in the process of creating the {{em|Encyclopaedia}} would prove especially important during the [[Nazi]] occupation of Europe, during which many contributing scholars fled persecution for their ideas.  Under Johnson's invitation, several of these scholars would come to [[New York City]] and form the "University in Exile", a specialized graduate school now known as the [[New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Krohn, Claus-Dieter. 1993. Intellectuals in Exile: Refugee Scholars and the New School for Social Research. Trans. Rita and Robert Kimber.

New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{em|Encyclopaedia}} was last printed in 1967, then in its 16th edition. It was succeeded by the [[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]], edited by David L. Sills, and also published by Macmillan.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

'''Ennejma Ezzahra''' ("Star of Zahra", sometimes spelled '''Nejma Ezzohara'''), is a palace at [[Sidi Bou Said]], in northern [[Tunisia]], built by Baron [[Rodolphe d'Erlanger]] (1872–1932) as his home there.&lt;ref name="Cowell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/23/garden/in-tunisia-a-rare-visit-to-a-palace-and-its-owner.html|title=In Tunisia, A Rare Visit To a Palace And Its Owner|last=Cowell|first=Alan|date=23 July 1987|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equity theory''' focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships, 4th Edition|author1=Guerrero, Laura K |author2=Peter A. Andersen |author3=Walid A. Afifi. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Sage Publications Inc|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-1710-9|location = Los Angeles, CA|pages = 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacy Adams, a [[Workplace psychology|workplace]] and [[Behavioral psychology|behavioral psychologist]], who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others (Adams, 1963). The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the [[Justice|fairness]] maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization.

==Background==
Equity theory focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. It proposes that individuals who perceive themselves as either under-rewarded or over-rewarded will experience distress, and that this distress leads to efforts to restore equity within the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]].  It focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners.  Equity is measured by comparing the [[ratio]]s of contributions and benefits of each person within the relationship.  Partners do not have to receive equal benefits (such as receiving the same amount of love, care, and financial security) or make equal contributions (such as investing the same amount of effort, time, and financial resources), as long as the ratio between these benefits and contributions is similar. Much like other prevalent theories of motivation, such as [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs]], equity theory acknowledges that subtle and variable individual factors affect each person’s assessment and perception of their relationship with their relational partners (Guerrero et al., 2005). According to Adams (1965), anger is induced by underpayment inequity and guilt is induced with overpayment equity (Spector 2008). Payment whether hourly wage or salary, is the main concern and therefore the cause of equity or inequity in most cases.

In any position, an employee wants to feel that their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay. If an employee feels underpaid then it will result in the employee feeling hostile towards the organization and perhaps their co-workers, which may result in the employee not performing well at work anymore. It is the subtle variables that also play an important role in the feeling of equity. Just the idea of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes.

===Definition of equity===
Individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any perceived inequities.
Referent Comparisons:

===Inputs and outcomes===

====Inputs====
Inputs are defined as each participant’s contributions to the relational exchange and are viewed as entitling him/her to rewards or costs. The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets – entitling him/her to rewards – or liabilities - entitling him/her to costs. The entitlement to rewards or costs ascribed to each input vary depending on the relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as "relevant inputs" – inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor to rewards. In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor to social rewards. Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs (Walster, Traupmann &amp; Walster, 1978). Inputs typically include any of the following:

* [[Time]]
*education 
*experience
*Effort
* [[Loyalty]]
*Hard Work
*Commitment
*Ability
*Adaptability
* [[Flexibility]]
* [[Toleration|Tolerance]]
*Determination
* [[Enthusiasm]]
*Personal [[sacrifice]]
*Trust in superiors
*Support from co-workers and colleagues
*Skill

====Outcomes====
Outcomes are defined as the positive and negative consequences that an individual perceives a participant has incurred as a consequence of his/her relationship with another.  When the ratio of inputs to outcomes is close, then the employee should have much satisfaction with their job. Outputs can be both tangible and intangible.&lt;ref name="Love and attraction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=ed. by Mark|title=Love and attraction : an internat. conference|year=1979|publisher=Pergamon Pr.|location=Oxford [u. a.]|isbn=008022234X|pages=309–323|url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/49.pdf|edition=1.|author2=Wilson, Glenn|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical outcomes include any of the following:

* [[Job security]]
* [[Salary]]
* [[Employee benefit]]
*Expenses
*Recognition
* [[Reputation]]
* [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
*Sense of achievement
*Praise
*Thanks
*Stimuli

===Propositions===
Equity theory consists of four propositions:

; self-inside: Individuals seek to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes are defined as rewards minus costs).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[ultimatum game]]s show, that the maximation of outcomes is only one of several objectives for an individual. In order to foster rules desired by an individual, the individual may be willing to sacrifice maximum outcomes. (Bala)&lt;/ref&gt;
; self-outside: Groups can maximize collective rewards by developing accepted systems for equitably apportioning rewards and costs among members.  Systems of equity will evolve within groups, and members will attempt to induce other members to accept and adhere to these systems.  The only way groups can induce members to equitably behave is by making it more profitable to behave equitably than inequitably.  Thus, groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish (increase the cost for) members who treat others inequitably.
; others-inside: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed.  The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person who gets "too much" and the person who gets "too little" feel distressed.  The person who gets too much may feel guilt or shame.  The person who gets too little may feel angry or humiliated.
; other-outside: Individuals who perceive that they are in an inequitable relationship attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity.  The greater the inequity, the more distress people feel and the more they try to restore equity. (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978)

==In business==
Equity theory has been widely applied to [[business]] settings by industrial psychologists to describe the relationship between an employee's motivation and his or her perception of equitable or inequitable treatment.  In a business setting, the relevant [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] relationship is that between employee and employer.  As in marriage and other contractual dyadic relationships, equity theory assumes that employees seek to maintain an equitable ratio between the inputs they bring to the relationship and the outcomes they receive from it (Adams, 1965).  Equity theory in business, however, introduces the concept of social comparison, whereby employees evaluate their own input/output ratios based on their comparison with the input/outcome ratios of other employees (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).  Inputs in this context include the employee’s time, expertise, qualifications, experience, intangible personal qualities such as drive and ambition, and interpersonal skills.  Outcomes include monetary compensation, perquisites ("perks"), benefits, and flexible work arrangements.  Employees who perceive inequity will seek to reduce it, either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds ("cognitive distortion"), directly altering inputs and/or outcomes, or leaving the organization (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).  These perceptions of inequity are perceptions of [[organizational justice]], or more specifically, injustice. Subsequently, the theory has wide-reaching implications for employee [[morale]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], [[productivity]], and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].

===Assumptions of equity theory applied to business===
The three primary assumptions applied to most business applications of equity theory can be summarized as follows:

# Employees expect a fair return for what they contribute to their jobs, a concept referred to as the "equity norm".
# Employees determine what their equitable return should be after comparing their inputs and outcomes with those of their coworkers. This concept is referred to as "social comparison".
# Employees who perceive themselves as being in an inequitable situation will seek to reduce the inequity either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds ("cognitive distortion"), by directly altering inputs and/or outputs, or by leaving the organization. (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978)''

===Implications for managers===
Equity theory has several implications for business managers:

*People measure the totals of their inputs and outcomes. This means a working mother may accept lower monetary compensation in return for more flexible working hours.
*Different employees ascribe personal values to inputs and outcomes. Thus, two employees of equal experience and qualification performing the same work for the same pay may have [[Double Demotivation|quite different perceptions of the fairness of the deal]].
*Employees are able to adjust for purchasing power and local market conditions. Thus a teacher from Alberta may accept lower compensation than his colleague in Toronto if his cost of living is different, while a teacher in a remote African village may accept a totally different pay structure.
*Although it may be acceptable for more senior staff to receive higher compensation, there are limits to the balance of the scales of equity and employees can find excessive executive pay demotivating.
*Staff perceptions of inputs and outcomes of themselves and others may be incorrect, and perceptions need to be managed effectively.
*An employee who believes he is overcompensated may increase his effort. However he may also adjust the values that he ascribes to his own personal inputs. It may be that he or she internalizes a sense of superiority and actually decrease his efforts.

==Criticisms and related theories==
Criticism has been directed toward both the assumptions and practical application of equity theory.  Scholars have questioned the simplicity of the model, arguing that a number of demographic and psychological variables affect people's perceptions of fairness and interactions with others.  Furthermore, much of the research supporting the basic propositions of equity theory has been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus has questionable applicability to real-world situations (Huseman, Hatfield &amp; Miles, 1987).  Critics have also argued that people might perceive equity/inequity not only in terms of the specific inputs and outcomes of a relationship, but also in terms of the overarching system that determines those inputs and outputs.  Thus, in a business setting, one might feel that his or her compensation is equitable to other employees', but one might view the entire compensation ''system'' as unfair (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). 
 
Researchers have offered numerous magnifying and competing perspectives:

===Equity sensitivity construct===
The Equity Sensitivity Construct proposes that individuals have different preferences for equity and thus react in different ways to perceived equity and inequity.  Preferences can be expressed on a continuum from preferences for extreme under-benefit to preferences for extreme over-benefit.  Three archetypal classes are as follows:

*Benevolents, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be less than those of their relational partner.  In other words, the benevolent prefers to be under-benefitted.
*Equity Sensitives, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be equal to those of their relational partner.
*Entitleds, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to exceed those of their relational partner.  In other words, the entitled prefers to be over-benefitted. (Huseman, Hatfield &amp; Miles, 1987)

===Fairness model===
The Fairness Model proposes an alternative measure of equity/inequity to the relational partner or "comparison person" of standard equity theory.  According to the Fairness Model, an individual judges the overall "fairness" of a relationship by comparing their inputs and outcomes with an internally derived standard.  The Fairness Model thus allows for the perceived equity/inequity of the overarching system to be incorporated into individuals' evaluations of their relationships (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).

===Game theory===
Behavioral economics has recently started to apply [[game theory]] to the study of equity theory. For instance, Gill and Stone (2010) analyze how considerations of equity influence behavior in strategic settings in which people compete and develop the implications for optimal labor contracts.

The first documented use of the term '''firsthand learning''', by Mark St. John of Inverness Research Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/1999-09-Rpt-waitdonttellme-polinqlc.PDF | last=St. John | first=Mark | title=Wait!

Firsthand learning is, at its core, learning from [[direct experience]].

Arising from a learner's [[innate]] [[curiosity]] and the desire to investigate real phenomena, firsthand learning empowers people by providing them with opportunities to figure things out for themselves, to believe in the analytical abilities of their own minds, and to connect with the world around them. It requires close engagement with the immediate environment.

Firsthand learning is an [[inquiry]] process that is generative of questions that focus subsequent investigations. The process invites learners to gather and record their observations, to analyze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Firsthand learning involves communication of the results of this investigative process. Sharing evidence and discussing findings with others underscores that learning is a social process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13574">[[File:Wainwright building st louis USA.jpg|thumb|The [[Wainwright Building]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], designed by [[Louis Sullivan]], is emblematic of his famous maxim "form follows function".|300x300px]]
'''Form follows function''' is a principle associated with 20th-century [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and [[industrial design]] which says that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

== Origins of the phrase ==
The architect [[Louis Sullivan]] coined the [[Saying|maxim]], although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] (1805{{en dash}}1852),&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Greenough, ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art'', edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the ijaz phrase is a fitting summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture.

Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the [[transcendentalist]] thinking and the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] protestantism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;/ref&gt; whose thinking mostly predates the later [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough''.

Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], and [[Herman Melville|Melville]], as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull|title=The tall office building artistically considered|last=Sullivan|first=Louis H.|date=1896|others=Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he later attributed the core idea to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect, engineer, and author [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]], who first asserted in his book ''[[De architectura]]'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful.&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography of an Idea |last=Sullivan |first=Louis |year=1924 |publisher=Press of the American institute of Architects, Inc. |location=New York City |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan actually wrote "form ever follows function", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single "rule that shall permit of no exception". The full quote is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, '''''form ever follows function''''', and this is the law.  Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. 
It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, '''that form ever follows function.''' ''This is the law.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sullivan | first=Louis H. | title=The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered | journal=Lippincott's Magazine | issue=March 1896 | pages=403–409 | year=1896 |url= https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel [[skyscraper]] in late 19th Century [[Chicago]] at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, "form follows function", as opposed to "form follows precedent". Sullivan's assistant [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form—perhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.

== Debate on the functionality of ornamentation ==

In 1908, the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] wrote an allegorical essay titled "[[Ornament and Crime]]" in reaction to the excessive invented ornament used by the [[Vienna Secession]] architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2014}}

== Application in different fields ==

=== Architecture ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The phrase '''"form (ever) follows function"''' became a [[battle cry]] of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call "ornament", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival|celtic revival]] decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]] on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature.

=== Product design ===

One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined [[Chrysler Airflow]], when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a "teardrop" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meikle's "Twentieth Century Limited:  Industrial Design in America, 1925 &amp;ndash; 1939"&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors]] adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, [[drag coefficient]] has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.

The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like [[Raymond Loewy]], [[Norman bel Geddes]] and [[Henry Dreyfuss]] grappled with the inherent contradictions of "form follows function" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his &lt;span id="MAYA"&gt;"MAYA" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable)&lt;/span&gt; principle to express that product designs are bounded by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising.

By honestly applying "form follows function", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding [[product differentiation]]. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (''cf.'' [[planned obsolescence]]) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary.

[[Victor Papanek]] (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of "form follows function."

=== Software engineering ===
It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The principle can also be applied to Enterprise Application Architectures of modern business where "function" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or "form". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. SOA [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] enables an [[Enterprise Architect]] to rearrange the "form" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability.

Furthermore, [[Domain-Driven Design]] postulates that structure ([[Software architecture]], [[Design Pattern]], [[Implementation]]) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain ([[Functional requirement]]).

While "form" and "function" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, [[Metaprogramming]] and the [[Functional programming]] paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts.

The [[Agile software development]] movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests.

=== Automobile designing ===

If the design of an automobile conforms to its function—for instance the [[Fiat Multipla]]'s shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows—then its form is said to follow its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19990719/ANE/907190815/multipla-designer-shows-that-form-follows-function|title=MULTIPLA DESIGNER SHOWS THAT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION|work=Automotive News|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
According to [[Lamarck]]'s long-discredited [[Lamarckism|theory of evolution]], anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, [[giraffe]]s are taller to reach the leaves of [[tree]]s. By contrast, in [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]], form ([[mutation|variation]]) ''precedes'' function (as determined by [[natural selection|selection]]). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function "better", and are therefore more successful reproductively.

'''Futurism''' ({{lang-it|Futurismo}}) was an [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[social movement]] that originated in [[Italy]] in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Luigi Russolo]]. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnason|last2=Harvard|first2=H.|last3=Mansfield|first3=Elizabeth|title=History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography|date=December 2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205259472|pages=189|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important Futurist works included Marinetti's ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', Boccioni's sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', Balla's painting ''[[Abstract Speed + Sound]]'', and Russolo's ''[[The Art of Noises]]''. Although it was largely an [[Italians|Italian]] phenomenon, there were parallel movements in [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Belgium]] and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even [[Futurist meals]]. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements [[Art Deco]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and to a greater degree [[Precisionism]], [[Rayonism]], and [[Vorticism]].

==Italian Futurism==
Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"/&gt;  Marinetti launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut28144gut Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''I manifesti del futurismo'', February 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in ''La gazzetta dell'Emilia'', an article then reproduced in  the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on Saturday 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2883730/f1.image Le Figaro, ''Le Futurisme'', 1909/02/20 (Numéro 51)]. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaai190904-01.2.3&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-futurism------ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''Declaration of Futurism'', published in Poesia, Volume 5, Number 6, April 1909] (Futurist manifesto translated to English). Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy"&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Futurist_Aristocracy_1_1923.pdf Futurist Manifesto, reproduced in ''Futurist Aristocracy'', New York, April 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and the composer [[Luigi Russolo]]. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. "We want no part of it, the past", he wrote, "we the young and strong ''Futurists!''"  The Futurists admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, "however daring, however violent", bore proudly "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting.  Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings:  "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places.  ...  The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by [[Giovanni Segantini]] and others.  Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art.&lt;ref&gt;Severini, G., ''The Life of a Painter'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-691-04419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severini was the first to come into contact with [[Cubism]] and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.  Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.

[[File:Umberto Boccioni 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Umberto Boccioni]], sketch of ''[[The City Rises]]'' (1910)]]
They often painted modern urban scenes.  Carrà's ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli|Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'' (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904.  The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes.  His ''Leaving the Theatre'' (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni's [[The City Rises (Boccioni)|''The City Rises'']]  (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control.  His ''States of Mind'', in three large panels, ''The Farewell'', ''Those who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay'', "made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in [[Bergson]], Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting."&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, R. ''Futurism'', Tate Gallery, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and "emotional ambience" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

Boccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it.  The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted.  Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, ''Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico'' (''Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism'') (1914).&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of Boccioni's debt to Bergson, see Petrie, Brian, "Boccioni and Bergson", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 116, No.852, March 1974, pp.140-147, and Antliff, Mark "The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space", ''The Art Bulletin'', December 2000, pp.720-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giacomo Balla, 1912, Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, oil on canvas, 89.8 x 109.8 cm, Albright-Knox Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giacomo Balla]], 1912, ''[[Dinamismo di un Cane al Guinzaglio]]'' (''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash''), [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]]]]
Balla's ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement.  The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash&amp;nbsp;—and the feet of the woman walking it&amp;nbsp;—have been multiplied to a blur of movement.  It illustrates the precepts of the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' that, "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career.  Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;  His ''Rhythm of the Bow'' (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism.  But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]]. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's  ''Woman with Absinthe'' (1911),  Severini's ''Self-Portrait'' (1912), and Boccioni's  ''Matter'' (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911), Severini's ''Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin'' (1912), and Russolo's ''Automobile at Speed'' (1913)

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.  In ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of "dynamism".  The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the [[Tate Modern]]. (It now appears on the national side of [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20 eurocent coins]]). He explored the theme further in ''Synthesis of Human Dynamism'' (1912), ''Speeding Muscles'' (1913) and ''Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles'' (1913).  His ideas on sculpture were published in the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture |publisher=Unknown.nu |date=1910-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract "reconstructions", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises.  He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that "the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc."&lt;ref name=MartinM&gt;Martin, Marianne W. ''Futurist Art and Theory'', Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964) and [[Giovanni Papini]] (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism.  The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish "an immobile church with an infallible creed", and each group dismissed the other as ''passéiste.''

Futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic.  The ''Futurist Manifesto'' had declared, "We will glorify war&amp;nbsp;—the world's only hygiene&amp;nbsp;—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/manifesto.html |title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=MartinM/&gt;  Then, fearing the re-election of [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]], Marinetti published a political manifesto.  In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag.  When Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, many Futurists enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Jerry, "Back to the Future", The New Yorker, September 6, 2004, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'The Futurist mountains': Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War|journal = Modern Italy|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1353-2944|pages = 323–338|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13532944.2013.806289|first = Selena|last = Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Futurist War Noises: Confronting and Coping with the First World War|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fx1p115#page-1|website = California Italian Studies|accessdate = 2015-09-13|last = Daly|first = Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914.  Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916.  Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. ''War'', ''Armored Train'', and ''Red Cross Train''), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the [[Return to Order]].

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement.  This revival was called ''il secondo Futurismo'' (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s.  The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has classified Futurism by decades: "Plastic Dynamism" for the first decade, "Mechanical Art" for the 1920s, "Aeroaesthetics" for the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==
{{main|Russian Futurism|Cubo-Futurism}}
[[File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Goncharova]], ''Cyclist'', 1913]]
Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as [[David Burlyuk]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]] found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all [[suprematism]] movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksey Kruchenykh]]. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was [[Cubo-Futurism]], adopted in 1913 when [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow.  Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of [[Cubism]] with the representation of movement.  Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that [[Pushkin]] and [[Dostoevsky]] should be "heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution of 1917]]. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] establishment and the [[Agitprop]] movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.

[[File:Casa Sant'Elia.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Futurist architecture]] by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]]]

==Architecture==
{{further|Futurist architecture}}
The Futurist architect [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for ''La Città Nuova'' (The New City) (1912–1914).  This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists.  The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected.  The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life.  Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine.  He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity.  In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy.  The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]]-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and [[post office]]s.  Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are [[Trento]]'s railway station, built by [[Angiolo Mazzoni]], and the [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella station]] in [[Florence]].  The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the ''Gruppo Toscano'' (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included [[Giovanni Michelucci]] and [[Italo Gamberini]], with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==
{{main|Futurism (music)}}
Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

[[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a ''Manifesto of Futurist Musicians'' in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the "sublime genius" of [[Wagner]] and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elgar]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Sibelius]]. By contrast, the Italian [[symphony]] was dominated by [[opera]] in an "absurd and anti-musical form". The [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the "rickety and vulgar" operas of [[Puccini]] and [[Umberto Giordano]]. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher [[Pietro Mascagni]], because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice."

[[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947) wrote ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russolo |first=Luigi |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |title=The Art of Noises on Theremin Vox |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2004-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122724/http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html The Art of Noises] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called ''[[intonarumori]]'', which were [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[noise]] generators that permitted the performer to create and control the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with ''intonarumori'', in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/lombardi.html |title=Daniele Lombardi in ''Futurism and Musical Notes'' |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russolo's ''intonarumori'' influenced [[Stravinsky]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[George Antheil]], [[Edgar Varèse]],&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; [[Stockhausen]] and [[John Cage]]. In [[Pacific 231]], Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''The Steel Step'' and in his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is the American [[George Antheil]]. His fascination with machinery is evident in his ''Airplane Sonata'', ''Death of the Machines'', and the 30-minute ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The ''Ballet Mécanique'' was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by [[Fernand Léger]], but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three [[xylophones]], four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

Other composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably [[Franco Casavola]], who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and [[Arthur-Vincent Lourié]], the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five ''Synthèses'' offer a form of dodecaphony, while ''Formes en l'air'' was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, [[Leo Ornstein]] gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the [[Daily Sketch]] newspaper ''"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital."''

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine.  The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience.  The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian {{Ill|Giannina Censi|it}}. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her "Aerodanze" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: " I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt."&lt;ref&gt;Klöck, A. (1999) ''Of Cyborg Technologies and Fascistized Mermaids: Giannina Censi’s ‘Aerodanze’ in 1930s Italy'', Theatre Journal 51(4): 395–415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/futurism Juliet Bellow, ''Futurism and Dance'', Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism, 305], American University, 09/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{main|Futurism (literature)}}
Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem).  The Futurists called their style of poetry ''parole in libertà'' (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.
There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as  Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (''Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista'' edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le ''locomotive con le calze'''(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in ''Sam Dunn è morto'' (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.

==1920s and 1930s==
[[File:Joseph Stella, 1919-20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stella]], 1919-20, ''Brooklyn Bridge'', oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]
[[File:Blast2.jpg|thumb|The cover of the last edition of ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'', the [[literary magazine]] of the British [[Vorticist]] movement, a movement heavily influenced by Futurism]]
Many Italian Futurists supported [[Fascism]] in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (''Partito Politico Futurista'') in early 1918, which was absorbed into [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci di combattimento]]'' in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the [[National Fascist Party]]. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them "reactionary", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in [[architecture]]. After the [[Second World War]], many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so.  Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said, "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.  Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board.  Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each.  He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things.  He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.

[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|thumb|An example of Futurist design: "Skyscraper Lamp", by the Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], 1929]]
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters.  They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and the Italo-German [[Pact of Steel]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günther, "New Research on Futurism and its Relations with the Fascist Regime", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 2007, Vol. 42, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of [[Georges Sorel]], whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

Futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.

===Aeropainting===
{{main|Aeropittura}}
Aeropainting (''aeropittura'') was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926.  The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title=Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter'' |publisher=Simultaneita.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |archivedate=2010-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter.  Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;" ... dal realismo esasperato e compiaciuto (in particolare delle opere propagandistiche) alle forme asatratte (come in Dottori: ''Trittico della velocità''), dal dinamismo alle quieti lontane dei paesaggi umbri di Dottori ... ." ''L'aeropittura futurista'' http://users.libero.it/macbusc/id22.htm&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's ''Portrait of il Duce''), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta]], [[Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori|Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini|Prampolini]], [[Somenzi]] and [[:it:Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)|Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)]]. The artists stated that  "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything." Crispolti identifies three main "positions" in aeropainting: "a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism'  ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in [[Tullio Crali|Crali]], but also in Tato and Ambrosi)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispolti, E., "Aeropainting", in Hulten, P., ''Futurism and Futurisms'', Thames and Hudson, 1986, p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters.  Major figures include [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Enrico Prampolini]], [[Gerardo Dottori]] and Crali. Crali continued to produce ''aeropittura'' up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including [[Art Deco]], [[Vorticism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and much later [[Neo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, Neo-Futurism. Published by: Architectural Association School of Architecture https://www.jstor.org/stable/29543561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pinkus, ''Self-Representation in NeoFuturism and Punk''. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press https://www.jstor.org/stable/3190376&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. [[Ridley Scott]] consciously evoked the designs of [[Antonio Sant'Elia|Sant'Elia]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his "dreamt-of metallization of the human body", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in [[manga]]/[[anime]] and the works of artists such as [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], director of the ''Tetsuo'' (lit. "Ironman") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the [[Internet]], such as [[Stelarc]] and [[Mariko Mori]], produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/18509/facts.yes_is_more_an_archicomic_on_architectural_evolution.htm Yes is More.

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the [[Neo-Futurist]] style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history |last1=Potter |first1=Janet |date=16 December 2013 |website=Reader |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurist ideas have been discerned in Western dance music since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1367-at-club-to-club-festival-dance-musics-growing-embrace-of-futurism-reigns/ At Club to Club Festival, Dance Music’s Growing Embrace of Futurism Reigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s 1986 album 'Futurista' was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track 'Variety Show'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/stranger-in-a-strange-world/1043 Ryuichi Sakamoto interview published ''Music Technology Magazine'' in August 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Italian director [[Marco Bellocchio]] included Futurist art in his feature film ''[[Vincere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MoMA {{!}} Finding The Robot|url = http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/02/06/finding-the-robot|website = www.moma.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] featured the exhibition "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/futurism/ "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe", Solomon R.

'''George Charles Williamson''' (1858–1942)&lt;ref name=met/&gt; was a British art historian, [[antiquarian]], and author of numerous books on European art and artists. He sometimes wrote under the pen name '''Rowley Cleeve'''.&lt;ref name=dlp/&gt;

==Biography==
Williamson wrote many books on European art and artists, focusing on the period from the Renaissance to the late 19th century. A number of these were issued as volumes in the publisher [[George Bell &amp; Sons]]' ''Miniature Series of Painters'', of which he was also the series editor.&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt; He wrote some of these under his real name and some under his 'Rowley Cleeve' pseudonym.&lt;ref name=dlp/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt;

He also wrote guides for art collectors on various topics—including several on [[portrait miniatures]]—and he assembled catalogues for collectors of art and antiques. For the American banker [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], he put together a four-volume catalogue of Morgan's collection of miniatures; a fifth volume was never completed due to Morgan's death.&lt;ref name=socialarchive/&gt; Williamson also served as an adviser to Morgan on some purchases for his collection.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

Williamson occasionally wrote on literary, historical, and cultural topics outside the field of art. Among these are ''Curious Survivals'', a book on English customs, and a book on the voyages of the Elizabethan naval commander [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].

Among Williamson' coauthored books is a study of the painter [[Angelica Kauffmann]], one of the founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (RA). ''Angelica Kauffmann, R.A.: Her Life and Her Works'', written with [[Lady Victoria Manners]], was prompted by the discovery in the RA archives of a manuscript in Kauffmann's handwriting, written in Italian and previously untranslated, which gives an account of Kauffmann's paintings post-1781.&lt;ref name=findlen/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; Manners and Williamson wrote that this enabled them to "come to certain definite conclusions regarding many pictures hitherto ascribed to other artists."&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; They included numerous reproductions in both colour and black-and-white on the grounds that prior books on Kauffman had presented inadequate reproductions of her paintings.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

A few of Williamson's papers from the period 1921–1937 are held by [[Boston College]].&lt;ref name=archivegrid/&gt;

==2011 winners==

Shree Bose, a 17-year-old girl in Texas, won the grand prize and $50,000 for her research on the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, that is commonly taken by women with ovarian cancer, tackling the problem of cancer cells growing resistant to cisplatin over time.

Naomi Shah of Portland, OR, won the age 15–16 category with a study of the effects of air quality on lungs, particularly for people who have asthma. Ms. Shah recruited 103 test subjects, performed 24-hour air quality measurements at their homes and workplaces and had each blow into a device that measured the force of their breath.

Lauren Hodge of York, PA, won the age 13–14 category for research on whether marinades reduce the amount of cancer-causing compounds produced by the grilling of [[meat]]. She found that [[lemon juice]] and brown sugar cut the level of carcinogens sharply, while [[soy sauce]] increased them.

People around the world (90 countries) had the opportunity to vote for their favorite projects in Google’s online voting gallery. Google has had more than 100,000 votes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/votes-are-in-for-google-science-fair.html |title= The Votes Are in for the Google Science Fair Finalists and People’s Choice Award Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the competition was really tight.  Nimal Subramanian won the People’s Choice Award for receiving the most among the 60 semi-finalists. The public really loved Nimal's project on Cancer Busters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN2R4wGHAao |title= Cancer Buster – Effect of Anti-Cancer Agents on In Vitro Germination and Protein Level (project video)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimal received a $10,000 scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/project-302852-science-irvine.html |title= Irvine Student Wins $10,000 Google Science Award|work= [[The Orange County Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016==

The 2016 Google Science Fair closed its entries on May 17, 2016, the Global 16 Finalist were announced on August 11, 2016. The final event took place during 24 to 27 September 2016 at Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Science Fair Awards Show 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSmqjtgkmo|website=You Tube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen finalists competed for top five awards. The first two rounds had two age groups 13-15 and 16-18. However, unlike previous years, top awards during the finalist event did not distinguish between the two age groups of the previous rounds, thus making it particularly challenging event for the contestant compared to all previous years.

The Grand Prize was won by [[Kiara Nirghin]] (16) of South Africa for her project 'Fighting Drought with Fruit'.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web|title= Combatting drought with a Low-Cost, biodegradable Superabsorbent Polymer made out of Orange Peels|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/deb654bce83b15eed364f52fa8685634649014602eca78858c58fec00aa6041a|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lego Education Builder award was won by Anushka Naiknaware (13) of United States, the youngest contestant to win a top award ever, for 'Smart Wound Care for the Future'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/562f25503d252660ac0e8309b7711f3fc2ef084c0fa3598a7a7cf9377fc8adaa|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic Explorer award was won by Mphatso Simbao (18) of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap production of nitrogen pesticides and fertilizers through hydrolysis of plant protein for rural use|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/ae920a381dfc15613b9d8f530d904301ef5b23158fd60c5dc33af8d7a6d98d98|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific American Innovator Award was won by a team of three for 'Fighting Foam Waste with Recycled Filters' from the US [Ashton (14), Luke (14) and Julia (14)].

'''Human ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in [[ecology]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], and [[home economics]], among others.

==Historical development==
{{more|History of ecology}}
The roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in [[natural history|natural history science]]. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huntignton00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huntington | first1=H.

Like other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from [[Carl Linnaeus]] where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, ''Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae'', Linnaeus developed a science that included the ''economy and polis of nature''. Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pearce | first1=T. | title=A great complication of circumstances | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | date=2010 | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=493–528 | doi=10.1007/s10739-009-9205-0 | pmid=20665080 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011216/http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | archivedate=2012-03-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher09"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kricher | first1=J. | title=The balance of nature: Ecology's enduring myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=252 | isbn=0-691-13898-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=G66yLaHLv2QC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Specimen+academicum+de+oeconomia+naturae+to+english#v=onepage&amp;q=Specimen%20academicum%20de%20oeconomia%20naturae&amp;f=false| date=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Egerton | first1=F.

Ecology is not just biological, but a human science as well.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was [[Herbert Spencer]]. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Catton94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Catton | first1=W.

In 1894, an influential [[Chicago school (sociology)|sociologist at the University of Chicago]] named [[Albion W. Small]], collaborated with sociologist [[George E. Vincent]] and published a "‘‘laboratory guide’’ to studying people in their ‘‘every-day occupations.’’"&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}} This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study [[society]] in a way that a [[natural history|natural historian]] would study birds. Their publication "explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment."&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}}

The first English-language use of the term "ecology" is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]. Richards first introduced the term as "[[oekology]]" in 1892, and subsequently developed the term "human ecology".&lt;ref name="Merchant2"/&gt;

The term "human ecology" was published in 1907 in [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] work "Sanitation in Daily Life", defined there as "the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Ellen H.|title=Sanitation in Daily Life|origyear=1907 |year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|asin=B008KX8KGA|pages=v.|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sanitation-Daily-Life-Classic-Reprint/dp/B008KX8KGA#reader_B008KX8KGA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature.&lt;ref name="Merchant2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=C.|title=American Environmental History: An Introduction|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231140355|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book "Introduction to the Science of Sociology",&lt;ref name="Park21"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Park | editor1-first=R.

Human ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines, including: home economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, zoology, and psychology.

Human ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology.&lt;ref name="Park36"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Park | first1=R. E. | date=1936 | title=Human ecology | journal=American Journal of Sociology | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=1–15 | jstor=2768859 | doi=10.1086/217327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward this aim, human ecologists (which can include [[sociologists]]) integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering "wider points of view".&lt;ref name="Borden08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Borden | first1=R.J | title=A brief history of SHE: Reflections on the founding and first twenty five years of the Society for Human Ecology | journal=Human Ecology Review | volume=15 | issue=1 | date=2008 | pages=95–108 | url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her151/borden.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} In its 1972 premier edition, the editors of ''[[Human Ecology (journal)|Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology.&lt;ref name="HEJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Editors | title=Introductory statement | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=1 | date=1972 | jstor=4602239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic:

* Genetic, physiological, and social adaptation to the environment and to environmental change;
* The role of social, cultural, and psychological factors in the maintenance or disruption of ecosystems;
* Effects of population density on health, social organization, or environmental quality;
* New adaptive problems in urban environments;
* Interrelations of technological and environmental changes;
* The development of unifying principles in the study of biological and cultural adaptation;
* The genesis of maladaptions in human biological and cultural evolution;
* The relation of food quality and quantity to physical and intellectual performance and to demographic change;
* The application of computers, remote sensing devices, and other new tools and techniques&lt;ref name="HEJ" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

Forty years later in the same journal, [[Daniel Bates|Daniel G. Bates]] (2012)&lt;ref name="Bates12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=D. G. | title=On forty years: Remarks from the editor | journal=Hum. Ecol. | volume=40 | issue=1 | pages=1–4 | doi=10.1007/s10745-012-9461-z| date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically “human ecology” model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.&lt;ref name="Bates12" /&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While theoretical discussions continue, research published in ''[[Human Ecology Review]]'' suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from [[Gerald L. Young]]'s idea of a "unified theory" of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by [[Paul Shepard]]: that human ecology is healthiest when "running out in all directions.".&lt;ref name="Shepard67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shepard | first1=P. | date=1967 | title=What ever happened to human ecology? | journal=BioScience | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=891–894 | jstor=1293928 | doi = 10.2307/1293928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over [[reductionism]], focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.

==Application to epidemiology and public health==
The application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come  into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Corwin EHL. Ecology of health. New York: Commonwealth Fund, 1949. Cited in le Riche WH, Milner J. Epidemiology as Medical Ecology.  Churchill Livingstone. Edinburgh and London. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Audy | first1 = JR. | date = 1958 | title = Medical ecology in relation to geography | journal = British Journal of Clinical Practice | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 102–110 | pmid = 13510527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was strengthened in 1971 by the publication of Epidemiology as Medical Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=le Riche|first1=W.

Ecohealth research in practice: Innovative Applications of an Ecosystem Approach to Health. Springer, IDRC 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health, human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=F |last1=White |first2=L |last2=Stallones |first3=JM. |last3=Last |title=Global Public Health: Ecological Foundations|date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-975190-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to home economics==
In addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current human ecology programs include [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]] and the University of Alberta's Department of Human Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Alberta Department of Human Ecology|url=http://www.hecol.ualberta.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Nature is a [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]] system. Ecosystems regenerate, withstand, and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments. Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time. However, persistent, systematic, large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings, habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth's ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including [[biodiversity loss]], [[climate change]], and [[nitrogen cycle]]s. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an [[Anthropocene]] epoch, where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity.&lt;ref name="Rockström09"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Rockström |first = W. |last2 = Noone |first2 = K. |last3=Persson| first3=A. | last4=Chapin| first4=S. | last5=Lambin | first5=E.

[[Ecological economics]] is an [[economics|economic science]] that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss.&lt;ref name="de Groot02" /&gt; Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities.&lt;ref name="Costanza97"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Costanza, R. |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |date=1997 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |ref=harv |issue=6630 |display-authors=1 |last2=d'Arge |first2=Ralph |last3=De Groot |first3=Rudolf |last4=Farber |first4=Stephen |last5=Grasso |first5=Monica |last6=Hannon |first6=Bruce |last7=Limburg |first7=Karin |last8=Naeem |first8=Shahid |last9=O'Neill |first9=Robert V. |last10=Paruelo |first10=Jose |last11=Raskin |first11=Robert G. |last12=Sutton |first12=Paul |last13=Van Den Belt |first13=Marjan |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226124242/http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services.

The work of [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the “household of man” and the “household of nature” could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1950. ''An Ecological Introduction''.  In A Reconstruction of Economics, Wiley, New York. pp. 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1966. ''Economics and Ecology''.

==Interdisciplinary approaches==
{{quote box
| quote =
Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bio-ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bio-ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}
| width = 30%
| align = right}}

Human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People's perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: "think global, act local." Moreover, people's conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from "community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;

In these early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07" /&gt;

===In art===

While some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. [[Bill Carpenter (writer)|Bill Carpenter]] (1986) calls human ecology the "possibility of an aesthetic science," renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, B. 1986. ''Human Ecology: The Possibility of an Aesthetic Science''. Paper presented at the Society for Human Ecology conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===

While the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary and secondary education levels. Educational theorist Sir [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Kenneth Robinson]] has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e.- educate their “whole being”) activities to implement a “new conception of human ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K. 2006. TED Talk, http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioregionalism and urban ecology==
{{main article|Bioregionalism}}
{{see also|Urban ecology}}

In the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[planning]]. [[Ian McHarg]] called for a future when all planning would be “human ecological planning” by default, always bound up in humans’ relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the “layers” of information from [[geology]] to [[botany]] to zoology to [[cultural history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McHarg | first1 = I. | date = 1981 | title = Ecological Planning at Pennsylvania | url = | journal = Landscape Planning | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 109–120 | doi=10.1016/0304-3924(81)90029-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the [[new urbanism]] movement, like [[James Howard Kunstler]] and [[Andres Duany]], have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be "the agenda for the years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;In Kunstler, J.H. 1994. ''The Geography of Nowhere''. New York:Touchstone. pp.260&lt;/ref&gt; While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the [[landscape urbanism]] movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations.  Among these theorists is [[Frederich Steiner]], who published ''Human Ecology: Following Nature's Lead'' in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology.  While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and [[political geography]]. [[Deiter Steiner]]'s 2003 ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary'' view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology.  Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: "human ecology", "the implicit and the explicit", "structuration", and "the regional dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, D. and M. Nauser (eds.). 1993. ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary Views of the World.'' London and New York: Routledge. Human Ecology Forum 108 ''Human Ecology Review'', 2008; Vol. 15, No. 1,&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.

The '''Institut Jean Nicod''' (also known as '''IJN''') is a [[CNRS]] research center based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Founded in 2000, its name commemorates the French philosopher, [[mathematician]] and logician [[Jean Nicod]] (1893-1924). At present, the Institute is co-hosted by the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], two prestigious French institutions for [[research]] and [[higher education]]. Research carried by its members has a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] profile, at the interface between  [[cognitive science]] and the [[social sciences]]. The main scientific fields covered by the Institute include: [[neuroscience]] [[linguistics]] ([[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]), [[cognitive anthropology]] and [[philosophy of mind]]. Although most members of the group are logicians, the issues addressed are not purely conceptual and have a strong empirical component. For several years, members of the Institute have led research projects in collaboration with cognitive neurobiologists, developmental psychologists, neuropsychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. 

The Jean Nicod Institute was the first French institution (and among the first in Europe) in the field of science and social sciences to embrace an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] policy with respect to its scientific production, providing free and unconstrained access to the totality of its publications. The Institute hosts two [[academic journal]]s, the ''[[European Review of Philosophy]]'' ([[CSLI Publications]], 1994-2006) and the ''[[Review of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2010-), as well as the [[Jean Nicod Prize|Jean Nicod Lectures]] series ([[MIT Press]], 1995-). Every year, the IJN website provides information on the [[Jean Nicod Prize]], awarded by the French [[CNRS]]  to a leading [[Philosophy of mind|philosopher of mind]] or philosophically oriented [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]].

{{about|the book by [[Amanda Petrusich]]||It Still Moves (disambiguation)}}
'''''It Still Moves: Lost Songs, Lost Highways, and the Search for the Next American Music''''' is a 2008 book by American music journalist [[Amanda Petrusich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Jonathan|title=It Still Moves: Lost Songs, Lost Highways and the Search for the Next American Music|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/68570532-d937-11dd-ab5f-000077b07658.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4m0LhxC00|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=Financial Times|date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Publication ==
The project originated in a piece for [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste Magazine'']], where Petrusich served as senior contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/08/amanda-petrusich.html|title=Amanda Petrusich: It Still Moves: Lost Songs, Lost Highways, and the Search for the Next American Music|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|date=August 21, 2008|work=Paste Magazine|access-date=2017-07-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published the 272-page book with [[Faber &amp; Faber]] on August 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IT STILL MOVES by Amanda Petrusich|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/amanda-petrusich/it-still-moves/|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=June 1, 2008|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Joe Boyd described the book as "a terrific piece of travel writing" and "a tour through the roots of American rural music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/24/amanda-petrusich-music-travel-review|title=American beauty|date=23 January 2009|work=The Guardian|last1=Boyd|first1=Joe|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrusich investigates on the influence of blues on later genres of popular music, beginning with the work of [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Alan Lomax]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', John S.W. MacDonald described the project as "show[ing] us what the current indie-folk scene and its record-collecting twenty- and thirtysomethings...have to do with classic American folk: what bands like [[In the Reins|Iron and Wine]] and [[Califone]] have inherited from that tradition and what they’ve thrown away. To do all this, [Petrusich] hit the road, heading south in her beat-up Honda Civic to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Appalachia]] to find the seeds of folk and the birthplace of rock 'n' roll."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/08/19/the-new-weird-america-of-amanda-petrusichs-it-still-moves/|title=The New Weird America of Amanda Petrusich’s It Still Moves|date=August 19, 2008|work=The Village Voice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=MacDonald|first1=John S.W.|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reception==
Reviewing ''It Still Moves'' for [[PopMatters]], Derek Beres describes Petrusich as "a passionate writer whose love for music shines through on every page. As she explains early on, she is not concerned with how many records are sold or what tactics artists use in the studio. Her approach is more intangible, hence more emotionally tactile: Who are these people creating this music? What are their dreams, ambitions, philosophies?...This is, in large part, what makes this book so enjoyable—the people behind the songs, not to mention her own personal perceptions of what goes on behind her scenes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/it-still-moves-by-amanda-petrusich/|title=It Still Moves by Amanda Petrusich|last=Beres|first=Derek|date=29 October 2008|work=PopMatters|access-date=2017-07-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karen Burns''' (born 1962) is an architectural historian and theorist based in [[Melbourne]], Australia.  She is currently a senior lecturer in architecture at the Melbourne School of Design, [[University of Melbourne]].

== Early years and education ==
Born in January 1962, Burns grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Beaumaris, Victoria|Beaumaris]]. Her feminist activism first found expression in 1978 when she worked as a volunteer at a newly established refuge for women and children escaping family violence.

Burns studied English literature and art history at [[Monash University]], the latter with [[Patrick McCaughey]] and Conrad Hamann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/vic-citations/conrad_hamann_citation.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title = Citation For Honorary Fellow – Conrad Hamann|date = |accessdate = 11 October 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Australian Institute of Architects|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was Hamann’s first honours student. Burns graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (hons) in 1984 and a Master of Arts in 1987. She began studying architecture at [[RMIT University]] in 1986, and began editing the magazine ''Transition'' the same year. Her PhD, "Urban Tourism, 1851-53: sightseeing, representation and ''The Stones of Venice''" was completed in 1999 at the School of Fine Arts, Classical Studies and Archaeology, University of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/36040|title = Urban tourism, 1851-53: sightseeing, representation and the Stones of Venice|date = 1999|accessdate = |website = Minerva access|publisher = University of Melbourne|last = Burns|first = Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Burns has held academic positions at a number of universities in Melbourne. She began her academic career at RMIT University (1986–1995) and then joined the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of Arts|Department of English and Cultural Studies]] and Department of Fine Arts, Classics and Archaeology, University of Melbourne (1997–1999, 2001). She spent three years at the Centre for Ideas, [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] (2002–2004), of which she was Acting Director in 2002–2003. She joined the new Department of Architecture at [[Monash University]] in 2008 and was later appointed as a Senior Lecturer in Architecture at the Melbourne School of Design, University of Melbourne, a position she still holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lunchtime Art Forum - Dr Karen Burns (Monash University) Research in Architecture, Monash University|url = http://monash.edu/news/events/show/lunchtime-art-forum-dr-karen-burns-monash-university-research-in|website = monash.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DR KAREN BURNS - The University of Melbourne|url = http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person15488|website = www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Melbourne School of Design {{!}} University of Melbourne {{!}} Dr Karen Burns|url = https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/people/karen-burns|website = Melbourne School of Design|accessdate = 2015-10-11|first = Melbourne School of Design {{!}} University of|last = Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her academic research focuses on three principal areas: Australian frontier housing and problems of interpretation, late-twentieth-century feminist architectural history and theory, and alliances between architects, aesthetics and manufacturers in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. In relation to the last topic she is working on a book titled ''Object Lessons: Demonstrating Victorian Design Reform, 1835–1870.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DR KAREN BURNS - The University of Melbourne|url = http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person15488#tab-overview|website = www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was an active researcher on the [[Australian Research Council]] funded project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architectural Profession: women, work and leadership (2011-2014), which was led by [[Naomi Stead]] of the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership - UQ Researchers|url = http://researchers.uq.edu.au/research-project/12113|website = researchers.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its key outcomes was [[Parlour: women, equity, architecture]]. Burns was instrumental in establishing this organisation with colleagues from the research project, and was responsible for coining the name Parlour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in the context of her long engagement in feminist and social activism in architecture.

Burns' has given invited keynote presentations at three conferences: ''Fabulations,'' the Annual Conference of [[SAHANZ]], [[University of Tasmania]], July 2012; ''Interstices'', University of Tasmania, November 2011; Whirlwinds Symposium, ''Sexuate Subjects: Politics, Poetics and Ethics'', [[The Bartlett|Bartlett School of Architecture]], [[University College London]], December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Confirmed Invited Speakers|url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sexuate-subjects/keynotespeakers|website = www.ucl.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2011 Interstices Under Construction Symposium: Technics, Memory and the Architecture of History - Events|url = http://www.events.utas.edu.au/2011/november/2011-interstices-under-construction-symposium-technics,-memory-and-the-architecture-of-history|website = www.events.utas.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SAHANZ Conferences|url = http://www.sahanz.net/conferences/|website = www.sahanz.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Update: Technics, Memory and the Architecture of History|url = https://intersticesjournal.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/update-technics-memory-and-the-architecture-of-history/|website = Interstices: Journal of Architecture and Related Arts|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has presented her research work at many more conferences and symposia and is an active member of the academic community.

== Editorial work and architectural criticism ==
Burns has played important roles in a range of publications, both scholarly and professional, as editor, contributor and advisor.

=== ''Transition: Discourse on Architecture'' ===

She was editor of ''[[Transition: Discourse on Architecture]]'', an influential&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; quarterly journal published by RMIT University, from July 1986 – December 1991. This saw her edit 17 issues of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transition (Collingwood, Vic.) - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/44725233|website = trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1987, this was an editorial partnership with [[Harriet Edquist]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sahanz2015.be.unsw.edu.au/papers/Sawyer_Call-and-Response.pdf|title = Call-and-Response: Group Formation and Agency enacted through an Architectural Magazine, its Letters and Editorials|last = Sawyer|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Architecture Institutions and Change, Proceedings of SAHANZ |volume=32|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |isbn = 978 0 646 94298 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Companion City {{!}} ACCA|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/exhibition/companion-city|website = www.accaonline.org.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the journal over this period include:
* no. 25 (1988) ''Women &amp; Architecture'' 
* no. 26 (1988) ''The Bicentennial Issue'' 
* no. 27/28 (1989) ''New Urbanism'', which included a 25-page review of the New Parliament House by [[James Weirick]]. 
Transition was also a vehicle for exhibitions and competitions, including:
* 1991 ''Transition Companion City Competition''. The competition "explored the future for our cities through ideas of design, energy conservation, planning and the environment" and also resulted in exhibition at [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA) curated by Burns and Edquist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/sites/default/files/1991_Transition%2C%20Companion%20City%20Forum%20review.pdf|title = Companion City Forum at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art|last = London|first = Geoffrey|date = 1995|journal = Transition: Discourse on Architecture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/sites/default/files/1991_30%20March_The%20Age%2C%20A%20wild%20ride%20for%20planning%20theory.pdf|title = A Wild Ride for Planning Theory|last = Stephens|first = John|date = 30 March 1991|work = The Age|access-date = 11 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1989 Transition 10th Anniversary Conference. This focussed on the topic ''[[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]', the Architect as Critic'', and was accompanied by a tour of Boyd's houses and an exhibition (curated with [[Philip Goad]]) of Boyd's publications at the State Library of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robin Boyd : the architect as critic : an exhibition at the La Trobe Library of Victoria, 1989 / [editors: Karen Burns, Harriet Edquist]. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/209616773|website = trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference papers were published together with Boyd's catalgoue raisonnee in 1992.

=== ''Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Art'' ===

== Activism and public engagement ==
Burns has a long history of involvement with feminist activism and social justice issues in architecture. She is a founding member of the Melbourne-based organisation E1027: Women in Architecture (1990) – established with [[Harriet Edquist]] and others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = E1027: from Modernist House to Feminist Collective|last = Burns|first = Karen|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4438-4027-9|location = Cambridge|pages = |editor-last = Edquist|editor-first = Harriet|chapter = |work = The Design Collective: An Approach to Practice|editor-link = Harriet Edquist|editor-last2 = Vaughan|editor-first2 = Laurene}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the organisation had 80 members, including  architects [[Maggie Edmond]], [[Anne Cunningham]], [[Ann Keddie]], Mary Ruth Sindrey, Val Austin, [[Suzanne Dance]], [[Eli Giannini]], Mardi Butcher, [[Jill Garner]] and Anna Ely. Members also included women artists such as Kathy Temin, Sarah Curtis, Lauren Berkowitz and Jan Nelson.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = E1027 Women’s Architecture Collaborative - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/e1027/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Burns|first = Karen|date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Burns curated the exhibition ''Insight Out'' with Anna Horne.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Insight/ Out. Exhibition at the 200 Gertrude Street Gallery, 3-25 July 1992|last = Hennessy|first = Peter|date = 1992|journal = Transition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Piccinini|first2 = Patricia|issue = 39|pages = 68–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took the form of architectural installations at 200 Gertrude Street and five other outdoor sites in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], Melbourne. The exhibition examined urban change, gentrification, housing stress and historical memory.

In 2013 Burns played a key role in establishing Parlour: women, equity, architecture, with [[Justine Clark]], [[Naomi Stead]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome to Parlour - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Justine Clark &amp; Dr Karen Burns, Parlour {{!}} Australian Design Review|url = http://www.australiandesignreview.com/features/27445-interview-justine-clark-dr-karen-burns-parlour|website = www.australiandesignreview.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Tweeddale|first = Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed as a "space to speak" for women in architecture, this provides research, resources and informed opinion about gender equity and architecture. Writing by Burns on Parlour includes:
* Who Wants to be a Woman Architect?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who wants to be a Woman Architect? - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/who-wants-to-be-a-woman-architect/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parlour also ran the 2012 symposium, Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture, which was co-convened by Burns with colleagues Justine Clark and Naomi Stead and hosted by the University of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/transform/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/transform-altering-the-future-of-architecture-1/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Kalms|first = Niki|publisher = Architecture Media|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

In [[music cognition]], '''melodic fission''' (also known as '''melodic''' or '''auditory streaming''', or '''stream segregation'''), is a  phenomenon in which one line of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (an auditory stream) is heard as two or more separate melodic lines.  This occurs when a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] contains groups of pitches at two or more distinct [[register (music)|registers]] or with two or more distinct [[timbre]]s.

The term appears to stem from a 1973 paper by W. J. Dowling.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Dowling (1973), "The perception of interleaved melodies", ''Cognitive Psychology'' 5, pp. 322-337. A. S. Bregman &amp; J. Campbell (1971), "Primary auditory stream segregation and perception of order in rapid sequences of tones", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' 89, pp. 244-249, had spoken of "auditory stream segregation".&lt;/ref&gt; In [[music analysis]] and, more specifically, in [[Schenkerian analysis]], the phenomenon more often is termed [[Unfolding (music)|compound melody]].&lt;ref&gt;The term appears to have been coined by Walter Piston (1947), ''Counterpoint'', New York, Norton, under the form "compound melodic line" (London edition, 1947, p. 23). In the context of Schenkerian analysis, see for instance Forte &amp; Gilbert (1982), ''Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis'', Chapter 3, pp. 67-80. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#Unfolding|Schenkerian analysis]]. Manfred Bukofzer (1947), ''Music in the Baroque Era'', New York, Norton, had spoken of "implied polyphony".&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychophysics]], [[auditory scene analysis]] is the process by which the brain separates and organizes sounds into perceptually distinct groups, known as auditory streams.

The counterpart to melodic fission is '''melodic fusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;Saighoe, Francis.  "Resultant Melodies: A Psycho-Structural Analysis".  Journal of the Ghana Teacher's Association, 1991, Vol. 1, pp. 30-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==

===Register===

Listeners tend to perceive fast melodic sequences which contain tones from two different registers as two melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Deutsch, Diana | title = Psychology of Music | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | location = St. Louis, Missouri | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the distance between groups of tones in a melody, the more likely they will be heard as two different and interrupted streams instead of one continuous stream.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, W. J.  "The Perception of Interleaved Melodies".  Cognitive Psychology, 1973, Vol. 5, 322-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, W.J., Lung, K.M., and Herrbold, S.,  "Aiming Attention in Pitch and Time in the Perception of Interleaved Melodies".  Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 1987, Vol. 41, 642-656&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies involving the interleaving of two melodies have found that the closer the melodies are in register, the more difficult it is for listeners to perceptually separate the melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bey, C, and McAdams, S.  "Postrecognition of Interleaved Melodies as an Indirect Measure of Auditory Stream Formation".  Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2003, Vol. 29, 267-279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tempo is important, as the threshold for registral distance between melodic phrases still perceived as one stream increases as the tempo of the melody decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Van Noorden, Leo | title = Temporal Coherence in the Perception of Tone Sequences | publisher = [[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]] | location = The Netherlands | year = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timbre===

The more distinct the timbre of groups of pitches within one stream, the greater the likelihood that listeners will separate them into different streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wessel|first=David|title=Timbre Space as a Musical Control Structure|journal=Computer Music Journal|year=1979|volume=3|pages=45–52|doi=10.2307/3680283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to results found with experiments in pitch level, slower tempos increase the chance of perception of timbrally distinct pitches as one continuous stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=R. M.|author2=Obusek, C. J. |author3=Farmer, R. M. |author4=Warren, R. P. |title=Auditory Sequence: Confusion of Patterns Other than Speech or Music|journal=Science|year=1969|volume=164|pages=586–587|doi=10.1126/science.164.3879.586}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Timbral difference may override registral similarity in the perception of segregated streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Deutsch, Diana | title = Psychology of Music | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | location = St. Louis, Missouri | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, quick and contrasting [[Perceptual attack time|attack times]] in groups of tones lead to fission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iverson|first=P.|title=Auditory Stream Segregation by Music Timbre: Effects of Static and Dynamic Acoustic Attributes|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1995|volume=21|pages=751–763|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.4.751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume===

Differences in volume of groups of pitches can also lead to stream segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, W. J.  "The Perception of Interleaved Melodies".  Cognitive Psychology, 1973, Vol. 5, 322-337.&lt;/ref&gt;  Logically, the louder the volume of group of tones, the greater likelihood of melodic fission.  In addition, when two streams are perceptually segregated due to differences in volume, the quieter stream is perceived as continuous, but interrupted by the louder stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Van Noorden, Leon | title = Temporal Coherence in the Perception of Tone Sequences | publisher = [[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]] | location = The Netherlands | year = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetition===

Perception of separate streams builds as the melodic sequence is repeated over time, first rapidly, and then at a decreased rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anstis|first=S. M.|author2=Saida, S.|title=Adaptation to Auditory Streaming of Frequency Modulated Tones|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1985|volume=11|pages=257–271|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.11.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a few factors can impede this process and "reset" fission perception, including silence between presentation of the melody,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beavois|first=M. W.|author2=Meddis, R.|title=Time Decay of Auditory Stream Biasing|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1997|volume=59|pages=81–86|doi=10.3758/bf03206850}}&lt;/ref&gt; alteration of signal location (right or left ear) of the melody, and abrupt changes in volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anstis|first=S. M.|author2=Saida, S.|title=Adaptation to Auditory Streaming of Frequency Modulated Tones|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1985|volume=11|pages=257–271|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.11.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=W.

[[Image:Delaunay-Windows.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]]]]
'''Orphism''' or '''Orphic Cubism''', a term coined by the French [[poetry|poet]] [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in 1912, was an offshoot of [[Cubism]] that focused on pure [[abstraction]] and bright colors, influenced by [[Fauvism]], the theoretical writings of [[Paul Signac]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] and the dye chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Eugène Chevreul]]. This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to [[Abstract art]], was pioneered by [[František Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]], who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/orphism Tate Glossary] retrieved 31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hajo Düchting, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:František Kupka - Katedrála - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|[[František Kupka]], ''[[The Cathedral (Katedrála)|Katedrála (The Cathedral)]]'', 1912-13, oil on canvas, 180 x 150 cm, [[Museum Kampa]], [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
The Orphists were rooted in [[Cubism]] but moved toward a pure [[lyrical abstraction]], seeing painting as the bringing together of a sensation of pure colors. More concerned with the expression and significance of sensation, this movement began with recognizable subjects but was rapidly absorbed by increasingly abstract structures. Orphism aimed to dispense with recognizable subject matter and to rely on ''form'' and ''color'' to communicate meaning. The movement also aimed to express the ideals of Simultanism: the existence of an infinitude of interrelated states of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/simultanism Tate glossary] Retrieved December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of spectral light expressed in [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] played an important role in the formulation of Orphism. [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]], and [[Gino Severini]], all knew Henry personally.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Henry, a mathematician, inventor, esthetician, and intimate friend of the Symbolist writers [[Félix Fénéon]] and [[Gustave Kahn]], met [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], Signac and [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] during the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Henry would take the final step in bringing ''emotional associational theory'' into the world of artistic sensation: something that would influence greatly the Neo-Impressionists. Henry and Seurat were in agreement that the basic elements of art—the line, particle of color, like words—could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. "Seurat knows well" wrote Fénéton in 1889, "that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value" in addition, of course, to the particles of color, and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by the likes of Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt; Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis for their painting in the domain of color. The Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics, and the Orphists would do so with color too.

The Symbolists had used the word ''orphique'' in relation to the Greek myth of [[Orpheus]], who they perceived as the ideal artist. Apollinaire had written a collection of quatrains in 1907 entitled ''Bestiaire ou cortège d’Orphée'' (Paris, 1911), within which Orpheus was symbolized as a poet and artist. For both Apollinaire and the Symbolists who preceded him, Orpheus was associated with [[mysticism]], something that would inspire artistic endeavors. ''The voice of light'' that Apollinaire mentioned in his poems was a metaphor for ''inner experiences''. Though not fully articulated in his poems, ''the voice of light'' is identified as a line that could be colored and become a painting. The Orphic metaphor thus represented the artist’s power to create new structures and color harmonies, in an innovative creative process that combined to form a sensuous experience.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==Guillaume Apollinaire==
[[File:Sonia Delaunay, 1914, Prismes électriques, oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Sonia Delaunay]], 1914, ''Prismes électriques'', oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]
The term Orphism was coined by poet and art critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cubist_Painters.html?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Cubist Painters (Les Peintres Cubistes: Méditations esthétiques)'', Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, translation by Peter Read, University of California Press, 25 oct. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature. Orphic painters cited analogies with music in their titles; for example, Kupka’s ''Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colors'' (1912) and [[Francis Picabia]]’s abstract composition ''Dance at the Source'' (1912) and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]’s ''Über das Geistige in der Kunst'' (1912). Kandinsky's detailed theoretical essays described the correlations between color and sound. Robert Delaunay, also preoccupied with relations between color and music, highlighted the purity and independence of color, and successfully exhibited with the [[Blaue Reiter]] at the invitation of Kandinsky. [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], as they tended towards abstraction, were also included as Orphists in the writings of Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Apollinaire stayed with the Delaunays during the winter of 1912, becoming close friends and elaborating on many ideas. Apollinaire wrote several texts discussing their work to promote the concept of Orphism. In March 1913 Orphism was exhibited to the public at the Salon des Indépendants. In his review of the Salon published in ''L’Intransigeant'' (25 March 1913), Apollinaire wrote that ‘it combines painters of totally different characters, all of whom have nonetheless achieved a more internalized, more popular and more poetic vision of the universe and of life’. And in ''Montjoie'' (29 March 1913) Apollinaire argued for the abolition of Cubism in favour of Orphism: ‘If Cubism is dead, long live Cubism. The kingdom of Orpheus is at hand!’

The Herbst salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin) of 1913, organized by [[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]], exhibited many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Jean Metzinger]]’s ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' (1913, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), [[Albert Gleizes]]' ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]'' (1912-13, National Gallery of Art), paintings by Picabia, and Léger, along with several Futurist paintings. This exhibition marked a turning-point in Apollinaire’s relation with R. Delaunay (which would cool markedly), following some remarks in an argument with [[Umberto Boccioni]] about the ambiguity of the term ‘simultaneity’.  This would be the last time Apollinaire used the term Orphism in his critical analyses of art; as he turned his attention increasingly towards Picabia and [[Alexander Archipenko]], but most of all towards the Futurists.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==The Delaunays==
[[Sonia Terk Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], a husband and wife duo, were to become the main protagonists of the Orphic movement, Robert Delaunay also studied different styles of painting, such as Abstract Art. In their earlier works, their styles focused on Fauvist colors with various degrees of abstraction; particularly evident in Sonia's ''Finnish Girl'' (1907) and Robert's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906). The former painting relies heavily on bright colors and smooth transitions between forms, while the latter relies on color and mosaic-like brushstrokes painted under the influence of Jean Metzinger, also a Neo-Impressionist (with highly [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] and [[Fauvism|Fauve]] components) at the time.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Their works became increasingly identifiable by the 'simultaneous' contrasting of colors and the tendency towards non-representation. In Robert's ''Eiffel Tower Series'', the subject is portrayed as if seen from several viewpoints at once; employing the concept of 'mobile perspective' developed by his close friend Metzinger. Soon, instead of using muted tones as the Cubists, he would paint with bold, bright colors juxtaposed one next to the other (a concept derived from [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory). He often portrayed the tower with reds and pinks with cooler colors throughout. The more Robert painted the tower, the more abstract, fragmented and colorful it became.

In 1913 the Delaunays showed their works in the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the Herbst Salon, the latter being the first Orphist Salon, which also hosted works by [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], and [[Futurism|Futurist]] painters. Unlike others associated with Orphism, the Delaunays would return to this style throughout their lives.

==Eugène Chevreul==
[[Image:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|right|The last section of ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'', 1913, a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]].]]
One of Robert's biggest influences, besides his wife, was the chemist [[Eugène Chevreul]]. Most famous for discovering [[margarine]], Chevreul delved in dye chemistry as well as the aesthetics of [[contrast effect|simultaneous contrast]] of colors. He had three main ideas to his color theories: "when complementary colors are juxtaposed, each appears to be more intense than when seen in isolation" and "if there is a perceptible difference in dark-light value between the two colors, then the darker will appear to be even darker" as well as that "all colors present in the field of vision at the same time mutually modify one another in specific ways". Chevreul influenced many artists because he understood scientifically what many artists expressed instinctively.

==After 1913==
Even after Apollinaire had separated from the Delaunays and Orphism had lost its novelty as a new art form, the Delaunays continued painting in their personal shared style. They may not have always called their work Orphic, but the aesthetics and theories were the same. Robert continued painting while Sonia delved into other media, including fashion, interior and textile design, all within the realm of Orphism.

==Legacy==
Orphism as a movement was short-lived, essentially coming to an end before [[World War I]]. In spite of the use of the term the works categorized as Orphism were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Artists intermittently referred to as Orphists by Apollinaire, such as Léger, Picabia, Duchamp and Picasso, independently created new categories that could hardly be classified as Orphic. The term Orphism most obviously embraced paintings by František Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, if limited to implications imposed by color, light, and the expression of non-representational compositions. Even Robert Delaunay thought this description misrepresented his intentions, though his temporary classification as Orphic had proved successful. The American painters [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]], two of Delaunay’s pupils, strove to create a similar art-form circa 1912. The [[Synchromism|Synchromists]] [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] wrote their own manifestos in an attempt to distance themselves from the Orphism of Robert Delaunay, but their art at times inevitably appeared Orphic. Essentially a stylistic sub-category of [[Abstract art]] created by Apollinaire, Orphism was an elusive term from which artists included within its scope persistently attempted to detach themselves.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

'''[[Packaging]] engineering''', also '''package engineering''', '''packaging technology''' and '''packaging science''', is a broad topic ranging from design conceptualization to product placement.  All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product.  Package engineering includes industry-specific aspects of [[industrial engineering]],  [[marketing]],  [[materials science]], [[industrial design]] and [[logistics]].  Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on.  The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;).  Packaging involves [[extrusion]], [[thermoforming]], [[molding (process)|molding]] and other processing technologies.  Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment.  Packaging engineers use principles of [[structural analysis]] and [[thermal analysis]] in their evaluations.

==Education==
Some [[packaging]] engineers have backgrounds in other [[science]], [[engineering]], or [[design]] disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packworld.com/schools|title=Packaging Directory-Packaging Schools|access-date=14 Feb 2015 |last= |first= |publisher=Packaging  world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc.  BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available.  Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as [[shelf life]] stability, [[corrugated box design]], [[cushioning]], [[engineering design]], labeling regulations,  [[project management]], [[food safety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun|authorlink= |author2=Kim, An |author3=Lyu, Lee|date=November 1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |pages= 417–423|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robotics]], [[RFID]] tags, [[quality management]], [[package testing]], packaging machinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braglia|first= Maracello|authorlink= |author2=Frosolini, Montanari|date=January 2003 |title=Fuzzy logic controller in a packaging plant|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–45 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first= A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11459">The field of '''population informatics''' is the systematic study of populations via secondary analysis of massive data collections (termed "[[big data]]") about people.  Scientists in the field refer to this massive data collection as the [[social genome]], denoting the collective [[digital footprint]] of our society.  Population informatics applies [[data science]] to social genome data to answer fundamental questions about human society and population health much like [[bioinformatics]] applies data science to [[human genome]] data to answer questions about individual health. It is an emerging research area at the intersection of SBEH (Social, Behavioral, Economic, &amp; Health) sciences, computer science, and statistics in which quantitative methods and computational tools are used to answer fundamental questions about our society.

== Introduction ==

=== History ===
The term was first used in August 2012 when the [http://research.tamhsc.edu/pinformatics/about-us/#history Population Informatics Research Group] was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The term was first defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Privacy-by-Design: Understanding Data Access Models for Secondary Data|journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings AMIA Summit on Translational Science|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2153-4063|pmc = 3845756|pmid = 24303251|pages = 126–130|volume = 2013|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = Stanley|last2 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated on in another article in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Genome: Putting Big Data to Work for Population Informatics|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678338&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fiel7%252F2%252F5306045%252F06678338.pdf%253Farnumber%253D6678338|journal = Computer|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 56–63|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/MC.2013.405|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = A.|last2 = Krishnamurthy|first3 = A.|last3 = Machanavajjhala|first4 = S.C.|last4 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [http://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in August 2015.

=== Goals ===
To study social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences using the massive data collections, aka [[social genome]] data, about people.  The primary goal of population informatics is to increase the understanding of social processes by developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to the [[social genome]] data.

Some of the important sub-disciplines are :
* [[Business analytics]]
* [[Social computing]]: social network data analysis
* Policy informatics
* [[Public health informatics]] 
* [[Computational journalism]]
* [[Computational transportation science]]
* [[Computational epidemiology]]
* [[Computational economics]]
* [[Computational sociology]]
* [[Computational social science]]

=== Approaches ===
[[Record linkage|Record Linkage]], the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources, is a major activity in the population informatics field because most of the digital traces about people are fragmented in many heterogeneous databases that need to be linked before analysis can be done.

Once relevant datasets are linked, the next task is usually to develop valid meaningful measures  to answer the research question.  Often developing measures involves iterating between inductive and deductive approaches with the data and research question until usable measures are developed because the data were collected for other purposes with no intended use to answer the question at hand.  Developing meaningful and useful measures from existing data is a major challenge in many research projects.  In computation fields, these measures are often called features.

Finally, with the datasets linked and required measures developed, the analytic dataset is ready for analysis.  Common analysis methods include traditional hypothesis driven research as well more inductive approaches such as [[data science]] and [[predictive analytics]].

=== Relation to other fields ===
[[Computational social science]] refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include [[computational economics]] and [[computational sociology]].  The seminal article on computational social science is by Lazer et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|journal = Science |date = 2009-02-06|issn = 0036-8075|pmc = 2745217|pmid = 19197046|pages = 721–723|volume = 323|issue = 5915|doi = 10.1126/science.1167742|first = David|last = Lazer|first2 = Alex (Sandy)|last2 = Pentland|first3 = Lada|last3 = Adamic|first4 = Sinan|last4 = Aral|first5 = Albert Laszlo|last5 = Barabasi|first6 = Devon|last6 = Brewer|first7 = Nicholas|last7 = Christakis|first8 = Noshir|last8 = Contractor|first9 = James|last9 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a summary of a workshop held at Harvard with the same title.  However, the article does not define the term computational social science precisely.

In general, computational social science is a broader field and encompasses population informatics.  Besides population informatics, it also includes complex [[simulation]]s of social phenomena.  Often complex simulation models use results from population informatics to configure with real world parameters.

Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) is another similar field coming about.  But again, DSSG is a bigger field applying data science to any social problem that includes study of human populations but also many problems that do not use any data about people.

Population reconstruction is the multi-disciplinary field to reconstruct specific (historical) populations by linking data from diverse sources, leading to rich novel resources for study by social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Population Reconstruction - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|last = Bloothooft|first = G.|last2 = Christen|first2 = P.|last3 = Mandemakers|first3 = K.|last4 = Schraagen|first4 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related groups and workshops ===
The first [https://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. The workshop brought together computer science researchers, as well as public health practitioners and researchers.  This Wikipedia page started at the workshop.

The [http://www.ipdln.org/ International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN)] facilitates communication between centres that specialize in data linkage and users of the linked data. The producers and users alike are committed to the systematic application of data linkage to produce community benefit in the population and health-related domains.

=== Challenges ===
Three major challenges specific to population informatics are: 
# Preserving privacy of the subjects of the data – due to increasing concerns of privacy and confidentiality sharing or exchanging sensitive data about the subjects across different organizations is often not allowed. Therefore, population informatics need to be applied on encrypted data or in a privacy-preserving setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinusha Vatsalan, Peter Christen, and Vassilios S.

'''Rawinala''' is one of MDVI (Multiple Disability and Visual Impairment) school recognized throughout Indonesia for helping student with multiple disabilities such as [[mental retardation]], physical and multiple disabilities, [[visual impairment]], [[Developmental psychology|Development Disorder]], [[Hearing impairment]]. 

==History==
The school was founded in 1973 by a group of GKJ church community. With 2 students in 1973, currently they have 65 students, from ages 2 to 40 with 70 full employees. Located in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], Rawinala has six unit programs which are "G" Type Special Learning, [[Deafblindness]] Service Training, Early Service Unit, Workshop Unit, [[Dormitory]] Unit, and Family Counseling Unit.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Serendipity''' means an unplanned, fortunate  discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serendipity|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/serendipity|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford dictionary|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of scientific innovation. Examples are [[Alexander Fleming]]'s accidental discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928, the invention of the [[microwave oven]] by Percy Spencer  in 1945, and the invention of the [[Post-it note]] by [[Spencer Silver]] in 1968.

In June 2004, a British translation company voted the word to be one of the ten English [[words hardest to translate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Words hardest to translate – The list by Today Translations. Also defined in modern times as "An unexpected discovery occurring by design". Unknown reference updated on 12/14/2014 by Isaac Lucero, Santa Fe, NM USA |publisher=Global Oneness |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125055716/http://experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its sociological use, the word has since been exported into many other languages.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [[portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''serendipicidade'' or ''serendipidade''; French ''sérendipicité'' or ''sérendipité'' but also ''heureux hasard'', "fortunate chance"; Italian ''serendipità'' ([http://dizionari.hoepli.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/serendipita.aspx?idD=1&amp;Query=serendipit%C3%A0&amp;lettera=S Italian Dictionary Hoepli, cfr.]); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''serendipiteit''; German ''Serendipität''; Japanese serendipiti (セレンディピティ); [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''serendipitet''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''serendipitate''; Spanish ''serendipia'', Polish: ''Serendypność''; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''serendipiteetti''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first noted use of "serendipity" in the [[English language]] was by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet|Horace Mann]], Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a (lost) painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-04|title=Lost artworks|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost_artworks&amp;oldid=798895435|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bianca Cappello]] by [[Giorgio Vasari]] by reference to a  Persian fairy tale, ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''. The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Theodore G. |editor-last=Remer |title=Serendipity and the Three Princes, from the Peregrinaggio of 1557 |page=6|others=Edited, with an Introduction and Notes, by Theodore G. Remer. Preface by W. S. Lewis |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1965 }} LCC 65-10112&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from ''[[Names of Sri Lanka#Ceylon, Serendip and related names|Serendip]]'', an old name for [[Sri Lanka]] (Ceylon), hence ''Sarandib'' by Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Robert K. Merton, Elinor|title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity : A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691126305|pages=1–3|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Sanskrit ''Siṃhaladvīpaḥ'' (Siṃhalaḥ, Sri Lanka + dvīpaḥ, island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/serendipity|title=serendipity|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and strategy==
M. E. Graebner describes serendipitous value in the context of the acquisition of a business as "windfalls that were not anticipated by the buyer prior to the deal": i.e., unexpected advantages or benefits incurred due to positive synergy effects of the merger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Ikujiro Nonaka]]&lt;ref&gt;1991, p.&amp;nbsp;94 November–December issue of [[Harvard Business Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the serendipitous quality of innovation is highly recognized by managers and links the success of Japanese enterprises to their ability to create knowledge not by processing information but rather by "tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches of individual employees and making those insights available for testing and use by the company as a whole".

Serendipity is postulated by Napier and Vuong (2013) as a 'strategic advantage' with which a firm can tap its potential creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdjYAQAAQBAJ Napier, Nancy K., and Vuong Quan Hoang. "Serendipity as a strategic advantage?." ''Strategic Management in the 21st Century; edited by Timothy J. Wilkinson.'', '''2013''', ''1'', 175–199.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serendipity is a key concept in [[competitive intelligence]] because it is one of the tools for avoiding blind spots (see [[Blindspots analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html Serendipity in Competitive Intelligence by [[Yves-Michel Marti]], Egideria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827142133/http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

==Uses==
Serendipity is used as a [[sociology|sociological]] method in [[Anselm L. Strauss]]' and [[Barney G. Glaser]]'s ''[[grounded theory]]'', building on ideas by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]], who in ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949) referred to the "serendipity pattern" as the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory. Merton also co-authored (with Elinor Barber) ''The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity'',&lt;ref&gt;Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the origins and uses of the word "serendipity" since it was coined. The book is "a study in sociological semantics and the sociology of science", as the subtitle of the book declares. It further develops the idea of serendipity as scientific "method" (as juxtaposed with purposeful discovery by experiment or retrospective prophecy).

=={{anchor|Zemblanity|Bahramdipity}}Related terms==
[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] coined the term '''zemblanity''' in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: "making unhappy, unlucky and unexpected discoveries occurring by design".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, William. ''Armadillo'', Chapter 12, [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-375-40223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A zemblanity is, effectively, an "unpleasant unsurprise". It derives from [[Novaya Zemlya]] (or Nova Zembla), a cold, barren land with many features opposite to the lush Sri Lanka (Serendip). On this island [[Willem Barents]] and his crew were stranded while searching for a new route to the east.

'''Bahramdipity''' is derived directly from [[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] as characterized in ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''.  It describes the ''suppression'' of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.&lt;ref&gt;(a) [http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1999/feb/opin_990201.html Sommer, Toby J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">'''Spatial [[epidemiology]]''' is a [[Discipline (academia)|subfield]] of [[health geography]] focused on the study of the [[Space|spatial]] distribution of health outcomes.

Specifically, spatial epidemiology is concerned with the description and examination of disease and its geographic variations. This is done in consideration of “demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk factors."&lt;ref name=pmid15198920&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Paul |last2=Wartenberg |first2=Daniel |title=Spatial epidemiology: current approaches and future challenges |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=112 |issue=9 |pages=998–1006 |year=2004 |pmid=15198920 |pmc=1247193 |jstor=3838101 |doi=10.1289/ehp.6735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of studies==
;Disease Mapping:
* Disease maps are visual representations of intricate geographic data that provide a quick overview of said information. Mainly used for explanatory purposes, disease maps can be presented to survey high-risk areas and to help policy and resource allocation in said areas.

;Geographic correlation studies
* Geographic correlation studies attempt to study the geographical factors and their effects on geographically differentiated health outcomes. Measured on an ecologic scale, these factors include environmental variables (quality of surrounding space), socioeconomic and demographic statistics (income and race), or even lifestyle choices (nutrition or diet) of the population groups under study. This approach has the convenience of being able to employ already available data from various surveying sources.

;Clustering, disease clusters, and surveillance.
* Disease clusters, or spatial groupings of proximity and characteristically related epidemics. While the term itself is relatively poorly defined, it generally “implies an excess of cases above some background rate bounded in time and space.”&lt;ref name=pmid15198920/&gt; Although clustering is not the most precise method for spatial analysis, it can and has proved useful for health-related surveillance and monitoring.

Because the statistical models used to draw up such research are complex, the data analysis and the interpretation of results should be carried out by qualified statisticians. Sometimes, the proliferation of errors in disease mapping has led to inefficient decision-making, implementation of inappropriate health policies and negative impact on the advancement of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ocaña-Riola R |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20503184 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
;Data availability and quality
* Since spatial epidemiology is almost entirely based on the analysis of data and its various visual representations, data collection methods must be routine, accurate, and publicly available. With the advent of specialized and accurate health equipment and global information networks, these methods can be relatively and easily improved. Compiling and standardizing data can also be done efficiently and usefully given the right tools and processes.

;Data protection and confidentiality
* In our current time, legislation in the United States regarding individual human rights are gaining increasing support, especially in regards to the confidentiality of personal health data and consent over its use in medical investigations. Safe and secure data is a crucial aspect of successful epidemiologic research.

;Exposure assessment and mapping
* Typically always seen as an analytical weakness, the quality of exposure data, or reported accuracy of the spatial reach of epidemics, is especially important in spatial epidemiology. With the more mainstream use of geographic information systems, the capabilities of spatial interpolation and mapping have been tremendously improved, yet these still greatly depend on the precision and legitimacy of the source data commissioned.

'''''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature''''' is a book by [[Harvard University]] psychologist and philosopher [[William James]]. It comprises his edited [[Gifford Lectures]] on [[natural theology]], which were delivered at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland in 1901 and 1902. The lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science in the academic study of religion.

Soon after its publication, ''Varieties'' entered the [[Western canon]] of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.

James later developed his philosophy of [[pragmatism]]. There are many overlapping ideas in ''Varieties'' and his 1907 book, ''Pragmatism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=Randall A | chapter = William James in the Moscow Psychological Society | title = William James in Russian Culture | editor1-first = Joan DeLaney | editor1-last = Grossman | editor2-first = Ruth | editor2-last = Rischin|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books | location =Lanham MD|isbn=978-0739105269|page =143|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rwdz4eU8VKkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious experiences==
James was most interested in direct religious experiences. Theology and the organizational aspects of religion were of secondary interest. He believed that religious experiences were simply human experiences: "Religious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is trance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPVvBgAAQBAJ|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience (Annotated)|last=James|first=William|date=1913-01-01|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He believed that religious experiences can have "morbid origins"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNTcr6E83YIC|title=Psychology and Religion: Eight Points of View|last=Fuller|first=Andrew Reid|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780822630364|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in brain pathology and can be irrational but nevertheless are largely positive. Unlike the bad ideas that people have under the influence of a high fever, after a religious experience the ideas and insights usually remain and are often valued for the rest of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LhkseyUMgAC&amp;pg=PR34&amp;lpg=PR34&amp;dq=%25E2%2580%259Chigh+fever%25E2%2580%259D+william+james+varieties+of+religious&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hu4vUW-jw4&amp;sig=Ase-dVOwJOYK5xDTO4qTJ7la7gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l0QPVfj8ComYNpewg2g&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=feverish%2520fancies&amp;f=false|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience|last=James|first=William|date=1985-01-01|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674932258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under James’ [[pragmatism]], the effectiveness of religious experiences proves their truth, whether they stem from religious practices or from drugs: "[[Nitrous oxide]] ... stimulate[s] the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AInm-3hXfo0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Nitrous+oxide+and+ether,+especially+nitrous+oxide,+when+sufficiently+diluted+with+air,+stimulate+the+mystical+consciousness+in+an+extraordinary+degree.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wYPg09a2Rj&amp;sig=8u9wBRE49J4_nhqlziMv47kpOwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HEYPVZLLJ4PugwSLnYHACw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nitrous%2520oxide%2520and%2520ether%252C%2520especially%2520nitrous%2520oxide%252C%2520when%2520sufficiently%2520diluted%2520with%2520air%252C%2520stimulate%2520the%2520mystical%2520consciousness%2520in%2520an%2520extraordinary%2520degree.&amp;f=false|title=The Highlights of William James towards Spiritual Recovery from Addictions Taken from the "Varieties of Religious Experience": A most ideal reading for those experiencing difficulty with the Spiritual Aspect of the 12 step program to the Recovery of Happiness|last=G|first=Jim|date=2011-04-29|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781456768799|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James had relatively little interest in the legitimacy or illegitimacy of religious experiences. Further, despite James' examples being almost exclusively drawn from [[Christianity]], he did not mean to limit his ideas to any single religion. Religious experiences are something that people sometimes have under certain conditions. In James' description, these conditions are likely to be psychological or pharmaceutical rather than cultural.

==Existential judgment vs. proposition of value==

James believed that the origins of a religion shed little light upon its value. There is a distinction between an existential judgment (a judgment on "constitution, origin, and history") and a proposition of value (a judgment on "importance, meaning, or significance").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |edition= |editor= |date=1987 |title=The Varieties of Religious Experience |page=13 |location= |publisher=[[The Library of America]] |isbn=978-0-940450-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the founder of the [[Quakers|Quaker religion]], [[George Fox]], had been a hereditary degenerate, the Quaker religion could yet be "a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever known in England."

Furthermore, the potentially dubious psychological origins of religious beliefs apply just as well to non-religious beliefs:
{{Quotation |Scientific theories are organically conditioned just as much as religious emotions are; and if we only knew the facts intimately enough, we should doubtless see "the [[liver]]" determining the dicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the Methodist under conviction anxious about his soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |edition= |editor= |date=1987 |title=The Varieties of Religious Experience |page=21 |location= |publisher=[[The Library of America]] |isbn=978-0-940450-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reality of the unseen==

James criticized scientists for ignoring unseen aspects of the universe. Science studies some of reality, but not all of it:

{{Quotation |Vague impressions of something indefinable have no place in the rationalistic system.... Nevertheless, if we look on man's whole mental life as it exists ..., we have to confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an account of is relatively superficial. It is the part that has the prestige undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words.... Your whole subconscious life, your impulses, your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared the premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something in you absolutely knows that that result must be truer than any logic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may contradict it.&lt;ref name="Mounce2002"&gt;{{citation|author=Howard Mounce|title=The Two Pragmatisms: From Peirce to Rorty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeCEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|date=22 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-74343-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=="Healthy mindedness" vs. "the sick soul"==
James saw "healthy mindedness" as America’s main contribution to religion. This is the religious experience of [[optimism]] and positive thinking which James sees running from the [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] to [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s [[Christian Science]]. At the extreme, the "healthy minded" see sickness and evil as an illusion. James considered belief in the "mind cure" to be reasonable when compared to [[medicine]] as practiced at the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duclow|first=Donald F.|date=2002-01-01|title=William James, Mind-Cure, and the Religion of Healthy-Mindedness|jstor=27511579|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=41|issue=1|pages=45–56|doi=10.2307/27511579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "sick souls" ("morbid-mindedness" / the "twice born") are merely those who hit bottom before their religious experience; those whose redemption gives relief from the pains they suffered beforehand. By contrast, the "healthy minded" deny the need for such preparatory pain or suffering. James believes that "morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience" and that while healthy-mindedness is a surprisingly effective "religious solution",

{{Quote |"healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key to life’s significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth."}}

James sees the two types as being a mere matter of temperament: the healthy minded having a "constitutional incapacity for prolonged suffering"; the morbid minded being those prone to "religious melancholia".

==Saintliness==
For James, a [[saint]]ly character is one where "spiritual emotions are the habitual centre of the personal energy." &lt;br&gt;
James states that saintliness includes:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|"1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world's selfish little interests; and a conviction … of the existence of an Ideal Power.&lt;br&gt;
2. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own life, and a willing self-surrender to its control.&lt;br&gt;
3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining selfhood melt down.&lt;br&gt;
4. A shifting of the emotional Centre towards loving and harmonious affections, towards "yes, yes" and away from "no," where the claims of the non-ego are concerned."}}

For James the practical consequences of saintliness are [[asceticism]] (pleasure in sacrifice), strength of soul (a "blissful equanimity" free from anxieties), purity (a withdrawal from the material world), and charity (tenderness to those most would naturally disdain).

==Mysticism==
James identified two main features to a [[mystical experience]]:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|[[Ineffability]] —" no adequate report of its contents can be given in words. […] its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. […]  mystical states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect. No one can make clear to another who has never had a certain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists."

[[Noesis|Noetic]] quality —"Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They are illuminations, revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a rule they carry with them a curious sense of authority for after-time."}}

He also identified two subsidiary features that are often, but not always, found with mystical experiences:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|Transiency —"Mystical states cannot be sustained for long."

Passivity —"the mystic feels as if his own will were in abeyance, and indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a superior power."}}

==Reception==
The August 1902 ''New York Times'' review of the first edition ends with the following:

{{Quotation|Everywhere there is a frolic welcome to the eccentricities and extravagances of the religious life.  Many will question whether its more sober exhibitions would not have been more fruitful of results, but the interest and fascination of the treatment are beyond dispute, and so, too, is the sympathy to which nothing human is indifferent.&lt;ref name= "nyt1902"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CE5DA113DEE32A2575AC0A96E9C946397D6CF | title = A Study of Man: ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''|work= The New York Times | date= August 9, 1902 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A July 1963 ''Time'' magazine review of an expanded edition published that year ends with quotes about the book from Peirce and Santayana:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,896918,00.html | title = Books: The Waterspouts of God | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=July 19, 1963| accessdate = 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|In making little allowance for the fact that people can also be converted to vicious creeds, he acquired admirers he would have deplored. [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], for instance, hailed James as a preceptor who had showed him that "an action should be judged by its result rather than by its doctrinary basis." James ... had no intention of giving comfort to latter-day totalitarians. He was simply impatient with his fellow academicians and their endless hairsplitting over matters that had no relation to life. A vibrant, generous person, he hoped to show that religious emotions, even those of the deranged, were crucial to human life. The great virtue of ''The Varieties'', noted pragmatist philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], is its "penetration into the hearts of people." Its great weakness, retorted [[George Santayana]], is its "tendency to disintegrate the idea of truth, to recommend belief without reason and to encourage superstition."}}

* 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface was invented with the [[chiaroscuro]] painting technique that employs highlights and shadows.
* 250 BCE – [[Glassblowing]] was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia.
* 105 – [[Paper]] was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official.
* 650 – [[Porcelain]] was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar).
* 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by [[Giotto di Bondone]] using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time.
* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".
* 1485 – [[Sfumato]], a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.  Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's "Virgin on the Rocks" and "[[Mona Lisa]]".
* 1503 – [[Surrealism]] was invented by Flemish artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] with his triptych "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]".
* 1774 – [[Jasperware]], a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by [[Josiah Wedgwood]].

* 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing "Mrs. Charles Badham".
* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].

He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.
* 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with their one-minute film "L’Arrivée du Train".
* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.
* 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Patenting Art and Entertainment'' by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – the [[Readymade]] was invented and exhibited by [[Marcel Duchamp]], "The Fountain" an upturned urinal signed by the artist.

Refer to US Patent 2,201,689.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1947–50 – Painting was reinvented by [[Jackson Pollock]] whose novel method of spontaneously dripping and splattering paint from a can onto unscratched canvas laid out on the floor brought about an expanded understanding of pure abstraction and of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Jackson_Pollock.html |title=and also Michael Kimmelman www.NY Times.com "A Drip by Any Other Name", February 12, 2006 |publisher=Manythings.org |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948 – The [[Glass House]] by the architect [[Philip Johnson]] reduced building down to its most basic elements: a horizontal slab on the ground, vertical supports, a flat roof and transparent glass wrapped around it.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1952 – Stain painting, in which liquid paint soaks and bleeds into the fabric of unprimed canvas, was invented by [[Joan Miró]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] who influenced [[Helen Frankenthaler]], as seen in her painting "Mountains and Sea" of 1952.
* 1959 – the first public "[[happening]]" was produced by Allan Kaprow at the Reuben Gallery in New York.  A happening is defined by Kaprow as a choreographed event that facilitates interactions between objects including performers and visitors.  Happenings were influenced by Jackson Pollock's process of action painting, Dada and the teachings of John Cage on chance and indeterminacy.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

'''Toxic units (TU)''' are used in the field of toxicology to quantify the interactions of [[toxicant]]s in binary mixtures of chemicals. A toxic unit for a given compound is based on the concentration at which there is a 50% effect (ex. [[EC50]]) for a certain biological endpoint. One toxic unit is equal to the EC50 for a given endpoint for a specific biological effect over a given amount of time. Toxic units allow for the comparison of the individual toxicities of a binary mixture to the combined toxicity. This allows researchers to categorize mixtures as additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Synergism and antagonism are defined by mixtures that are more or less toxic than predicted by the sum of their toxic units.

[[Contamination|Contaminants]] are frequently present as mixtures in the environment. Regulatory decisions are based on mixture toxicity models that assume additivity, which can result in under or overestimation of toxic effects. Refining our understanding of mixture interactions can lead to better informed environmental management and decision making. In addition, exploring mixture interactions can elucidate the mechanisms of action for specific toxicants which, in many cases, are poorly understood.

== Methods ==
Application of toxic units requires toxicity data for the individual components of the mixture as well as specialized mixture toxicity data. Evaluating the response of each individual chemical allows researchers to generate a new dosing metric, toxic units, which is standardized to the toxicity of each chemical. Since the toxicity of two compounds may vary widely, 1 toxic unit of two different compounds could correspond to two very different concentrations on a per mass basis. In addition to the toxicity of the individual components, use of toxic units requires a 2x2 factorial design concentration series where the response is measured to an increase of each contaminant with the other contaminant held constant. This elaborate concentration series allows researchers to describe how the mixture components interact with each other and predict effects at untested combinations components with nonlinear regression models.

=== Point estimates ===
[[File:Concentration-response curve.jpg|thumb|Example of concentration-response model used to calculate EC50. Toxciant concentration is on the X-axis and biological response is on the Y-axis.]]
[[Point estimation]] is a technique to predict population parameters based on available sample data and can be used to relate the mass based concentration to a toxicity based metric. Point estimates in toxicology are frequently response endpoints on a [[Dose–response relationship|dose response curve]]. These point estimates predict at what concentration one would expect to see a given biological endpoint like 50% mortality ([[LC50]]). Any toxicological endpoint (growth inhibition, reproduction, behavior etc.) can be used as the toxicity metric to convert from mass based concentration to toxic units.

Point estimates are generated by fitting a [[nonlinear regression]] model to toxicity data and using that model to predict the concentration of chemical required to elicit a known response of the biological endpoint.

=== Equation and calculations ===
One Toxic unit can be defined by the researcher as the concentration of a given chemical required to cause a given toxicological endpoint ([[LC50]], [[EC50]], [[IC50]]).

ex. 1TU=LC50 or 1TU=IC50 for inhibition of growth

Since the mass or molar based concentrations of different chemicals required to cause a given endpoint like an LC50 may vary widely, the concentration that corresponds to 1TU is specific to each individual chemical tested.

=== Isobolograms ===

Isobolograms are one way to present the results of binary mixture toxicity testing based in toxic units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warne MSJ. 2003. A Review of the Ecotoxicity of Mixtures, Approaches to and Recommendations for, their Management. Proceedings of the Fifth National Workshop on the Assessment of Site Contamination. EPHC. pp.256&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this method is it's simplicity and ease of use. First a line of additivity is plotted that corresponds to all the combinations of the two chemicals that would result in one toxic unit. Next the experimental results from binary mixture tests are plotted on the isobologram. The results from the mixture test are point estimates from the mixture dose response curves that correspond to the single chemical tests. When these mixture point estimates are plotted on the isobologram, the region that they fall into (based on the concentrations of the two chemicals required to cause that given endpoint) demonstrates whether the mixture interactions are [[Interaction#Biochemistry|additive]], [[Synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic]] or [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]].

===Response surfaces===
[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|Three dimensional graph depicting the function F(x,y) where x and y could be the concentration of the individual components in toxic units and the height of the graph depicts the toxicological response.]]Response surfaces are a more advanced and complex way to visualize the same information presented in an isobologram. A response surface is a three dimensional graph with concentrations of individual components in toxic units on the x and y axis and the response variable on the z axis. This three dimensional representation of the organisms response to the two chemical stressors can be used to predict the toxicity of any combination of the components based on the nonlinear regression models that form the response surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects ===
The primary utility of toxic units is to classify mixture interactions as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Additivity means that the toxicity of the mixture is equal to the sum of the toxicities of the individual components. Additivity is the default assumption of models used to predict toxicity of mixtures for regulatory and environmental management purposes. Synergistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of the mixture is greater than the sum of the individual toxicities. Conversely, antagonistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of a mixture is less than would be predicted by additivity. Understanding mixture interactions can prevent over or underestimation of toxicity by regulators who assume additivity for uncategorized mixtures.

== Applications ==

=== Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] uses toxic units as a benchmark, called the [[Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks|equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark (ESB)]], for predicting the toxicity of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH)-contaminated sediments to benthic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Procedures for the derivation of ESBs for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures. EPA/600/R-02/013. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic units are calculated from sediment concentrations of 34 PAHs and their expected sediment, water, and lipid partitioning behavior. Based on the equilibrium partitioning approach (which accounts for the varying biological availability of chemicals in different sediments), the ESB for total PAH is the sum of the quotients of a minimum of each of the 34 individual PAHs in a specific sediment, divided by the final chronic value concentration for each specific PAH in sediment. According to the U.S. EPA, freshwater or saltwater sediments that contain less or equal to 1.0 toxic units of the mixture of the 34 PAHs or more PAHs are acceptable for the protection of benthic organisms. Sediments that are greater than 1.0 toxic units are not protective and potentially have adverse effects to benthic organisms.

U.S. EPA ESBs do not consider antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects of other sediment contaminants and have been criticized as an overly conservative estimate for pyrogenic PAHs (such as those from manufactured gas plant processes).&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne SB, DJ Miller, and JP Kreitinger. 2006. Measurement of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments and toxic units used for estimating risk to benthic invertebrates at manufactured gas plant sites. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 25(1):287-296&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the analytical approaches for determining the toxic units for both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs.

=== Toxicity identification evaluation ===
The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) is an approach to systematically characterize, identify, and confirm toxic substances in whole sediments and sediment interstitial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess RM and KT Ho. Sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation. Chapter S, Ferard and Blaise (ed.), Encyclopedia of Aquatic Ecotoxicology. Springer, New York, NY, 8/13/2013:online, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is typically carried out by the U.S. EPA. The effluent effect concentration data and the measured toxicant concentration data are transformed to toxic units for the regression analysis to evaluate whether a linear relationship exists between two or more toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 1993. Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity. EPA/600/R-92/081. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The limitations associated with using Toxic Units are largely dependent on the methodology in which they are being used. For example, the use of isobolograms is applicable to only binary mixtures. In general, Toxic Units are based on point estimates which are limited by projection. Point estimates, and therefore Toxic Units, are a simplification of a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]]. Information about toxic effects at concentrations other than the point estimate are lost in translation.

=== Alternative ways to study mixtures ===

==== Top-down Approach ====
A common method for studying mixtures is to measure the total toxicity of the mixture and consider the internal toxicant interactions as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any mixture effects are taken into account in the total toxicity. The results for this method are limited by being mixture specific and has limited value in determining specific mechanisms of toxicity.

==== GLM Approach ====
Using [[Generalized linear model|Generalized Linear Models (GLM)]] allows for complex, non-parametric model fitting to describe the toxicity complex mixtures. Generalized Linear Models are more likely to find significant differences from additivity than TU approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37981637|title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology|last=C.|first=Newman, Michael|date=1998|publisher=Ann Arbor Press|isbn=1575040131|oclc=37981637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLM approach also allows for the alteration of models to reflect current knowledge of biological mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Mixtures: Methods for In Vivo Toxicity Testing|last=National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods for the In Vivo Toxicity Testing of Complex Mixtures|first=|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|year=1998|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24920">[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] is the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The disclosure of media ownership can be prescribed by generic regulation (commercial law) or by media-specific provision. Such measures may mandate the disclosure of information on media ownership structures to specific authorities or to the general public.

Turkey has both generic company laws and media-specific regulations on transparency of the print, broadcasting and online media outlets. Despite the existence of such laws, according to some experts the existing regulatory framework does not guarantee the disclosure of crucial information and to know who actually owns and influences the media in Turkey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/162199587/TMO-Turkey|title=Transparency of Media Ownership- The Legal Framework. Turkey|last=|first=|date=2013|website=scribd.com|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
With regard to the disclosure of media ownership information, Turkey has both generic company laws and specific regulations concerning the printed, broadcast and online sectors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf|title=The Transparency of Media Ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States: Report on a Project by Access Info Europe and the Open Society Program on Independent Journalism|last=Craufurd-Smith|first=R.|last2=Stolte|first2=Y.|date=2014|website=research.ed.ac.uk|publisher=Open Society Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations provide both for the disclosure to public bodies such as the Chief Prosecutor's Office and the [[Radio and Television Supreme Council|“Radio and Television Supreme Council” (RTUK)]], and for the disclosure to citizens through the publication of ownership information on the media companies’ websites.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

However, a research by [[Access Info Europe]] shows that the existing laws misses to prescribe the disclosure of crucial information therefore failing to actually disclose who owns and influences the media in Turkey. In fact, neither print media (under the Press Law) nor broadcast (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts) or online media (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts and the Law on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online) are required to report the essential information needed to identify ownership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, as ''Access Info'' notes, the law applying to broadcasting and on demand services does not require to disclose if shares are held on behalf of another nor the existence of [[beneficial owner]]s.

Uncertainty in the realm of transparency of media ownership in Turkey increased after 2001, when the ban on media conglomerates' bidding in public tenders was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5210149/The_media_ownership_in_Turkey_and_its_advantages|title=The media ownership in Turkey and its advantages|last=Sözeri|first=Ceren|date=2013|website=academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 15 years, the biggest Turkish media owners are corporations also operating in sectors such as construction, energy, mining and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/owners/|title=Media Owners|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mulksuzlestirme.org/index.en/|title=Networks of Dispossession|last=|first=|date=|website=mulksuzlestirme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, strong ties with the government are lamented by Turkish civil society and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/media-integrity-report-media-ownership-and-financing-turkey|title=Media integrity report: Media ownership and financing in Turkey|last=Tunç|first=Asli|date=November 30, 2015|website=mediaobservatory.net|publisher=South East European Media Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Books/Media-in-New-Turkey.-The-Origins-of-an-Authoritarian-Neoliberal-State|title=Media in New Turkey.

The situation of uncertain transparency of media ownership increased throughout 2015 and 2016, when government's trustees were appointed to allegedly [[Gülen movement|Gulenist]]-affiliated media outlets and companies. A takeover took place in October 26, 2016 for the [[Koza İpek Holding|Koza-Ipek Media Group]], which owned, among others, ''Bugun'' and ''Millet'' dailies and [[Cihan News Agency]]. Similarly, trustees were appointed on March 5, 2016, for [[Feza Publications|Feza Holding]], the media holding publishing, among others, the most read newspaper in Turkey, [[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]], and the English-language daily [[Today's Zaman|Today's Zaman]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=2961658&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=2397056&amp;Usage=2|title=Memorandum on freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey|last=Muižnieks|first=Nils|date=February 15, 2017|website=wcd.coe.int|publisher=Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/human-rights/172807-trustee-appointed-to-cihan-news-agency|title=Trustee Appointed to Cihan News Agency|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2016|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/law/168682-trustee-appointed-to-koza-holding|title=Trustee Appointed to Koza Holding|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2015|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/media/168745-map-of-media-ownership-in-turkey|title=Map of Media Ownership in Turkey|last=Akgül|first=Elif|date=October 29, 2015|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of these companies are currently under the jurisdiction of the government's [[Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey|Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF)]], and it is not clear if the companies will be either dissolved or sold off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/11/turkey-what-government-do-with-gulen-linked-companies.html#ixzz4c48qYBbK|title=What's next for hundreds of companies seized by Turkish government?|last=Cetingulec|first=Mehmet|date=November 2016|work=Al Monitor|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-government-became-top-tycoon.html|title=How Turkey’s government became the country’s top tycoon|last=Doğan|first=Zülfikar|date=October 2016|work=Al Monitor|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/turkey-hires-advisers-to-sell-10-billion-of-seized-companies|title=Turkey Hires Advisers to Sell $10 Billion of Seized Firms|last=Ersoy|first=Ercan|date=November 30, 2016|work=Bloomberg News|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
Disclosure of ownership information of [[Broadcasting|broadcast media]] (radio and television) is required by Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawsturkey.com/law/law-on-the-establishment-of-radio-and-television-enterprises-and-their-media-services-6112|title=Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts|last=|first=|date=February 15, 2011|website=lawsturkey.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Regulation on the Administrative and Financial Terms to Be Obeyed By Media Service Provider Institutions and the Platform and Infrastructure Service Operators (2011). With regard to print media, disclosure is required by the Press Law No. 5187 (2004). Finally, with regard to online media, disclosure is required by Law No. 5651 on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11035|title=Law No. 5651 on Regulating Broadcasting in the Internet and Fighting Against Crimes Committed through Internet Broadcasting|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2007|website=wipo.int|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2016)011-e|title=Opinion on Law No. 5651 on Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Combating Crimes Committed by Means of such Publication ("The Internet Law")|last=|first=|date=June 10–11, 2016|website=venice.coe.int|publisher=Venice Commission, European Commission for Democracy through Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles of Internet Broadcasts (2007).

Law No. 6112 on broadcasters requires “media service providers” to report ownership information. They are defined as legal entities which choose the content of the radio, television and on-demand broadcasting services. Instead, according to the Press Law, ownership information have to be disclosed for media organizations publishing “printed materials”. Finally, the legislation on [[Internet regulation in Turkey#Organization of the ICTA|online media]] includes within its scope content providers, [[Internet hosting service|hosting service providers]] and [[Internet service provider#Access providers ISP|access providers]] (under Article No. 3 of Law No. 5651). They should publish their up to date information in the homepage of their website.

According to the relevant regulations for radios and televisions, ownership information have to be notified when a licence application is made, in cases of transfer of shares, acquisition and merger, changes to the disclosed information and annually, following the annual general meeting of [[shareholder]]s. Instead, under the Press Law, information have to be disclosed before publishing a newspaper or other periodicals.

Except for online media, if the information has the nature of [[Trade secret|commercial secret]], it can be withheld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, this was the case when the ''[[Media Ownership Monitor]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/|title=Media Ownership Monitor Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a project conducted by a team of members of ''[[Bianet]]'', an independent Turkish press agency, and [[Reporters Without Borders]] – requested information regarding the Turkish public broadcaster's ([[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]]) finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seenpm.org/owns-media-turkey-media-ownership-monitoring-project/|title=‘Who Owns the Media in Turkey?’ – Media Ownership Monitoring Project|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2016|website=seenpm.org|publisher=South East European Network for Professionalization of Media|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctions for non-disclosure are foreseen in the Press Law and in the Internet Law, covering only printed and online publications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also foreign media organizations are covered by the above listed requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Information to be disclosed ===
According to the laws, the information that have to be disclosed by the information providers are:
* Name and contact details of media organisation;
* Name and contact details of owner;
* Country of domicile of company with an interest;
* Citizenship/residence status of individual with an interest;
* Except for the online media, the size of shareholding, namely the current shareholding structure, the voting shares, the capital-shares, the managers
* Management details: names of the members of board of directors, names and citizenship details of general managers and managers in charge and the duties of managers);
* Only for broadcasting media, if spouses, blood relatives and relatives in law up to the third degree are shareholders in the company, it will be indicated within the shareholdership structure considering these shares as owned by the same person;
* Only for print media, disclosure is required also for political, religious or other affiliations of shareholder, interests by owners in other media organisations and in non-media businesses.
Experts consider that existing obligations are not sufficient to establish who the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media organisations are.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Disclosure to public authorities ===
According to the Press Law, disclosure of ownership information has to be made to the Office of the local Chief Prosecutor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Law No. 6112 on media service providers (broadcaster), their ownership information have to be reported to the [[Radio and Television Supreme Council|“Radio and Television Supreme Council” (RTÜK)]] .

However, experts consider that regulators have no transparent, credible, and accessible annual records on media ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/monitoring-eu-guidelines-turkey-instruments-political-propaganda-and-censorship|title=Monitoring EU Guidelines in Turkey: Instruments of political propaganda and censorship|last=Tunç|first=Asli|date=June 21, 2015|website=mediaobservatory.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/p24-publishes-report-turkey%E2%80%99s-media-watchdog-lawmakers|title=P24 publishes a report on Turkey’s media watchdog - for lawmakers|last=|first=|date=May 12, 2016|website=mediaobservatory.net|publisher=P24 Platform for Independent Journalism|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclosure to the citizens ===
The information notified to the RTÜK have also to be published by the media organizations concerned on their websites. Under the Press Law, the records of the Public Prosecutor's office shall be public and anyone can see the relevant files containing published information and documents by making an application.

Information on media ownership can be obtained by the public by making a Freedom of Information request, under Law No. 4982, on the [[Access to public information in Turkey|Right to Obtain Information]] which entitles individuals to request information and documents from public and publicly owned bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/Yayinlar/LEGISLATION_ON_THE_RIGHT_TO_INFORMATION/LEGISLATION_ON_THE_RIGHT_TO_INFORMATION.pdf|title=Legislation on the Right to Information|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2014|website=bedk.gov.tr|publisher=REPUBLIC OF TURKEY, PRIME MINISTRY, The Review Board of Access to Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, requests for information related to media ownership are raised by professionals and media institutions, while it is not common among ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media service providers (radio and TV broadcasters) can only be set up as [[Joint-stock company|joint stock companies]]. Only [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] have to disclose information to the trade registry, under the Turkish Commercial Code No. 6102.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11081|title=Turkish Commercial Code (Law No. 6102)|last=|first=|date=January 13, 2011|website=wipo.int|publisher=|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media companies entering in the category of public joint-stock companies also have to respect the Capital Market Law No. 2499 (1981) and the Communiqué on Financial Reporting of the Capital Markets Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Communique_on_Financial_Reporting_of_Capital_Markets_Board_English.pdf|title=Communiqué on the Principles of Financial Reporting in Capital Markets, No.  26842|last=|first=|date=April 9, 2008|website=.access-info.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borsaistanbul.com/data/kilavuzlar/Public%20Disclosure%20Platform.pdf?hocvqgtkepcoaakb|title=Public Disclosure Forum|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=borsaistanbul.com|publisher=Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These public enterprises should regularly draw financial statements to the [[Capital Markets Board of Turkey|Capital Markets Board]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmb.gov.tr/|title=Capital Markets Board of Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=cmb.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annual reports should be disclosed to the public.

An example of public joint-stock company in the field of media is the state-run [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT- Türkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu).

The results of a survey  clearly showed that the sole enforcement of commercial law provides insufficient information regarding who effectively owns and ultimately controls media organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Beneficial ownership ==
None of the laws regulating print, broadcast and online media requires disclosure of [[beneficial owner]]s, i.e. holders owning shares on behalf of another person, or those with indirect control or a significant interest to a media authority or to the public.

If the media company is established as a joint stock company, shareholding information can easily be accessed through the company's website and through the database of the trade registry. However, if shares are owned by one and actually used by another one as per an internal agreement, this information is not required to be disclosed by private or publicly-listed companies meaning ultimate ownership cannot therefore be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12181|title=Turkey TMO Consultation|last=|first=|date=|website=access-info.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, experts consider that a reasonable, non-technical individual would not be able to ascertain who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media organisation, from the information available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influence of advertising financing ==
As advertising is an important income for media providers and  the allocation of advertisements may influence editorial policies or weaken certain media rather than others, media service providers (broadcasters) shall report their monthly commercial advertisement income to the RTÜK, by the 20th day of the following month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The distribution of public funds on advertising is existentially an important source of income for smaller papers but the relative data remain hidden. For instance, the request of information on this topic by the [[Media Ownership Monitor]] was refused by the [[Access to public information in Turkey|Turkish Right to Information Assessment Council]], citing “trade secrets” as a reason.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/findings/indicators/#!8dc92ea5c8f7b762a99f91c4dd1096e8|title=(Political) Control over Media Funding|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|publication-place=Media Ownership Monitor- Turkey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the coup attempt, on October 5, 2016, regulations regarding  the [[Press Advertising Institution]] (''[[:tr:Basın İlan Kurumu|Basın İlan Kurumu]]''- BİK)- the authority managing public announcements and advertising- were changed. According to this contested regulation,&lt;ref&gt;Regulation No. 29848, October 5, 2010, Art. No. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  any news outlet that employs a journalist who is being tried on terrorism related charges will not be given state advertising, unless the employee is fired from the media organization in five days.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Civil society initiatives ==
Referring to the actions to be taken at a domestic level, some experts underlined the importance of encouraging public debate on media ownership, and to enhance media literacy on this topic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Reporters Without Borders]], together with the Turkish independent press agency [[Bianet]], launched the project ''[[Media Ownership Monitor]] Turkey'' to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Turkey, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets (both individual owners and media companies) and detailing also the interests and the affiliations of owners into companies or political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/|title=Media Ownership Monitor Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another civil society initiative is the ''[[Network Data Compiling]]'', a collective data compiling and mapping project dedicated to pursue the relations between capital and power in Turkey, released on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Writeprint''' is a method in [[forensic linguistics]] of establishing author identification over the internet, likened to a digital fingerprint.  Identity is established through a comparison of distinguishing [[stylometry|stylometric]] characteristics of an unknown written text with known samples of the suspected author ([[writer invariant]]s).  Even without a suspect, writeprint provides potential background characteristics of the author, such as nationality and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jiexun|last2=Zheng|first2=Rong|last3=Chen|first3=Hsinchun|title=From Fingerprint to Writeprint|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2006|volume=49|issue=4|pages=76–82|doi=10.1145/1121949.1121951|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1121951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five broad aspects to author identification in writeprint:  
:*lexical features- The analysis of the [[lexicon]], the author's choice of vocabulary.  
:*syntactic features- The analysis of the author's writing style and sentence structure, such as: punctuation, use of passive voice, and sentence complexity.
:*structural features- The analysis of the author's organization of the work.  These include paragraph length, spacing, and indentation.  
:*content-specific features- The analysis of the language that is contextually significant to subject of the written work.  Examples include the use of slang or acronyms that are specific to a crime like pirating software or hacking.
:*idiosyncratic features- The analysis of errors and other ungrammatical elements that may be unique to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbasi|first1=Ahmed|last2=Chen|first2=Hsinchun|last3=Nunamaker Jr.|first3=Jay F.|title=Stylometric Identification in Electronic Markets: Scalability and Robustness|journal=Journal of Management Information System|date=Summer 2008|volume=25|issue=1|pages=49–78|jstor=40398926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the five features above are the traditional methods of author identification, there are features unique to online text. Features such as choice in font, the use of emojis, and links to other websites all provide a path to identification which is absent in traditional text analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rehmeyer|first1=Juli|title=Digital Fingerprints|journal=Science News|date=Jan 13, 2007|volume=171|issue=2|pages=26–28|jstor=3982506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
