[[File:Illustration of A weighting.ogv|thumb|400px|right|Video illustrating A-weighting by analyzing a sine sweep (contains audio)]]

'''A-weighting''' is the most commonly used of a family of curves defined in the International standard [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61672:2003 and various national standards relating to the measurement of [[sound pressure level]]. A-weighting is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative [[loudness]] perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies.  It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by [[octave band|octave]] or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in [[Decibel|dB]]. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A).  Other weighting sets of values – B, C, D and now Z – are discussed below.

The curves were originally defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended only for the measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 [[phon]]), is now commonly used for the measurement of [[environmental noise]] and [[industrial noise]], as well as when assessing potential [[Noise-induced hearing loss|hearing damage]] and other [[noise health effects]] at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation with occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech. It is also used when measuring low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States.{{Citation needed lead|date=July 2010}} In Britain, Europe and many other parts of the world, broadcasters and audio engineers{{Who|date=July 2010}} more often use the [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]], which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the [[BBC]] and other organizations.  This research showed that our ears respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C weightings were based are really only valid for pure single tones.{{citation needed lead|date=July 2012}}

== History ==

A-weighting began with work by [[Fletcher–Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] which resulted in their publication, in 1933, of a set of [[equal-loudness contours]]. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for [[sound level meter]]s.&lt;ref name=Pierre&gt;{{citation |url= http://storeycountywindfarms.org/ref3_Impact_Sound_Pressure.pdf |author=Richard L. St. Pierre, Jr. and Daniel J. Maguire |title=The Impact of A-weighting Sound Pressure Level Measurements during the Evaluation of Noise Exposure |date=July 2004 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ANSI]] standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Deficiencies ==
A-weighting is valid to represent the sensitivity of the human ear as a function of the frequency of pure tones, but only for relatively quiet levels of sound. In effect, the A-weighting is based on the 40-phon [[Fletcher–Munson curves]] which represented an early determination of the [[equal-loudness contour]] for human hearing. However, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation between the A scale and occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech, this scale is employed in many juridictions to evaluate the risks of occupational deafness and other auditory problems related to signals or speech intelligibility in noisy environnements. 

Because of perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) recently revised its standard curves as defined in ISO 226, in response to the recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher–Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15&amp;nbsp;dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons that are not explained. Fortuitously, the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve is particularly close to the modern ISO 226:2003 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210848/http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=Precise and Full-range Determination of Two-dimensional Equal Loudness Contours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it will be noted that A-weighting would be a better match to the loudness curve if it fell much more steeply above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, and it is likely that this compromise came about because steep filters were difficult to construct in the early days of electronics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nowadays, no such limitation need exist, as demonstrated by the ITU-R 468 curve. If A-weighting is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present. Accurate measurements therefore require a 20&amp;nbsp;kHz low-pass filter to be combined with the A-weighting curve in modern instruments. This is defined in IEC 61012 as AU weighting and while very desirable, is rarely fitted to commercial sound level meters.

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

A-frequency-weighting is mandated by the international standard IEC 61672 to be fitted to all sound level meters. The old B- and D-frequency-weightings have fallen into disuse, but many sound level meters provide for C frequency-weighting and its fitting is mandated &amp;mdash; at least for testing purposes &amp;mdash; to precision (Class one) sound level meters. D-frequency-weighting was specifically designed for use when measuring high level aircraft noise in accordance with the [[IEC 537]] measurement standard. The large peak in the D-weighting curve is not a feature of the equal-loudness contours, but reflects the fact that humans hear random noise differently from pure tones, an effect that is particularly pronounced around 6&amp;nbsp;kHz. This is because individual neurons from different regions of the [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]] respond to narrow bands of frequencies, but the higher frequency neurons integrate a wider band and hence signal a louder sound when presented with noise containing many frequencies than for a single pure tone of the same pressure level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Following changes to the ISO standard, D-frequency-weighting should now only be used for non-bypass engines and as these are not fitted to commercial aircraft &amp;mdash; but only to military ones &amp;mdash; A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for light civilian aircraft measurements, while a more accurate loudness-corrected weighting [[EPNdB]] is required for certification of large transport aircraft&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icao.int/Meetings/EnvironmentalWorkshops/Documents/NoiseCertificationWorkshop-2004/BIP_2_2_jb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Z- or ZERO frequency-weighting was introduced in the International Standard IEC 61672 in 2003 and was intended to replace the "Flat" or "Linear" frequency weighting often fitted by manufacturers. This change was needed as each sound level meter manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with &amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;dB points at 31.5&amp;nbsp;Hz and 8&amp;nbsp;kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk)

B- and D-frequency-weightings are no longer described in the body of the standard IEC 61672 : 2003, but their frequency responses can be found in the older IEC 60651, although that has been formally withdrawn by the International Electro-technical Commission in favour of IEC 61672 : 2003. The frequency weighting tolerances in IEC 61672 have been tightened over those in the earlier standards IEC 179 and IEC 60651 and thus instruments complying with the earlier specifications should no longer be used for legally required measurements.

== Environmental and other noise measurements ==
[[File:Atlas Copco XAHS 347-pic7-Max. sound power level.jpg|thumb|100px|Label related to a portable air compressor]]
A-weighted [[decibel]]s are abbreviated '''dB(A)''' or '''dBA.''' When acoustic (calibrated microphone) measurements are being referred to, then the units used will be [[decibel|dB]] [[sound pressure level|SPL]] referenced to
20 micropascals = 0&amp;nbsp;dB SPL. '''[[dBrn]] adjusted''' is not a synonym for dBA, but for dBa (in telecommunications dBa denotes "decibels adjusted" i.e. weighted absolute noise power, which has nothing to do with A-weighting).

The A-weighting curve has been widely adopted for [[environmental noise]] measurement, and is standard in many sound level meters. The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include [[roadway noise]], rail noise, [[aircraft noise]]). A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential [[Hearing impairment|hearing damage]] caused by loud noise.

A-weighted SPL measurements of noise level are increasingly found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and computer fans. In Europe, the A-weighted noise level is used for instance for normalizing the noise of tires on cars.

The A-weighting is also used for [[Noise dosimeter|noise dose]] measurements at work. A noise level of more than 85 dB(A) each day increases the risk factor for [[hearing damage]]. 

Noise exposure for visitors of venues with loud music is usually also expressed in dB(A), although the presence of high levels of low frequency noise does not justify this.

== Audio reproduction and broadcasting equipment ==

Although the A-weighting curve, in widespread use for [[noise measurement]], is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=Researches in loudness measurement |doi=10.1109/TAU.1966.1161864}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by [[Human brain|the brain]] to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and a downward tilt below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.

This enhanced sensitivity to noise in the region of 6&amp;nbsp;kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of [[compact cassette]] recorders and [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B noise reduction]]. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6&amp;nbsp;kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10&amp;nbsp;kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19&amp;nbsp;kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.

[[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness of all types of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the [[BBC]] Research Department, and was standardised by the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] and later adopted by many other standards bodies ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[British Standards Institution|BSI]]) and, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by [[Dolby Laboratories]] who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting are less accepted in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It is used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.

== Function realisation of some common weightings ==
The standard&lt;ref name="IEC61672"&gt;{{cite book|title=IEC 61672-1:2013 Electroacoustics - Sound level meters - Part 1: Specifications|date=2013|publisher=IEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines weightings (&lt;math&gt;A(f),C(f)&lt;/math&gt;) in dB units by tables with tolerance limits (to allow a variety of implementations). Additionally the underlying weighting functions &lt;math&gt;R_X(f)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="IEC61672" /&gt; to calculate the weightings are described in the standard. The weighting function &lt;math&gt;R_X(f)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the amplitude spectrum (not the intensity spectrum) of the unweighted sound level. Appropriate weighting functions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cross-spectrum.com/audio/weighting.html |title=Frequency weighting equations |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xZXWNqVh?url=http://www.cross-spectrum.com/audio/weighting.html |archivedate=2011-03-30 |publisher=Cross Spectrum |year=2004 |deadurl=no |df= }}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offsets (approximately −2.0, −0.17 and −0.06 for A, B and C, respectively) ensure the normalisation to 0&amp;nbsp;dB at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Precisely, the respective offset values are 
&lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_A(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_B(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_C(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

They are not defined in this way though, being defined by tables of values with tolerances in the standards documents, thus allowing different realisations:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===A===

:&lt;math&gt;H_A(s)= {k_A \cdot s^4\over(s+129.4)^2\quad(s+676.7)\quad (s+4636)\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 7.39705&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===B===
:&lt;math&gt;H_B(s)= {k_B \cdot s^3\over(s+129.4)^2\quad (s+995.9)\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.99185&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===C===
:&lt;math&gt;H_C(s)= {k_C \cdot s^2\over(s+129.4)^2\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.91797&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===D===
:&lt;math&gt;H_D(s)= {k_D \cdot s \cdot (s^2 + 6532 s + 4.0975 \times 10^7)\over(s+1776.3)\quad (s+7288.5)\quad (s^2 + 21514 s + 3.8836 \times 10^8)}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 91104.32

The ''k'' values are constants which are used to normalize the function to a gain of 1 (0&amp;nbsp;dB). The values listed above normalize the functions to 0&amp;nbsp;dB at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, as they are typically used. (This normalization is shown in the image.)

It was later generalized by Haris Aziz to handle the case where agents may express indifferences.&lt;ref name="h15"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s40505-015-0089-1|title=A generalization of the AL method for fair allocation of indivisible objects|journal=Economic Theory Bulletin|volume=4|issue=2|pages=307|year=2015|last1=Aziz|first1=Haris|arxiv=1409.6765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assumptions ==
The AL procedure requires the following assumptions on the people:
* Each person can rank the items from best to worst (i.e., each person can report a strict [[preference (economics)|preference relation]] on the items).
* Each person has a preference relation on bundles of items which is compatible with the [[responsive set extension]] of the ordering on items.

== Requirements ==
It is ''not'' assumed that the people can report their preference relation on bundles. There are many bundles, and it may be difficult to report a ranking on all of them.

Therefore, the procedure should return an allocation that is envy-free for ''every'' preference relation that is consistent with the item ranking and with weak additivity. In other words, the procedure should return an allocation that is ''necessarily envy-free'' (NEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ComSoc Handbook 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303}}

Suppose the two people are Alice and George. An allocation is ''NEF for Alice'' if there is an injection ''f'' from George's items to Alice's items, such that for each item ''x'' received by George, Alice prefers ''f''(''x'') to ''x''. An allocation is ''NEF for George'' if the symmetric property is satisfied. An item assignment is ''NEF'' if it is NEF for both partners. Note that in a NEF assignment, Alice and George receive the same number of items.

The empty allocation is obviously NEF, but it is very inefficient. Therefore, we are looking for an allocation that is "best" among all NEF allocations. A NEF allocation is called [[Pareto-efficient]] if there is no other NEF allocation that is better for one person and not worse for the other one.

== The BT procedure ==
As an introduction, consider the following simple division procedure:

* Put all items on the table.
* While there are items on the table, do:
** Ask the partners to choose their favorite item from all items on the table.
** If the choices are different, then give each partner his/her favorite item and continue.
** If the choices are identical, then send the chosen item to the Contested Pile. It will not be allocated.

This procedure returns a NEF allocation. It is very simple but not very efficient, since many items are discarded to the contested pile. The AL procedure is slightly more complicated, but it guarantees that the contested pile is never larger, and may be smaller than under BT.

== The AL procedure ==
The AL procedure works similarly to the BT procedure, but, before moving an item to the contested pile, it tries to allocate it to one partner while compensating the other partner with another item. Only if this doesn't succeed, the item is sent to the contested pile.

For example, suppose there are four items (1, 2, 3, 4) and the preferences of the partners are:
* Alice: 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4
* George: 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 1

The BT procedure gives 1 to Alice and 2 to George, since these are their favorites and they are different. Then, both Alice and George choose 3 so it is discarded. Then, both choose 4 so it is also discarded. The final allocation is: Alice←{1}, George←{2}. It is NEF but not PE.

The AL procedure also starts by giving 1 to Alice and 2 to George. Then, instead of discarding item 3, it is given to Alice, and George is compensated with item 4. The final allocation is: Alice&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;{1,3}, George&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;{2,4}. It is NEF and PE.

Both procedures are manipulable: a partner can gain by reporting incorrect preferences. However, such manipulation requires knowledge of the other partner's preferences, so it is difficult in practice.

== The AL procedure with indifferences ==
The original AL procedure crucially relies on the assumption that the item rankings are strict.

&lt;ref name="h15"/&gt; generalizes this procedure to general rankings, with possible indifferences.

'''Allegany College of Maryland''' (or '''ACM''') is a two-year public community college located in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Maryland]]. It was previously known as '''Allegany Community College''' (or '''ACC''').

== History ==

Allegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as "Allegany Community College" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed by the Allegany County Board of Education. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County under the direction of ACM’s first president, Dr. Robert S. Zimmer.

In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students.

The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]] Campus in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]]) and 1990 ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]] Campus in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]]). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002.

The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses.

On January 17, 2017 it was announced that the Somerset location will close following the Spring 2017 semester.

== Programs ==

The College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition.

== Athletics ==
The College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four-year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electroniccampus.org/CampusTour/undergraduate/1256/Allegany_College_of_Maryland/Allegany_College_of_Maryland1.html Electronic Campus - Select a College - Campus Tours - Allegany College of Maryland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance and accreditation ==
The [[Maryland Higher Education Commission]] (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the [[Governor of Maryland|Governor of the State of Maryland]], governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]) and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]).

The college is a member of the [[Maryland Association of Community Colleges]] (MACC) and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by MHEC. The [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somerset counties and to the academic programs they offer.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

[[Image:Vitis labrusca BB-1913.png|thumb|''[[Vitis labrusca]]'']]

'''Ampelography'''  ([[Ampelos|ἄμπελος]], "vine" + γράφος, "writing") is the field of [[botany]] concerned with the identification and classification of grapevines, [[Vitis|''Vitis'' spp.]] Traditionally this has been done by comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting.

==Early history==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2016}}The grape vine is an extremely variable [[species]] and some [[:Category:Grape varieties|varieties]], such as [[Pinot noir|Pinot]], [[mutate]] particularly frequently. At the same time, the wine and table grape industries have been important since ancient times, so large sums of money can depend on the correct identification of different varieties and clones of grapevines.

The science of ampelography began seriously in the 19th century, when it became important to understand more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as [[phylloxera]].

Many vine identification books were published at this time, one of which is Victor Rendu's ''Ampélographie française'' of 1857, featuring hand-colored lithographs by Eugene Grobon.

==Pierre Galet==
Until the Second World War, ampelography had been an art. Then [[Pierre Galet]] of the ''École nationale supérieure agronomique de [[Montpellier]]'' made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system was based on the shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective.

Galet then published the definitive book, ''Ampélographie pratique'', in 1952, featuring 9,600 types of vine. ''Ampélographie pratique'' was translated into English by Lucie Morton, published in 1979 and updated in 2000.

==''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography''==
In 2012, Italian publisher L'Artistica Editrice published ''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography'', a three volume set which contains the most important books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the ''Ampélographie'' of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of ''Pomona Italiana'' by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the ''Ampelografia Italiana'' of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes from all over the world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infowine.com/default.asp?scheda=11209 Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography] InfoWine. Retrieved: 2012-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA==
[[Carole Meredith]] at the [[University of California, Davis]], pioneered the use of [[genetic fingerprinting]] for vine identification.  Famous successes with the technique include proving the identity of [[Zinfandel]], Primitivo, and Crljenak Kaštelanski, and identifying the parents of [[Sangiovese]] as Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. Such exercises are giving valuable insight into historical patterns of trade and migration.

DNA fingerprinting uses segments of DNA that do not affect the look or taste of the grapes.  More recent work has identified the [[gene]]s responsible for the differences between grape varieties, such as the ''VvMYBA1'' and ''VvMYBA2'' genes that control grape colour, or the ''VvGAI1'' gene that is [[mutation|mutated]] in some cells of [[Pinot Meunier]] compared to [[Pinot noir]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17707">'''Artificial intelligence and law''' ('''AI and law''') is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) mainly concerned with applications of AI to [[legal informatics]] problems and original research on those problems.  It is also concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export tools and techniques developed in the context of legal problems to AI in general. For example, theories of legal decision making, especially models of [[argumentation theory|argumentation]], have contributed to [[knowledge representation and reasoning]]; models of social organization based on norms have contributed to [[multi-agent systems]]; reasoning with legal cases has contributed to [[case-based reasoning]]; and the need to store and retrieve large amounts of textual data has resulted in contributions to conceptual [[information retrieval]] and intelligent databases.

=== Formal models of legal reasoning ===

Formal models of legal texts and legal reasoning have been used in AI and Law to clarify issues, to give a more precise understanding and to provide a basis for implementations. A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor&lt;ref&gt;H. Prakken and G.Sartor, [http://www.cs.uu.nl/groups/IS/archive/henry/ReviewLogicAndLawRevised.pdf Law and logic: A review from an argumentation perspective], Artificial Intelligence. Available on-line June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, and has an excellent set of references.

An important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as "and" and "or" can be unclear (legal drafters do not observe the mathematical conventions in this respect). "Unless" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write "if and only if", although this is often what they intend by "if". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.&lt;ref name="allen57" /&gt;

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand on AI and Law work involved the production of executable models of legislation. Originating in the LEGOL work of Ronald Stamper&lt;ref name="stamper77" /&gt;  the idea was to represent legislation using a formal language and to use this formalisation (typically with some sort of user interface to gather the facts of a particular case) as the basis for an expert system. This became popular, mainly using the Horn Clause subset of first order predicate calculus. In particular Sergot et al.'s representation of the British Nationality Act&lt;ref name="sergot1986" /&gt; did much to popularise the approach. In fact, as later work showed, this was an untypically suitable piece of legislation on which to employ the approach: it was new, and so had not been amended, relatively simple and almost all of the concepts were non-technical. Later work, such as that on Supplementary Benefits,&lt;ref&gt;T.J.M. Bench-Capon, G.O. Robinson, T.W. Routen, M.J. Sergot, Logic programming for large scale applications in law: a formalisation of supplementary benefit legislation, in: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1987, pp. 190–198.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that larger, more complicated (containing many cross references, exceptions, counterfactuals, and deeming provisions), legislation which used many highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions) and which had been the subject of many amendments produced a far less satisfactory final system. Some efforts were made to improve matters from a software engineering perspective, especially to handle problems such as cross reference, verification and frequent amendment. The use of hierarchical representations&lt;ref&gt;T. Routen, T.J.M. Bench-Capon, Hierarchical formalizations, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 35 (1991) 69–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  was suggested to address the first problem, and so-called isomorphic&lt;ref&gt;T.J.M. Bench-Capon, F.P. Coenen, Isomorphism and legal knowledge based systems, Artificial Intelligence and Law 1 (1992) 65–86.&lt;/ref&gt; representation was intended to address the other two. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became largely absorbed in the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Gruber: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0256/614d1dc55962708db9b791f70a29370f1d76.pdf The Role of Common Ontology in Achieving Sharable, Reusable Knowledge Bases]. Knowledge Representation 1991: 601-602&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontology&lt;ref&gt;Valente, A. 1995. Legal Knowledge Engineering; A Modelling Approach, IOS Press, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. van Kralingen, Pepijn R. S. Visser, Trevor J. M. Bench-Capon, [[H. Jaap van den Herik]]: A principled approach to developing legal knowledge systems. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. 51(6): 1127-1154 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, Alexander Boer: [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-321/LOAIT07-Proceedings.pdf#page=43 The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts].  Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Legal Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence Techniques. 2007: 43-63&lt;/ref&gt; to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.

Since law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Jones, M.J. Sergot, On the characterisation of law and computer systems: the normative systems perspective, in: J.-J.Ch. Meyer, R. Wieringa (Eds.), Deontic Logic in Computer Science: Normative System Specification, Wiley, 1993, pp. 275–307&lt;/ref&gt; In law directed obligations,&lt;ref&gt;H. Herrestad, C. Krogh, Obligations directed from bearers to counterparties, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1995, pp. 210–218.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby an obligation is owed to another named individual are of particular interest, since violations of such obligations are often the basis of legal proceedings.  There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Sergot, A computational theory of normative positions, ACM Trans. Comput. Log. 2 (2001) 581–622.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[multi-agent system]]s, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Esteva, Juan A. Rodríguez-Aguilar, Josep Lluís Arcos, Carles Sierra, Pere Garcia: Institutionalizing Open Multi-Agent Systems. ICMAS 2000: 381–382&lt;/ref&gt; the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Modgil, Nir Oren, Noura Faci, Felipe Meneguzzi, Simon Miles and Michael Luck, [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/6046/JournalMonitoring3.pdf?sequence=1 Monitoring Compliance with E-Contracts and Norms], Artificial Intelligence and Law 23(2) (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Law often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus&lt;ref&gt;R. Hernandez Marin, G. Sartor, [https://www.academia.edu/download/42420341/Time_and_norms_a_formalisation_in_the_ev20160208-3430-19hoaxl.pdf Time and norms: a formalisation in the event-calculus], in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.&lt;ref&gt;G. Governatori, A. Rotolo, G. Sartor, [https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9579/ic05.pdf Temporalised normative positions in defeasible logic], in: Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 2005, pp. 25–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Schauer, Frederick. "On the supposed defeasibility of legal rules." Current Legal Problems 51.1 (1998): 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prakken, Henry, and Giovanni Sartor. "The three faces of defeasibility in the law." Ratio Juris 17.1 (2004): 118-139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Loui: [https://uisacad5.uis.edu/~rloui2/pdfs/V12n2Computers.pdf Paths to Defeasibility:  Reply to Schauer on Hart].  APA 12:2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, negation of failure is often used to handle non-monotonicity,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kowalski: [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/papers/negation%20legislation.pdf The Treatment of Negation in Logic Programs for Representing Legislation]. Proceedings of Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law. 1989: 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logic&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Johnston, Guido Governatori: Induction of Defeasible Logic Theories in the Legal Domain. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2003:204–213&lt;/ref&gt; have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation,&lt;ref&gt;Phan Minh Dung: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029400041X On the Acceptability of Arguments and its Fundamental Role in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Logic Programming and n-Person Games]. Artificial Intelligence 77(2): 321–358 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; however, these concerns have been addressed through argumentation rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.

The drug is not tested for nor banned by any sporting organization.&amp;nbsp;... Wilson et al. [91] demonstrated that when non-resistance trained males received HMB pre-exercise, the rise of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels reduced, and HMB tended to decrease soreness. Knitter et al. [92] showed a decrease in LDH and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), a byproduct of muscle breakdown, by HMB after a prolonged run.&amp;nbsp;... The utility of HMB does seem to be affected by timing of intake prior to workouts and dosage [97]. Further, chronic consumption of HMB appears safe [97].&amp;nbsp;...

===Pharmacodynamics===

Several components of the [[signaling cascade]] that mediates the HMB-induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name="Pimentel 2017 systematic review on HMB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 591 | issue = 11 | pages = 2911–2923 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23551944 | pmc = 3690694 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.253203 | quote = The stimulation of MPS through mTORc1-signalling following HMB exposure is in agreement with pre-clinical studies (Eley et al. 2008).&amp;nbsp;... Furthermore, there was clear divergence in the amplitude of phosphorylation for 4EBP1 (at Thr37/46 and Ser65/Thr70) and p70S6K (Thr389) in response to both Leu and HMB, with the latter showing more pronounced and sustained phosphorylation.&amp;nbsp;...  Nonetheless, as the overall MPS response was similar, this cellular signalling distinction did not translate into statistically distinguishable anabolic effects in our primary outcome measure of MPS.&amp;nbsp;... Interestingly, although orally supplied HMB produced no increase in plasma insulin, it caused a depression in MPB (−57%). Normally, postprandial decreases in MPB (of ~50%) are attributed to the nitrogen-sparing effects of insulin since clamping insulin at post-absorptive concentrations (5&amp;nbsp;μU&amp;nbsp;ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) while continuously infusing AAs (18&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not suppress MPB (Greenhaff et al. 2008), which is why we chose not to measure MPB in the Leu group, due to an anticipated hyperinsulinaemia (Fig. 3C). Thus, HMB reduces MPB in a fashion similar to, but independent of, insulin. These findings are in-line with reports of the anti-catabolic effects of HMB suppressing MPB in pre-clinical models, via attenuating proteasomal-mediated proteolysis in response to LPS (Eley et al. 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to HMB's [[Precursor (chemistry)|metabolic precursor]], {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}}, HMB has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via [[phosphorylation]] of the [[mechanistic target of rapamycin]] (mTOR) and subsequent activation of {{abbrlink|mTORC1|mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1}}, which leads to [[Translation (biology)|protein biosynthesis]] in cellular [[ribosome]]s via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (i.e., the [[p70S6 kinase]] and the [[protein translation|translation]] repressor protein [[4EBP1]]).{{#tag:ref|Approximately equal doses of pure {{abbr|HMB-FA|β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid}} (2.42&amp;nbsp;grams) and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} (3.42&amp;nbsp;grams) do not produce statistically distinguishable anabolic effects, as measured by the [[fractional synthesis]] of [[myofibril|myofibrillar proteins]], in the skeletal muscle of living humans.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review" /&gt; At 150&amp;nbsp;minutes post-ingestion, these doses of HMB-FA and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} increased muscle protein synthesis by ~70% and ~110% respectively in one study.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Advances in Nutrition | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 452–460 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26178029 | pmc = 4496741 | doi = 10.3945/an.115.008367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook MS, Wilkinson DJ, Phillips BE, Perez-Schindler J, Philp A, Smith K, Atherton PJ | title = Skeletal muscle homeostasis and plasticity in youth and ageing: impact of nutrition and exercise | journal = Acta Physiologica | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–41 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26010896 | pmc = 4843955 | doi = 10.1111/apha.12532 | quote = The mechanisms underlying the anabolic effects of food intake involve both the stimulation of MPS (Rennie et al. 1982) and suppression of MPB (Wilkes et al. 2009). The potent increase in MPS is driven almost entirely by essential amino acids (EAAs) (Smith et al. 1992), with the branched chain AA (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine and valine), in particular leucine [and its metabolite(s), e.g. β‐hydroxy β‐methylbutyric acid (HMB) (Van Koevering &amp; Nissen 1992)] being central to these effects (Wilkinson et al. 2013). Although the mechanisms underlying the unique anabolic properties of leucine are incompletely defined, recent work in yeast and cultured mammalians cells has demonstrated that leucyl tRNA synthetase is upstream of activating the hitherto ‘cellular AA sensor’, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to leucine (Bonfils et al. 2012, Han et al. 2012). This was reaffirmed by experiments showing that of all the EAAs, leucine is the most effective EAA in increasing the activity (i.e. phosphorylation) of mTORC1 (Atherton et al. 2010b) and its substrates. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muscle atrophy-related signal transduction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutt V, Gupta S, Dabur R, Injeti E, Mittal A | title = Skeletal muscle atrophy: Potential therapeutic agents and their mechanisms of action | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 99 | issue =  | pages = 86–100 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26048279 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2015.05.010 | quote = In an experimental animal model of cancer-induced cachexia, HMB treatment not only down-regulated the expression of key regulatory components of 19S and 20S proteasome–proteolytic pathway but also stimulated protein synthesis which further regulates the loss of muscle mass [40].&amp;nbsp;...

This is important under stressful conditions when muscle cells may lack the capacity to produce adequate amounts of the cholesterol that is essential to proper functioning of cell membranes. Many biochemical studies have shown that HMB may be a precursor of cholesterol synthesis (Bachhawat et al., 1955; Bloch et al., 1954; Coon et al., 1955; Adamson and Greenberg, 1955; Gey et al., 1957). According to pertinent literature, HMB carbon is incorporated into cholesterol. Therefore, increased intramuscular HMB concentrations may provide readily available substrate for the cholesterol synthesis that is needed to form and stabilize the sarcolemma.&amp;nbsp;... It is known that HMB supplementation decreases post-exercise levels of enzymes, indicating muscle damage, such as creatinine phosphokinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which suggests an enhancement of the muscle cell membrane function. This was shown in numerous studies in humans undergoing both resistance and endurance training (Wilson et al., 2013)&amp;nbsp;... In theory, HMB use as a precursor to cholesterol could aid in stabilizing muscle cell membranes; however, this has not been confirmed by research studies.

===Biosynthesis===
&lt;noinclude&gt;
HMB is synthesized in the human body through the [[metabolism]] of [[leucine|{{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}}]], a [[branched-chain amino acid]].&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt; &lt;/noinclude&gt;In healthy individuals, approximately&amp;nbsp;60% of dietary {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} is metabolized after several hours, with roughly 5% ({{nowrap|2–10%}}&amp;nbsp;range) of dietary {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} being converted to {{if pagename|Leucine=[[β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid]] (HMB)|other=HMB}}.&lt;ref name="HMB athletic performance-related effects 2011 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Molecular Aspects of Medicine 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brioche T, Pagano AF, Py G, Chopard A|date=August 2016|title=Muscle wasting and aging: Experimental models, fatty infiltrations, and prevention|url=|journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine|volume=50|issue=|pages=56–87|doi=10.1016/j.mam.2016.04.006|pmid=27106402|quote=&lt;!--HMB can decrease apoptosis, judging by a dramatic decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the soleus and plantaris of hindlimb-unloaded old rats treated with HMB, as compared to a placebo group.&amp;nbsp;... Similar data were obtained in muscle cell cultures (Kornasio et al., 2009).&amp;nbsp;...--&gt; In conclusion, HMB treatment clearly appears to be a safe potent strategy against sarcopenia, and more generally against muscle wasting, because HMB improves muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance. It seems that HMB is able to act on three of the four major mechanisms involved in muscle deconditioning (protein turnover, apoptosis, and the regenerative process), whereas it is hypothesized to strongly affect the fourth (mitochondrial dynamics and functions). Moreover, HMB is inexpensive (~30– 50 US dollars per month at 3 g per day) and may prevent osteopenia (Bruckbauer and Zemel, 2013; Tatara, 2009; Tatara et al., 2007, 2008, 2012) and decrease cardiovascular risks (Nissen et al., 2000). For all these reasons, HMB should be routinely used in muscle-wasting conditions especially in aged people.&amp;nbsp;... 3&amp;nbsp;g of CaHMB taken three times a day (1&amp;nbsp;g each time) is the optimal posology, which allows for continual bioavailability of HMB in the body (Wilson et al., 2013)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; Around&amp;nbsp;40% of dietary {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} is converted to {{nowrap|acetyl-CoA}}, which is subsequently used in the synthesis of other compounds.&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

The vast majority of {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} metabolism is initially catalyzed by the [[branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase]] enzyme, producing {{nowrap|[[α-ketoisocaproate]]}} (α-KIC).&lt;ref name="HMB athletic performance-related effects 2011 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanchi NE, Gerlinger-Romero F, Guimarães-Ferreira L, de Siqueira Filho MA, Felitti V, Lira FS, Seelaender M, Lancha AH | title = HMB supplementation: clinical and athletic performance-related effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 1015–1025 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20607321 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-010-0678-0 | quote = HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine (Van Koverin and Nissen 1992), an essential amino acid. The first step in HMB metabolism is the reversible transamination of leucine to [α-KIC] that occurs mainly extrahepatically (Block and Buse 1990). Following this enzymatic reaction, [α-KIC] may follow one of two pathways. In the first, HMB is produced from [α-KIC] by the cytosolic enzyme KIC dioxygenase (Sabourin and Bieber 1983). The cytosolic dioxygenase has been characterized extensively and differs from the mitochondrial form in that the dioxygenase enzyme is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas the dehydrogenase enzyme is found exclusively in the mitochondrion (Sabourin and Bieber 1981, 1983). Importantly, this route of HMB formation is direct and completely dependent of liver KIC dioxygenase. Following this pathway, HMB in the cytosol is first converted to cytosolic β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which can then be directed for cholesterol synthesis (Rudney 1957) (Fig. 1). In fact, numerous biochemical studies have shown that HMB is a precursor of cholesterol (Zabin and Bloch 1951; Nissen et al. 2000).&lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the second pathway, after transamination, [α-KIC] in liver generates isovaleryl-CoA through the enzymatic action of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) and after several steps, there is production of HMG-CoA through the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (Fig. 1). Under normal conditions the majority of KIC is converted into isovaleryl-CoA, in which approximately 5% of leucine is metabolized into HMB (Wilson et al. 2008; Van Koverin and Nissen 1992). However, Nissen and Abumrad (1997) provided evidence that the primary fate of HMB is probably conversion to HMG-CoA in the liver, for cholesterol biosynthesis.--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors=Kohlmeier M | title=Nutrient Metabolism: Structures, Functions, and Genes | date=May 2015 | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-387784-0 | pages=385–388 | edition=2nd | section-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTQTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387&amp;q=beta-hydroxy%20beta-methylbutyrate%20HMB#v=onepage | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTQTAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage | accessdate=6 June 2016 | section=Leucine | quote=Energy fuel: Eventually, most Leu is broken down, providing about 6.0kcal/g.

The '''Bowden development''' is an urban development in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on a site formerly owned by the [[Clipsal]] corporation in the suburb of [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]], within the [[City of Charles Sturt]], in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metropolitan area]] 2.5 kilometres from the city centre. 

The site covers an area of {{convert|10.25|ha}} and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the [[Outer Harbor railway line]] to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/about/progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC41161|name=Bowden (State Suburb)|accessdate=2008-06-07| quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability initiatives==

The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] is a world's best practice rating tool from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]] covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Developer-Green-Star-Fact-Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/bowden-development/&lt;/ref&gt; including commercial buildings such as '''Plant 4 Bowden'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/plant-4-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/princes-terrace-adelaide/&lt;/ref&gt;, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design.

==History==
[[File:Bowden clipsal.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground]] 
The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]'s plans for eleven [[transport-oriented development]]s in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers in the realm of 75 to 80 million Australian dollars were expected however evidently not attained; as the [[2008 economic crisis]] accelerated and falling property prices diminished the likelihood of a sale at expected prices, the South Australian government intervened and announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id%3D3956%26print%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075532/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3956 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2008–2010===

In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site).

Both sites are located within the [[City of Charles Sturt]] and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: “Bowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and  integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/housing-for-clipsal-site/1342897.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden is served by [[Bowden railway station]], [[North Adelaide railway station]], buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] on Port Road, Hindmarsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-34.9043904,138.5777874,17z?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Charles visits Bowden SA.jpg|left|thumb|190x190px|Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden]]

===2011–2015===

In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved &lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bowden-tod-gets-the-nod/story-e6frea83-1226043678620 Adelaide Now].&lt;/ref&gt; and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012.

Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden’s first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets — Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets — opened to the public in May 2013.

In 2014, the restaurant '''Jarmer's Kitchen''' opened&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/jarmers-kitchen-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/first-residents-now-call-bowden-home/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] residential project, the '''Prince's Terraces Adelaide''' which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/princes-terrace-adelaide-breaking-ground/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowden Town Square opening in 2016.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Bowden Town Square opening community celebration]]

===2016-2017===

The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the [[Adelaide Park Lands]] across the road from Bowden in February 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/time-celebrate-bowdens-new-front-yard/&lt;/ref&gt; where the '''Park Terrace Community Garden''' currently resides.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/bowden-life/community-garden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting '''Bowden Park''', the '''Plant 4 Bowden''' retail hub and '''Plant 3''' community hub.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/bowden-moving-forward-500-homes-sold-new-developers-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

|quote= Background and contents
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies great natural or cultural value itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Oliver, and Piatti, Giovanna (ed.) ''World Heritage and
Buffer Zones'', International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and Buffer Zones Davos, Switzerland 11 – 14 March 2008 (Paris: UNESCO, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ebregt, Arthur and de Greve, Pol, ''Buffer Zones and their Management: Policy and Best Practices for Terrestrial Ecosystems in Developing Countries'' (Wageningen: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions (conservation) ==

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V. H.|date=1998-08|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641247|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=3|pages=559|doi=10.2307/2641247|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural [[wikt:drainage basin|watershed]] due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water. 

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A. T.|date=1990-02-20|title=Use of Riparian and Upland Habitats by Small Mammals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1381312|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=71|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.2307/1381312|issn=1545-1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater [[Turtle|turtles]], making them more dependent on the wetland environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Vincent J.|last2=Gibbons|first2=J. Whitfield|date=1995-12|title=Terrestrial Buffer Zones and Wetland Conservation: A Case Study of Freshwater Turtles in a Carolina Bay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1365–1369|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and [[Reptile|reptiles]], and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important. 

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

'''Carolingian art''' comes from the [[Frankish Empire]] in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900—during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important [[monasteries]] under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.

There was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and eventually [[Gothic art]] in the West.  The Carolingian era is part of the period in [[medieval art]] sometimes called the "[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]".  After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

==Overview==
[[File:Musée Picardie Médiéval 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Ivory plaque, probably from a book cover, [[Reims]] late 9th century, with two scenes from the life of [[Saint Remy]] and the Baptism of [[Clovis I|Clovis]]]]
Having established an Empire as large as the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the day, and rivaling in size the old [[Western Roman Empire]], the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or "sub-antique" as [[Ernst Kitzinger]] called it)&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 8&lt;/ref&gt; art still being produced in small quantities in [[Rome]] and a few other centres in Italy, which [[Charlemagne]] knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Rome in 800.

As symbolic representative of Rome he sought the ''renovatio'' (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic [[Migration period art]] could not.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] culture with his own.

But it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] controversy was dividing the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the [[Libri Carolini]] sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan [[idolatry]], Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art.

Reasonable numbers of Carolingian [[illuminated manuscript]]s and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of [[Insular art]] added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used [[interlace (visual arts)|interlacedecoration]], and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript.

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre-Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the [[Ottonian art]] of the next stable dynasty, in England with late [[Anglo-Saxon art]], after the threat from the [[Viking]]s was removed, and in Spain.

==Illuminated manuscripts==

{{See also|Key works of Carolingian illumination}}
The most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are [[illuminated manuscripts]]. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly [[Gospel book]]s, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], often including [[evangelist portrait]]s, and lavish [[canon tables]], following the precedent of the [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the [[Old Testament]], especially [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; [[New Testament]] scenes are more often found on the ivory [[relief]]s on the covers.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 69. Dodwell, 49 discusses the reasons for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the [[historiated initial]] further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period—notably in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. Luxury manuscripts were given [[treasure binding]]s or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on [[purple parchment]]. The [[Bern Physiologus]] is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the [[Vatican Terence]]. The [[Utrecht Psalter]], stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript.

Other liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]], but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The [[Chronography of 354]] was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century.

===Centres of illumination===
Carolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a [[Rheims]]ian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there.

[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Mark]] from the [[Ebbo Gospels]]]]

The Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the '''Ada School''') produced the earliest manuscripts, including the [[Godescalc Evangelistary]] (781–783); the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch|Lorsch Gospels]] (778–820); the [[Ada Gospels]]; the [[Soissons Gospels]]; the [[Harley Golden Gospels]] (800-820);  and the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]]; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from [[Ravenna]], Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained [[Migration Period art]] (Merovingian and [[Insular art|Insular]]) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships.

In the early 9th-century Archbishop [[Ebo of Rheims]], at [[Hautvillers]] (near [[Rheims]]), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The [[Gospel book of Ebbo]] (816–835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the ''[[Bern Physiologus]]'', the earliest Latin edition of the Christian [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period.

Another style developed at the monastery of [[St Martin of Tours]], in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for [[Charles the Bald]], called the [[Vivian Bible]]. The [[Tours]] School was cut short by the invasion of the [[Normans]] in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire.

[[File:Utrecht 15v 2.jpg|right|thumb|From the [[Utrecht Psalter]], 9th-century Naturalistic and energetic figurine line drawings were entirely new, and were to become the most influential innovation of Carolinian art in later periods.]]

The [[diocese of Metz]] was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a [[sacramentary]] was made for Bishop [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] called the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. The illuminated "historiated" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes.

In the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a [[Franco-Saxon]] style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century.

Charles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]] (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts.

With the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The [[Abbey of St. Gall]] created the [[Folchard Psalter]] (872) and the [[Golden Psalter]] (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions.

==Sculpture and metalwork==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|Gem-encrusted cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], 870]]

Luxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have [[treasure binding]]s—ornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels—sometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from [[consular diptych]]s and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the [[Lorsch Gospels]], which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin.

Important Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]]; the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles the Bald|Charles II (the Bald)]], and often called his "Palace School". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] outside Paris is one leading possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 60–68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arnulf Ciborium]] (a miniature [[ciborium (architecture)|architectural ciborium]] rather than the [[Ciborium (container)|vessel for hosts]]), now in the [[Munich Residenz]], is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in [[repoussé]] gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] dish in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64-65, 66-67; [[:File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|picture of the dish]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.

Charlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at [[Aachen]] which cast the doors for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]], in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically [[gilding|gilded]], as with the Ottonian [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].

One of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824–859), a ''[[paliotto]]'', in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver [[repoussé]], framed by borders of [[filigree]], precious stones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].

The [[Lothair Crystal]], of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of [[rock crystal]] which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Suzanna]].

==Mosaics and frescos==
[[File:Germigny Des Pres 2007 01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], [[Germigny-des-Prés]], c. 806, but restored. The subject seems drawn from illuminated Jewish bibles, and relates to the [[Libri Carolini]], possibly written by Theodulf, where the Ark is cited as divine approval of sacred images.]]
Sources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of [[Titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] show that their subject matter was primarily religious.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mosaic]]s installed in [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's palatine chapel]] showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the [[Evangelist's symbol]]s and the twenty-four elders from the [[Apocalypse]]. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the [[apse]] of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] at [[Germigny-des-Prés]] (806) which shows the [[Ark of the Covenant]] adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster.

The villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]]. It was destroyed later in the century, but had [[fresco]]s of the [[Seven liberal arts]], the [[season|Four Seasons]], and the [[Mappa Mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 13–17&lt;/ref&gt; We know from written sources of other [[fresco]]s in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the [[Liberal Arts]], as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of [[Louis the Pious]] at [[Ingelheim]] contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained [[Typology (theology)|typological]] scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another.

Fragmentary paintings have survived at [[Auxerre]], [[Coblenz]], [[Lorsch]], [[Cologne]], [[Fulda]], [[Corvey]], [[Trier]], [[Müstair]], [[Mals]], [[Naturns]], [[Cividale]], [[Brescia]] and [[Milan]].

==Spolia==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. Charlemagne's Court School.]]
[[File:Lothair Crystal AD 855-869 (Carolingian Empire).jpg|thumb|The [[Lothair Crystal]], mid-9th century]]
''[[Spolia]]'' is the Latin term for "spoils" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period.

Perhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Lateran Palace]]. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] and thus held great accord—Charlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from [[Ravenna]], then believed to be that of [[Theodoric the Great]], to Aachen, to match the statue of "Constantine" in Rome.

Antique [[carved gems]] were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original [[iconography]].

'''Church attendance''' is a central religious practice for many [[Christians]]; some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Catholic Church]] require church attendance on the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday); the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches [[first-day Sabbatarianism]],&lt;ref name="Wigley1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigley|first=John|title=The Rise and Fall of the Victorian Sunday|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719007941|page=800|quote=Following the formulation of the Westminster Confession, fully fledged Sabbatarianism quickly took root too, being embodied in an Act of 1661, then spreading northwards and westwards as the Highlands were opened up after the '45, during which time the doctrine lost its original force and vigour in the Lowlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus proclaiming the duty of public worship in keeping with the [[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name="McKim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=More Presbyterian Questions, More Presbyterian Answers: Exploring Christian Faith|year=2011|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664503086|page=72|quote=The Westminster Confession urges a strict observance of the Lord's Day as a day of rest and worship, away from "works, words, and thoughts" about "worldly employments and recreations."

The [[Lutheran]] Christian theologian [[:da:Balthasar Münter|Balthasar Münter]] stated that church attendance is the "foundation for the Christian life" as "the [[Christian Bible]] and the [[sacraments]] provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of [[backsliding]], as well as offers "the [[Communion (Christian)|company of other believers]]".&lt;ref name="Roos2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Merethe|title=Enlightened Preaching: Balthasar Münter’s Authorship 1772-1793|date=2013-03-08|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004249899|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on 1990-1991 data, it was estimated that the country with the highest rate of church attendance in the world was [[Nigeria]] (89%) and with the lowest - the Soviet Union (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_ratefor.htm How many people outside of North America go regularly to religious services?]&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria's data was notable, as Nigeria is very religiously diverse - the population is 50.1% Muslim and 48.2% Christian.

A survey commissioned by the ''Época Magazine'' in 2005 showed that 29% of [[Brazil]]ians attend church weekly, and indicated that it is lesser than in the United States but higher than in Western Europe and Japan, indeed showing that contrary to the local popular belief, Brazilians of the time could indeed be regarded as a religious people even in practice (though it is ponderable that the growth of the population declaring to be solely irreligious in nationwide censuses grew about 100% between 2000 and 2010, and 200% between 2000 and 2013, from 4% to 12%, and general secularization also grew among the portion of the population that remained religious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR70422-6014,00.html Época – O brasileiro em números {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210647/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEDR70422-6014%2C00.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006, ''Financial Times (FT)/Harris Poll'' conducted online surveyed 12,507 adults over 16 years old in the United States (2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed) and five European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain and Spain). The survey found that only 26% of those polled attended religious services "every week or more often", 9% went "once or twice a month", 21% went "a few times a year", 3% went "once a year", 22% went "less than once a year", and 18% never attend religious services. ''Harris Interactive'' stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to [[sampling error]]s and [[Non-response bias|non-response]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NEWS/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1130 |title=Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country, According to the Latest Financial Times/Harris Poll |publisher=Harrisinteractive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous nearly identical survey by Harris in 2003 found that only 26% of those surveyed attended religious services "every week or more often", 11% went "once or twice a month" 19% went "a few times a year", 4% went "once a year", 16% went "less than once a year", and 25% never attend religious services.

Calculating the church's average weekend attendance is important since it determines the size of a given church. For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes]. ''USA Churches.org''. Accessed on January 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternative definitions, such as house church, simple church, intentional community, were proposed by [[the Barna Group]], an American private consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barna.org/barna-update/congregations/45-new-statistics-on-church-attendance-and-avoidance New Statistics on Church Attendance and Avoidance]. ''Barna Group'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) A narrow definition of a regular church attendee can be viewed as a synonym for a Sunday service visitation, while a broad definition, names as a regular attendee a person who comes to church during three out of eight weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rebecca and Lindy Lowry.

===Attendance by country===
The frequency at which Christians attend church services varies greatly around the world. In some countries weekly attendance at religious services is common among Christians, while in others weekly attendance is rare. The following attendance statistics are mostly based on self-reporting surveys and may not accurately reflect real attendance figures.

[[File:Lucia procession.jpg|thumb|250px|A Swedish Christian girl leads a [[Christian procession|church procession]] on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]]]
Church attendance remains stronger among older demographics, and more common for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?sitemapid=137 Gender profile of church attenders].

The [[Pew Research Center]], which conducts the extensive research and information program ''Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life'', has linked regular church attendance with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/5-3/ How Income and Church Attendance Affects Happiness].

A 2005 European Union survey found that religious belief increased with age and was higher among women, those who were leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Iona Institute]] documented increasing church attendance in Ireland, despite sex-abuse scandals that plagued the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="The Iona Institute"&gt;[http://www.ionainstitute.eu/assets/files/Press_Release_by_The_Iona_Institute_2Nov2009-1.pdf ''Press Release by the Iona Institute'', 2 November 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest{{who|date=December 2016}} the rise is due to the effects of the economic recession.

Research shows that there is a correlation between church attendance and the level of education. For instance, in a Pew Research study from 1996, approximately 34% of high school dropouts went to church on a typical Sunday, while 44% of those with a college degree or higher did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/96KOHUT/96KOHUT_Var63_1.asp Religion and Politics Survey, 1996]. ''The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)''. Accessed on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of married individuals attended church on a typical Sunday, compared with 29% of divorced and 31% of never-married individuals. While it is likely that the well-educated and married might over-report their church attendance more often, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that they have maintained a stronger church-going identity than other Americans. A number of studies have been undertaken to examine the topic of [[religiosity and intelligence]] and religiosity and education. Studies also indicate that there is a higher rate of church attendance among married couples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Influence of parents ===

Several research studies in the USA and Europe found that church attendance practices of parents, especially fathers, can be highly influential in forming the future church attendance practices of their children.

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Fertility and Family Survey]] was commissioned by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)]] to enable Switzerland to take part in this international project launched by the [[UNECE Population Activities Unit]]. The survey was conducted between October 1994 and May 1995, with the results being published in 2000 by the [[Council of Europe]].  The results are representative of Switzerland's permanent resident population aged 20–49 and presented in the table below.&lt;ref name="HaugCourbage2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Haug|author2=Philippe Wanner|title=The Demographic Characteristics of National Minorities in Certain European States|url=https://book.coe.int/eur/en/population-studies-series/1949-the-demographic-characteristics-of-national-minorities-in-certain-european-states-volume-2-population-studies-no-31.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Population Studies No. 31|volume=Volume 2|date=January 2000|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Germany|isbn=978-92-871-4159-0|page=154|chapter=IV.

A non-practicing mother with a regular father will see a minimum of two-thirds of her children ending up at church. In contrast, a non-practicing father with a regular mother will see two-thirds of his children not attending church. If his wife is similarly irregular that figure rises to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Men &amp; Church | journal = Touchstone | date = June 2003 | first = Robbie | last = Low | volume = 16 | issue = 5| id=| url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-05-024-v |publisher= The Fellowship of St. James| accessdate = 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egan |first=Richard |url=http://www.ad2000.com.au/church_attendance_the_family_feminism_and_the_declining_role_of_fatherhood_september_2002 |title=Church Attendance: The family, feminism and the declining role of fatherhood |journal=AD2000 |volume=15 |issue=8 |date=September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When only the father attends Sunday school, 55% of the children attend when grown.
*When only the mother attends Sunday school, 15% of the children attend when grown.
*When neither parent attends Sunday school, only 6% of the children attend when grown.

An unrelated survey in the USA also found fathers to be highly influential in church attendance. It found that if a child is the first person in a household to become a Christian, there is a 3.5% probability everyone else in the household will follow. If the mother is the first to become a Christian, there is a 17% probability everyone else in the household will follow. However, when the father is first, there is a 93% probability everyone else in the household will follow.&lt;ref name="HornerRalston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bob Horner|author2=Ron Ralston|author3=David Sunde|title=The promise keeper at work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CglElq-WtecC|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Promise Builders Study Series|date=December 1996|publisher=Focus on the Family Publishing|isbn=978-1-56179-451-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=15630 | title = Baptist Press: Want your church to grow?

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.&lt;ref name="Christian Research Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801010204/http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000242.cgi Why People Don't Go to Church... ].

An article published in the ''Christianity Today Magazine'' emphasized that at least in America church attendance since the 1990s has remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Baker. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/novemberweb-only/145-42.0.html Is Church Attendance Declining?], 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 50% of Americans replied that God is very important in their lives, comparing with 40% of Irish, 28% of Canadians, 26% of Spaniards, 21% of Australians, and 10% of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Michele.

Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percent of Americans who regularly attend religious services has fluctuated over time, but presently is at a low point.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx Five Key Findings on Religion in the US], Gallup Poll (December 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gallup Poll]] surveys, the yearly aggregate of those who answer "yes" to the question "Did you, yourself, happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days, or not?" was 36% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx Religion], Gallup Poll (last accessed May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very long-running Gallup question: "In 1939, when Gallup first asked this question, 41% said 'yes.' That percentage dropped to 37% in 1940 and rose to 39% in 1950. It continued to climb, reaching as high as 49% at multiple points in the 1950s. Attendance then settled down to figures around 40% for decades, before dropping to 36%" beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name="Newport"/&gt;

The decline in church attendance is more pronounced in developed European countries, where it is suggested that the secular culture overrides interest in religion. In Poland Church attendance has declined from more than 50% in 1979 to 40% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Praktyki niedzielne Polaków (dominicantes)|url = http://iskk.pl/kosciolnaswiecie/211-praktyki-niedzielne-polakow-dominicantes.html|website = iskk.pl|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the early 1990s, American sociologists Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves found that weekly attendance at Protestant and Catholic churches in one rural county in [[Ohio]] was only about 20%, whereas self-reported church attendance was 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadaway |first1=C.

Kirk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings point to a bigger issue as many people in the world may be over-reporting church attendance because of their self-perception and identity as churchgoing people, indicating a certain psychological aspect to the over-reporting of church attendance. Although surveys of church attendance are aimed to study religious behavior, many respondents view them as questions about their identity. This is especially true among Americans who consider themselves "regular churchgoers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html The Church Attendance Gap: A look at two older studies whose findings should be taken more seriously] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130031340/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html |date=2013-11-30 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22319">'''Cognitive semantics''' is part of the [[cognitive linguistics]] movement. [[Semantics]] is the study of linguistic meaning. Cognitive semantics holds that language is part of a more general human [[Cognition|cognitive ability]], and can therefore only describe the world as people conceive of it.&lt;ref name=Croft&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author=Croft, William and D. Alan Cruse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|pages=1,105,7–15,33–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I6Z9H-eRSgoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit that different linguistic communities conceive of simple things and processes in the world differently (different cultures), not necessarily some difference between a person's conceptual world and the real world (wrong beliefs).

The main tenets of cognitive semantics are:
* That grammar manifests a conception of the world held in a culture;
* That knowledge of language is acquired and contextual;
* That the ability to use language draws upon general cognitive resources and not a special [[language module]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

As part of the field of cognitive linguistics, the cognitive semantics approach rejects the traditional separation of [[linguistics]] into [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], etc. Instead, it divides semantics into ''meaning-construction'' and ''knowledge representation''. Therefore, cognitive semantics studies much of the area traditionally devoted to [[pragmatics]] as well as [[semantics]]. 

The techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in [[lexicology|lexical]] studies such as those put forth by [[Leonard Talmy]], [[George Lakoff]], [[Dirk Geeraerts]], and [[Bruce Wayne Hawkins]]. Some cognitive semantic frameworks, such as that developed by Talmy, take into account syntactic structures as well.

== Points of contrast ==

As a field, semantics is interested in three big questions: what does it mean for units of language, called [[lexeme]]s, to have "meaning"? What does it mean for sentences to have meaning? Finally, how is it that meaningful units fit together to compose complete sentences? These are the main points of inquiry behind studies into [[lexical semantics]], [[structural semantics]], and theories of [[compositionality]] (respectively). In each category, traditional theories seem to be at odds with those accounts provided by cognitive semanticists.

Classic theories in semantics (in the tradition of [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]) have tended to explain the meaning of parts in terms of ''necessary and sufficient conditions'', sentences in terms of ''truth-conditions'', and composition in terms of ''[[propositional function]]s''. Each of these positions is tightly related to the others. According to these traditional theories, the meaning of a particular sentence may be understood as the conditions under which the proposition conveyed by the sentence hold true. For instance, the expression "snow is white" is true if and only if snow is, in fact, white. Lexical units can be understood as holding meaning either by virtue of [[Extension (semantics)|set of things]] they may apply to (called the "extension" of the word), or in terms of the [[Intension|common properties]] that hold between these things (called its "intension"). The intension provides an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] with the necessary and sufficient conditions that let a thing qualify as a member of some lexical unit's extension. Roughly, propositional functions are those abstract instructions that guide the interpreter in taking the free variables in an [[open sentence]] and filling them in, resulting in a correct understanding of the sentence as a whole.

Meanwhile, cognitive semantic theories are typically built on the argument that lexical meaning is conceptual. That is, meaning is not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding. As a result, semantic facts like "All bachelors are unmarried males" are not treated as special facts about our language practices; rather, these facts are not distinct from encyclopaedic knowledge. In treating linguistic knowledge as being a piece with everyday knowledge, the question is raised: how can cognitive semantics explain paradigmatically semantic phenomena, like category structure? Set to the challenge, researchers have drawn upon theories from related fields, like [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive anthropology]]. One proposal is to treat in order to explain category structure in terms of ''nodes'' in a ''knowledge network''. One example of a theory from cognitive science that has made its way into the cognitive semantic mainstream is the theory of [[prototype theory|prototypes]], which cognitive semanticists generally argue is the cause of [[polysemy]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is unduly limited in its account of full sentence meaning. While they are not on the whole hostile to truth-conditional semantics, they point out that it has limited explanatory power. That is to say, it is limited to indicative sentences, and does not seem to offer any straightforward or intuitive way of treating (say) commands or expressions. By contrast, cognitive semantics seeks to capture the full range of [[grammatical mood]]s by also making use of the notions of framing and mental spaces.

Another trait of cognitive semantics is the recognition that meaning is not fixed but a matter of [[construal]] and conventionalization. The processes of linguistic construal, it is argued, are the same psychological processes involved in the processing of encyclopaedic knowledge and in perception. This view has implications for the problem of compositionality. An account in cognitive semantics called the [[dynamic construal theory]] makes the claim that words themselves are without meaning: they have, at best, "default construals," which are really just ways of using words. Along these lines, cognitive semantics argues that compositionality can only be intelligible if pragmatic elements like context and intention are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

== The structure of concepts ==

Cognitive semantics has sought to challenge traditional theories in two ways: first, by providing an account of the meaning of sentences by going beyond truth-conditional accounts; and second, by attempting to go beyond accounts of word meaning that appeal to necessary and sufficient conditions. It accomplishes both by examining the structure of concepts.

===Frame semantics===
{{Main|Frame semantics (linguistics)}}
Frame semantics, developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]], attempts to explain meaning in terms of their relation to general ''understanding'', not just in the terms laid out by truth-conditional semantics. Fillmore explains meaning in general (including the meaning of lexemes) in terms of ''"frames"''. By "frame" is meant any concept that can only be understood if a larger system of concepts is also understood.

==== Fillmore: framing ====

Many pieces of linguistic evidence motivate the frame-semantic project. First, it has been noted that word meaning is an extension of our bodily and cultural experiences. For example, the notion of ''restaurant'' is associated with a series of concepts, like ''food, service, waiters, tables, and eating''.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; These rich-but-contingent associations cannot be captured by an analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, yet they still seem to be intimately related to our understanding of "restaurant".

Second, and more seriously, these conditions are not enough to account for asymmetries in the ways that words are used. According to a semantic feature analysis, there is nothing more to the meanings of "boy" and "girl" than:

# BOY [+MALE], [+YOUNG]
# GIRL [+FEMALE], [+YOUNG]

And there is surely some truth to this proposal. Indeed, cognitive semanticists understand the instances of the concept held by a given certain word may be said to exist in a ''schematic relation'' with the concept itself. And this is regarded as a legitimate approach to semantic analysis, so far as it goes.

However, linguists have found that language users regularly apply the terms "boy" and "girl" in ways that go beyond mere semantic features. That is, for instance, people tend to be more likely to consider a young female a "girl" (as opposed to "woman"), than they are to consider a borderline-young male a "boy" (as opposed to "man").&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; This fact suggests that there is a latent frame, made up of cultural attitudes, expectations, and background assumptions, which is part of word meaning. These background assumptions go up and beyond those necessary and sufficient conditions that correspond to a semantic feature account. Frame semantics, then, seeks to account for these puzzling features of lexical items in some systematic way.

Third, cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is incapable of dealing adequately with some aspects of the meanings at the level of the sentence. Take the following:

# You didn't spare me a day at the seaside; you deprived me of one.

In this case, the truth-conditions of the claim expressed by the antecedent in the sentence are not being denied by the proposition expressed after the clause. Instead, what is being denied is the way that the antecedent is framed.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

Finally, with the frame-semantic paradigm's analytical tools, the linguist is able to explain a wider range of semantic phenomena than they would be able to with only necessary and sufficient conditions. Some words have the same definitions or intensions, and the same extensions, but have subtly different domains. For example, the lexemes ''land'' and ''ground'' are synonyms, yet they naturally contrast with different things -- ''sea'' and ''air'', respectively.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; 

As we have seen, the frame semantic account is by no means limited to the study of lexemes—with it, researchers may examine expressions at more complex levels, including the level of the sentence (or, more precisely, the utterance). The notion of framing is regarded as being of the same cast as the pragmatic notion of ''background assumptions''. Philosopher of language [[John Searle]] explains the latter by asking readers to consider sentences like "The cat is on the mat". For such a sentence to make any sense, the interpreter makes a series of assumptions: i.e., that there is gravity, the cat is parallel to the mat, and the two touch. For the sentence to be intelligible, the speaker supposes that the interpreter has an idealized or default frame in mind.

==== Langacker: profile and base ====

An alternate strain of Fillmore's analysis can be found in the work of [[Ronald Langacker]], who makes a distinction between the notions of ''profile'' and ''base''. The profile is the concept symbolized by the word itself, while the base is the encyclopedic knowledge that the concept presupposes. For example, let the definition of "radius" be "a line segment that joins the center of a circle with any point on its circumference". If all we know of the concept ''radius'' is its profile, then we simply know that it is a line segment that is attached to something called the "circumference" in some greater whole called the "circle". That is to say, our understanding is fragmentary until the base concept of ''circle'' is firmly grasped.

When a single base supports a number of different profiles, then it can be called a "''domain''". For instance, the concept profiles of ''arc, center, and circumference'' are all in the domain of ''circle'', because each uses the concept of ''circle'' as a base. We are then in a position to characterize the notion of a frame as being either the base of the concept profile, or (more generally) the domain that the profile is a part of.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

=== Categorization and cognition ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}

[[File:Prototype membership.gif|left|thumb|Membership of a graded class]]

A major divide in the approaches to cognitive semantics lies in the puzzle surrounding the nature of category structure. As mentioned in the previous section, semantic feature analyses fall short of accounting for the frames that categories may have. An alternative proposal would have to go beyond the minimalistic models given by classical accounts, and explain the richness of detail in meaning that language speakers attribute to categories.

''Prototype theories'', investigated by [[Eleanor Rosch]], have given some reason to suppose that many natural lexical category structures are graded, i.e., they have prototypical members that are considered to be "better fit" the category than other examples. For instance, [[American robin|robins]] are generally viewed as better examples of the category "[[bird]]" than, say, [[penguin]]s. If this view of category structure is the case, then categories can be understood to have central and peripheral members, and not just be evaluated in terms of members and non-members.

In a related vein, [[George Lakoff]], following the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], noted that some categories are only connected to one another by way of ''family resemblances''. While some classical categories may exist, i.e., which are structured by necessary and sufficient conditions, there are at least two other kinds: ''generative'' and ''radial''. 

''Generative categories'' can be formed by taking central cases and applying certain principles to designate category membership. The principle of similarity is one example of a rule that might generate a broader category from given prototypes.

''Radial categories'' are categories motivated by conventions, but not predictable from rules. The concept of "mother", for example, may be explained in terms of a variety of conditions that may or may not be sufficient. Those conditions may include: being married, has always been female, gave birth to the child, supplied half the child's genes, is a caregiver, is married to the genetic father, is one generation older than the child, and is the legal guardian.&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|author=Lakoff, George|pages=82–83, 70|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any one of the above conditions might not be met: for instance, a "single mother" does not need to be married, and a "surrogate mother" does not necessarily provide nurturance. When these aspects collectively cluster together, they form a prototypical case of what it means to be a mother, but nevertheless they fail to outline the category crisply. Variations upon the central meaning are established by convention by the community of language users.

For Lakoff, prototype effects can be explained in large part due to the effects of [[idealized cognitive model]]s. That is, domains are organized with an ideal notion of the world that may or may not fit reality. For example, the word "bachelor" is commonly defined as "unmarried adult male". However, this concept has been created with a particular ideal of what a bachelor is like: an adult, uncelibate, independent, socialized, and promiscuous. Reality might either strain the expectations of the concept, or create false positives. That is, people typically want to widen the meaning of "bachelor" to include exceptions like "a sexually active seventeen-year-old who lives alone and owns his own firm" (not technically an adult but seemingly still a bachelor), and this can be considered a kind of straining of the definition. Moreover, speakers would tend to want to exclude from the concept of ''bachelor'' certain false positives, such as those adult unmarried males that don't bear much resemblance to the ideal: i.e., the Pope, or Tarzan.&lt;ref name=Lakoff /&gt; Prototype effects may also be explained as a function of either [[basic-level categorization]] and typicality, closeness to an ideal, or stereotyping.

So viewed, prototype theory seems to give an account of category structure. However, there are a number of criticisms of this interpretation of the data. Indeed, Rosch and Lakoff, themselves chief advocates of prototype theory, have emphasized in their later works that the findings of prototype theory do not necessarily tell us anything about category structure. Some theorists in the cognitive semantics tradition have challenged both classical and prototype accounts of category structure by proposing the dynamic construal account, where category structure is always created "on-line"—and so, that categories have no structure outside of the context of use.

=== Mental spaces===
{{Main|Mental space}}
[[File:Prop-attitudes-example.gif|thumb|250px|right|Propositional attitudes in Fodor's presentation of truth-conditional semantics]]

In traditional semantics, the meaning of a sentence is the situation it represents, and the situation can be described in terms of the possible world that it would be true of. Moreover, sentence meanings may be dependent upon [[propositional attitude]]s: those features that are relative to someone's beliefs, desires, and mental states. The role of propositional attitudes in truth-conditional semantics is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|author=Bunnin, Nicholas and E. P. Tsui-James|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by at least one line of argument, truth-conditional semantics seems to be able to capture the meaning of belief-sentences like "Frank believes that the [[Red Sox]] will win the next game" by appealing to propositional attitudes. The meaning of the overall proposition is described as a set of abstract conditions, wherein Frank holds a certain propositional attitude, and the attitude is itself a relationship between Frank and a particular proposition; and this proposition is the possible world where the Red Sox win the next game.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;{{cite book|title=Propositional Attitudes|author=Fodor, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, many theorists have grown dissatisfied with the inelegance and dubious ontology behind possible-worlds semantics. An alternative can be found in the work of [[Gilles Fauconnier]]. For Fauconnier, the meaning of a sentence can be derived from "mental spaces". Mental spaces are cognitive structures entirely in the minds of interlocutors. In his account, there are two kinds of mental space. The ''base space'' is used to describe reality (as it is understood by both interlocutors). ''Space builders'' (or ''built space'') are those mental spaces that go beyond reality by addressing possible worlds, along with temporal expressions, fictional constructs, games, and so on.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Additionally, Fauconnier semantics distinguishes between ''roles'' and ''values''. A semantic role is understood to be description of a category, while values are the instances that make up the category. (In this sense, the role-value distinction is a special case of the [[type-token distinction]].) 

Fauconnier argues that curious semantic constructions can be explained handily by the above apparatus. Take the following sentence:

# In 1929, the lady with white hair was blonde.

The semanticist must construct an explanation for the obvious fact that the above sentence is not contradictory. Fauconnier constructs his analysis by observing that there are two mental spaces (the present-space and the 1929-space). His ''access principle'' supposes that "a value in one space can be described by the role its counterpart in another space has, even if that role is invalid for the value in the first space".&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; So, to use the example above, the value in 1929-space is ''the blonde'', while she is being described with the role of ''the lady with white hair'' in present-day space.

== Conceptualization and construal ==
{{Main|Construal}}

As we have seen, cognitive semantics gives a treatment of issues in the construction of meaning both at the level of the sentence and the level of the lexeme in terms of the structure of concepts. However, it is not entirely clear what cognitive processes are at work in these accounts. Moreover, it is not clear how we might go about explaining the ways that concepts are actively employed in conversation. It appears to be the case that, if our project is to look at ''how'' linguistic strings convey different semantic content, we must first catalogue ''what'' cognitive processes are being used to do it. Researchers can satisfy both requirements by attending to the ''construal operations'' involved in language processing—that is to say, by investigating the ways that people ''structure their experiences'' through language.

Language is full of conventions that allow for subtle and nuanced conveyances of experience. To use an example that is readily at hand, framing is all-pervasive, and it may extend across the full breadth of linguistic data, extending from the most complex utterances, to tone, to word choice, to expressions derived from the composition of [[morpheme]]s. Another example is ''[[Image schema|image-schemata]]'', which are ways that we structure and understand the elements of our experience driven by any given sense.

According to linguists [[William Croft (linguist)|William Croft]] and [[D. Alan Cruse]], there are four broad cognitive abilities that play an active part in the construction of construals. They are: attention/[[salience (language)|salience]], [[judgment]]/comparison, [[situatedness]], and constitution/[[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Each general category contains a number of subprocesses, each of which helps to explain the ways we encode experience into language in some unique way.

Hunley'', Dec. 6, 1863]] [[File:PSM V58 D167 Confederate submarine which sank the housatonic.png|thumb|PSM V58 D167 Confederate submarine which sank the ''Housatonic'']]

The '''conservation-restoration of the ''[[H.L. Hunley]]''''' is currently being undertaken by the [[Warren Lasch Conservation Center]]; they hope to have the ''Hunley'' project completed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L. Hunley|url=http://thetandd.com/news/a-fresh-look-at-the-h-l-hunley/article_0e9e261e-8736-11e6-a3aa-3fdd6b2bc384.html|website=T&amp;D|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Hunley'' was located in 1995 and recovered from the ocean in 2000, a team of conservators from the Lasch Conservation Center has been working to restore the ''Hunley''. 

The ''Hunley'', the first combat submarine to successfully complete its mission, has been at the Lasch Conservation Center for over 15 years while scientist and conservators formulate a plan for its restoration. Once the ''Hunley''{{’}}s conservation and restoration is complete it will be relocated to a new museum built in its honor on the former Navy base in North Charleston. Currently visitors can tour the conservation center laboratories and can view the ''Hunley'' in its 75,000-gallon tank.

==History and sinking of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
{{main article|Sinking of USS Housatonic}}
''H.L. Hunley'' is a civil war confederate submarine built in 1863 by Park &amp; Lyons; Hunley, McClintock &amp; Weston. Its length is 39.5 ft. and its beam is 3.83 ft. and it had a speed of four [[Knot (unit)|knots]]. It was propelled by a hand cranked propeller and held a crew of one officer and seven enlisted men. Its armament carried one spar torpedo. The ''Hunley'' sank three times during its short career. The first two times were during test runs, and the final time was during its attack of the {{USS|Housatonic|1861}}. The ''Hunley'' was lost to the Charleston outer harbor until 1995 and was finally recovered in 2000.

On February 17, 1864, the ''Hunley'' destroyed the Union sloop ''Housatonic'' outside the Charleston Harbor. The ''Hunley'' was too close to the ''Housatonic'' when they exploded the torpedo. The Hunley was mounted with a “spar-mounted torpedo loaded with 135 pounds of gunpowder”. After the ''Hunley'' had rammed the ''Housatonic'' and embedded the torpedo in her hull, the ''Hunley'' reversed course while the lanyard connected to the torpedo fuse was tightened and exploded. The ''Housatonic'' sank immediately; however, the ''Hunley'' did not sink so quickly. Evidence shows that the ''Hunley'' may have survived up to an hour after the detonation of the torpedo on the ''Housatonic''.

==Discovery and recovery of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Location of the Hunley.png|thumb|Location of the ''Hunley'' submarine]]
The ''H.L. Hunley'' was found in 1995 in the Charleston outer harbor about four miles off Sullivan’s island. The divers had to dive down 30 feet of water before finding the ''Hunley'', which was buried in the sand and sediment. There is some controversy about who located the actual position of the ''Hunley''. Well-known author [[Clive Cussler]] and underwater archaeologist [[E. Lee Spence]] both claim to have made the original discovery. Cussler claims to have discovered it in 1995, and Spence says he discovered it in 1970 but failed to validate the discovery by diving in the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Confederate Submarine H.L. Hunley|url=http://shipwrecks.com/hunley_discovery/|website=Shipwrecks|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSSHLHunleyrecovery.jpg|thumb|''H.L. Hunley'' recovery]]
The ''Hunley'' was sent to Lasch Conservation Center at the old Charleston Navy Yard for conservation. The remains of the eight crewmen serving on the ''Hunley'' when it sank were found and buried on April 17, 2004, at the [[Magnolia Cemetery (Charleston, South Carolina)|Magnolia Cemetery]] in Charleston. The recovery and conservation of the ''H.L. Hunley'' was championed by South Carolina Senator [[Glenn F. McConnell|Glenn McConnell]]. He asked Warren Lasch to take on the fundraising and oversee the conservation and restoration treatment of the ''Hunley''. Lasch accepted the challenge in 1997 and became the chairman of the Friends of the Hunley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search and Recovery|url=https://hunley.org/the-search-and-recovery/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of deterioration present on the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Rust on iron.jpg|thumb|Rust on iron]]

===Rust===
[[Rust]] occurs naturally when iron or steel is submerged in water and exposed to oxygen. It can also occur when the moisture content of the air surrounding the metal is high. Because the ''H.L. Hunley'' was made of iron and was submerged for over a hundred years, rust had formed all over the submarine. However, to prevent more rust from forming, the conservators choose to keep the ''H.L. Hunley'' submerged in a water tank, instead of exposing it to the oxygen-rich air, until a full conservation plan could be created.

===Metal Fatigue===
[[Fatigue (material)|Metal Fatigue (Stress and Corrosion)]] can be either from stress or corrosion. Stress fatigue occurs when the metal is repeatedly pushed back and forth, such as from water pressure. This pressure eventually cause tiny cracks to form in the metal. Corrosion fatigue happens when the cracks in the metal becomes corrosive and weaken the structure. Thus normal wear and tear can cause metal fatigue.

===Causes of deterioration===

[[File:Hunley 001.jpg|thumb|''Hunley'']]

====Salt Water====
The combination of salt water and metal can cause several types of [[corrosion]], electrochemical corrosion and anaerobic corrosion. Electrochemical corrosion happens because the metal ions attract other compounds, which then cause the salt in the water to attack the metal. Anaerobic corrosion occurs when sulfate deposits surround the submerged metal and start producing hydrogen sulfide, which corrodes metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Bailey|title=The Effects of Saltwater on Metals|url=http://sciencing.com/effects-saltwater-metals-8632636.html|website=Sciencing|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''H.L. Hunley'' sank in the outer harbor of Charleston, the salt water had over a hundred years to eat through the metal.

====Air/oxygen====
Iron artifacts from the sea in particular are susceptible to rapid deterioration when exposed to an oxygen-rich environment like air. Chlorides from the seawater penetrate the iron on the molecular level. When in solution, these chlorides present no real problem. However, when exposed to air, they slowly dry in crystal form. As the crystals grow, the surface of the metal will expand and flake away, eventually reducing the artifact to a pile of iron oxide dust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation|url=https://hunley.org/conservation/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the iron oxide dust is called rust. Rust occurs naturally on iron when it has been submerged for a while and is exposed to oxygen.

====Concretion====
Concretion is an encrusted layer of sand, sediment and shells that builds up slowly, when an object is submerged in water. Over time, marine organisms colonize on the submerged metal and build up layers of calcium. These layers create a barrier for a micro environment on the surface of the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron corrosion &amp; Concretion formation|url=http://www.clihouston.com/news/iron-corrosion-concretion-formation.html|website=CLI Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments of deterioration==
===Timeline of conservation and restoration===
* August 2000: ''Hunley'' raised from the sea
* February 2001: Several hull plates are removed
* March 2001: First artifacts are found
* April 2001: First human remains are uncovered
* September 2001: Second Phase of conservation and restoration begins
* January 2002: Third Phase begins, studies on the human remains and excavation of the block lifts
* 2003: Fourth Phase begins, excavation of the ballast tanks
* 2008: 3-D scanning of the exterior surface
* June 2011:  ''Hunley'' is rotated to an upright position
* May 2014: ''Hunley'' is lowered into the 75,000 gallon tank, designed to remove the salt from the metal
* 2014-2015: Removal of the outer concretion
* 2016: Removal of the interior concretion

===Rotation===
The ''Hunley'' was removed from its watery grave at a 45-degree angle in order to keep the interior contents from shifting and falling through a weaken section of the hull. The ''Hunley'' had been lying at 45-degree angle on the sea floor for more than a hundred years. To lift the civil war submarine from the ocean, several slings were attached to the underside of the submarine and then slowly lifted from the water. 

Once the submarine was relocated to the Lasch Conservation Center, it was left in the slings at a 45-degree angle until the hull plates and keel blocks were removed, eleven tons of sediment had been cleaned out of the interior and a engineering and strength evaluation could be completed. Once the evaluation was completed and the ''Hunley'' was deemed safe to move, it took three days in June of 2011 to turn the civil war submarine upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Brian|title=Righting the Hunley: Sub's move begins Wednesday, with rotation next week|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/righting-the-hunley-sub-s-move-begins-wednesday-with-rotation/article_ba49de16-4a52-589c-8d31-55cfcb2d1037.html|website=The Post and Courier|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservators also used sensors, located on the keel support, to monitor the weight on each bearing. This was done so that the conservators can make sure the weight of the submarine is being supported evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley hull being revealed after almost 150 years|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700145372/Confederate-submarine-HL-Hunley-hull-being-revealed-after-almost-150-years.html|website=Associated Press|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concretion removal===
When the ''Hunley'' was brought to the Lasch Conservation Center, it had over 1,200 pounds of concretion on its outer hull, that is equal to the weight of a large grizzly bear. In some places on the hull the concretion was over an inch thick. To remove the concretion, conservators spent many hours slowly chiseling the concretion off, using pneumatic chisels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L. Hunley|url=http://thetandd.com/news/a-fresh-look-at-the-h-l-hunley/article_0e9e261e-8736-11e6-a3aa-3fdd6b2bc384.html|website=T&amp;D|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took conservators over a year to remove all the concretion from the outer hull. Currently the conservators have finished removing the concretion from the outside and are working on the interior. It will take at least another year to remove the interior concretion, perhaps a little longer since the conservators have to work in the small interior space of the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hull of Confederate sub H.L.

===Submersion===
After the ''Hunley'' was recovered  it was placed in a 75,000-gallon tank. This was in order to protect the ''Hunley'' from the deterioration properties of oxygen. If it was left out in the open air, it would immediately begin to rust and deteriorate rapidly. By placing the ''Hunley'' in the tank, consisting of water and a solution of [[sodium hydroxide]], conservators had bought some time to formulate a conservation plan. "During treatment, the ''Hunley'' will be constantly monitored and once the chemical bath is saturated with the salts it has leached from the submarine, it will be drained from the tank, neutralized, and replaced with a fresh solution.  This process, which is estimated to take approximately 5-7 years, will be repeated until the level of salt in the iron is low enough to allow the ''Hunley'' to be rescued from its delicate and dangerous state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conservation |date=n.d. |access-date=March 20, 2017 |url=https://hunley.org/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">'''Conversational interfaces''' (CUI) are platforms that mimic a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the user pressing a “back” button to translate the user’s desired action into commands the computer understands. While an effective mechanism of completing computing actions, there is a learning curve for the user associated with GUI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conversational Interfaces: Where Are We Today? Where Are We Heading? | website=Smashing Magazine | url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/conversational-interfaces-where-are-we-today-where-are-we-heading/ | ref={{sfnref | Smashing Magazine}} | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, CUI’s provide opportunity for the user to communicate with the computer in their natural language rather than in a syntax specific commands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brownlee | first=John | title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained | website=Co.Design | date=2016-04-04 | url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To do this, conversational interfaces use [[Natural_language_processing|Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) to allow computers to understand, analyze and create meaning from human language. Unlike word processors, NLP considers the structure to human language (i.e. Words make a phrase, phrases make sentences which convey the idea or intent the user is trying to invoke). The ambiguous nature of human language makes it difficult for a machine to always correctly interpret the user’s requests, which is why we have seen a shift towards [[Natural_language_understanding|Natural Language Understanding]] (NLU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pan | first=Jiaqi | title=Conversational Interfaces: The Future of Chatbots – Chatbots Magazine | website=Chatbots Magazine | date=2017-08-25 | url=https://chatbotsmagazine.com/conversational-interfaces-the-future-of-chatbots-18975a91fe5a | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

NLU allows for [[sentiment analysis]] and conversational searches which allows a line of questioning to continue, with the context carried throughout the conversation. NLU allows conversational interfaces to handle unstructured inputs that the human brain is able to understand such as spelling mistakes of follow-up questions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lola | title=NLP vs. NLU: What’s the Difference? – Lola – Medium | website=Medium | date=2016-10-05 | url=https://medium.com/@lolatravel/nlp-vs-nlu-whats-the-difference-d91c06780992 | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   For example, through leveraging NLU, a user could first ask for the population of the United States. If the user then asks “Who is the president”, the search will carry forward the context of the United States and provide the appropriate response.

Conversational interfaces have emerged as a tool for businesses to efficiently provide consumers with relevant information, in a cost effective manner. CUI provide ease of access to relevant, contextual information to the end user without the complexities and learning curve typically associated with technology.

While there are a variety of interface brands, to date, there are two main categories of conversational interfaces; [[Voice_command_device|voice assistants]] and [[Chatbot|chatbots]].

==Voice Assistants==

[[Voice assistant]]s are interfaces that allow a user to complete an action simply by speaking a command. Introduced in October 2011, Apple’s [[Siri]] was one of the first voice assistants widely adopted. Siri allowed users of iPhone to get information and complete actions on their device simply by asking Siri.
 
Further development has continued since Siri’s introduction to include home based devices such as [[Google_Home|Google Home]] or [[Amazon_Echo|Amazon Echo]] (powered by Alexa) that allow users to “connect” their homes through a series of smart devices to further the options of tangible actions they can complete. Users can now turn off the lights, set reminders and call their friends all with a verbal queue. 

These conversational interfaces that utilize a voice assistant have become an efficient and popular way for businesses to interact with their customers as the interface removes the typical friction in a customer journey. Customers no longer need to remember a long list of usernames and passwords to their various accounts; they simply link each account to Google or Amazon once, and gone are the days where you needed to wait on hold for an hour to ask a simple question. 

==Chatbots==

[[Chatbot]]s are web or mobile based interfaces that allow the user to ask questions and retrieve information. This information can be generic in nature such as the Google Assistant chat window that allows for internet searches, or it can be a specific brand or service which allows the user to gain information about the status of their various accounts. Their backend systems work in the same manner as a voice assistant, with the front end utilizing a visual interface to convey information. This visual interface can be beneficial for companies that need to do more complex business transactions with customers, as instructions, deep links and graphics can all be utilized to convey an answer. The complexity to which a chatbot answers questions depends on the development of the back end. Chatbots with hard-coded answers has a smaller base on information and corresponding skills. Chatbots that leverage machine learning will continue to grow and develop larger content bases for more complex responses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Onlim | title=How do Chatbots Work? – Chatbots Life | website=Chatbots Life | date=2017-03-22 | url=https://chatbotslife.com/how-do-chatbots-work-fe49ef32598f | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

More frequently, companies are leveraging chatbots as a way to offload simple questions and transactions from human agents. These chatbots provide the option to assist a user, but then directly transfer the customer to a live agent within the same chat window if the conversation becomes too complex.

[[Image:Cells detention centers 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cells without (left) and with (right) Detention Centers]]
A '''nucleolar detention center (DC)''' is a region of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] in which certain [[protein]]s are [[Nucleolus#Sequestration of proteins|temporarily detained]] in periods of [[Cellular stress response|cellular stress]].&lt;ref name="jacobmboc"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacob MD, Audas TE, Uniacke J, Trinkle-Mulcahy L, Lee S |title=Environmental cues induce a long noncoding RNA-dependent remodeling of the nucleolus |journal=Mol Biol Cell |volume=24|issue=18 |pages=2943–53 |year=2013|pmid=23904269 |doi=10.1091/mbc.E13-04-0223 |pmc=3771955}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCs are absent from cells under normal culture conditions, but form in response to specific environmental triggers, such as [[Acidosis|low extracellular pH]] or [[heat shock|high temperature]], when [[long noncoding RNA]]s are induced from regions of [[Intergenic region|intergenic DNA]].&lt;ref name="jacobmboc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="audasmc"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Audas TE, Jacob MD, Lee S |title=Immobilization of proteins in the nucleolus by ribosomal intergenic spacer noncoding RNA |journal=Mol Cell |volume=45|issue=2 |pages=145–57 |year=2012|pmid=    22284675 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prasanth KV |title=Policing cells under stress: noncoding RNAs capture proteins in nucleolar detention centers |journal=Mol Cell |volume=45|issue=2 |pages=141–2 |year=2012|pmid=22284672 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2012.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention of numerous proteins in DCs is believed to reduce metabolic activity and promote survival under unfavorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Audas TE, Jacob MD, Lee S |title=The nucleolar detention pathway: a cellular strategy for regulating molecular networks |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=11|issue=11 |pages=2059–62 |year=2012|pmid=22580471 |doi=10.4161/cc.20140| pmc=3368857}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DCs form at the center of [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and therefore disrupt the normal organization of these organelles. The structural remodeling that ensues leaves [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] unable to sustain their primary function, [[Nucleolus#Function and ribosome assembly|ribosomal biogenesis]]. Therefore, the formation of DCs is thought to convert nucleoli from “ribosome factories” to “prisons for proteins”.&lt;ref name="jacobmboc" /&gt;

The '''Doctor of Commerce''' ('''DCom''')&lt;ref&gt;General information can be accessed via, for example, the [[South African Qualifications Authority|SAQA]] [http://regqs.saqa.org.za/search.php?cat=qual qualifications page] or the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]] [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ qualifications page] searching for "doctor of commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[doctoral degree]] in [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[economics]]-, and [[management]]-related subjects, awarded by universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The degree is offered both as a [[higher doctorate]], and as a [[research doctorate]].

The higher doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the universities of [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/regulations/award/dcom_regs.shtml Canterbury], [http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/dcom.html Otago], [http://clm.ukzn.ac.za/Libraries/Information_for_students/CLM_sflb.sflb.ashx Kwazulu-Natal], [http://courses.handbooks.uwa.edu.au/courses/c4/40910 Western Australia] and [http://www.wits.ac.za/files/gr264_189955001326275256.pdf Witwatersrand]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
is awarded for published work of the candidate, demonstrating original contributions of "special excellence" in some branch of commerce. The candidate will be a graduate of the university in question.

The research doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }} and  [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26739 UNISA].&lt;/ref&gt; is largely comparable to a [[PhD]] and in fact "Doctor of Commerce" may refer to a commerce-related [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vms/study/postgraduate/phd.aspx Victoria University of Wellington] and [http://www.nmmu.ac.za/default.asp?id=4882&amp;aq=B%2B&amp;fc=1400&amp;bhcp=1 Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, at some universities the degree-title conferred will be a function of the candidate’s background: for example, in [[operations research]], the degree may be a PhD or a DCom, depending on whether the candidate held a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Commerce]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=24967 UNISA], and the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in some cases, the degree title may also depend on the area of the research: a thesis focused on a more theoretical area (e.g. [[financial economics|"finance"]]) will be awarded a PhD, while one focused on a specific area or function (e.g. [[Managerial finance|financial management]]) will be awarded a DCom.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx University of Johannesburg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106065404/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx |date=January 6, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in some cases the distinction will be whether the degree includes coursework or is entirely thesis based.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 University of Pretoria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227140522/http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 |date=December 27, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research doctorate is usually accessed following a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|related master's degree]], often the [[Master of Commerce]].  Here, there is generally a requirement that the [[master’s degree]] in question must include a research component, either comprising [[coursework]] with research, or being solely [[thesis]]-based.

'''Doll fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetish]] in which an individual is attracted to [[doll]]s and doll like objects such as [[figurine]]s. The attraction may include the desire for actual sexual contact with a doll, a fantasy of a sexual encounter with an animate or inanimate doll, encounters between dolls themselves, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into a doll.

[[Roleplay]]
When the couple/significant enjoy being dressed up as a "doll", usually big lolita/victorian outifts/ or lingery undergarments in sexual ways. Can also include bondage like a marrionete or nicknames such as "Baby doll", "Doll", "little marrionete", and other names associated with the doll type style. This fetish is usually very pretty and pampered type [and very kinky at times].

==As a fantasy==

Though not common it can involve intercourse or other sexual activity with dolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">'''Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough''' (1893–1965) was a [[scholar]] in the [[history of religion]]. He is specifically noted for his study of the influence of [[Greek culture]] on [[Judaism]], what some call [[Hellenistic Judaism]].

Born in [[Brooklyn]], he studied at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], [[Drew Theological Seminary]], and then received a bachelor's degree in [[theology]] from [[Garrett Biblical Institute]] in 1917.  He went on to [[Harvard University]] for three years, then three more years at [[Oxford University]], where he received the [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] degree in 1923.

He then began teaching at [[Yale University]] in 1923, where he taught until he retired in 1962. He went on [[Brandeis University]], then was given an office in the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard. He received honorary degrees from Yale, [[Hebrew Union College]], and the [[University of Uppsala]].

He edited the ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature]]'' from 1934-1942.

His papers are archived at Yale.  After his death, he was honored by a volume of studies in his honor, ''Religions in Antiquity: Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough'', edited by [[Jacob Neusner]], published by E.J. Brill in 1968 (reprinted by Wipf and Stock in 2004).

'''Growth management''', in the United States, is a set of techniques used by the government to ensure that as the population grows that there are services available to meet their demands.  These are not necessarily only government services.  Other demands such as the protection of natural spaces, sufficient and affordable housing, delivery of utilities, preservation of buildings and places of historical value, and sufficient places for the conduct of business are also considered.

One technique is the imposition of [[impact fee]]s.  Impact fees are imposed to charge the owners of newly developed properties for the "impact" the new development will have on the community.  Fees can be used for such things as transportation improvements, new parks, and expansion of schools.  Impact fees are not used to maintain existing facilities, but instead, are used to create new facilities in proportion to the number of new developments in the area.

Another technique is the application of [[zoning]] to reduce the cost of service delivery.  Zoning can be used to reduce the area affected by urbanization, allowing the same number of people to live and work in a smaller area, allowing governmental services to be delivered more efficiently.  For example, fire protection and emergency medical response services are less expensive to provide in compact areas than in areas where the population is more spread out.  This results in lower expenditures for the same [[level of service]], which saves taxpayer dollars.  The efficiencies gained can also result in benefits to the private sector.  For example, grocery stores and [[pizza delivery]] businesses can serve only a limited area.  If more customers are located within their service delivery area, the cost of delivering their services is decreased.

Preventing suburban densities from affecting a large area also has the effect of providing open spaces so that people who wish to live in a rural setting can do so without [[urbanization]] threatening their lifestyle.

The application of growth management techniques is often governed by the development of a [[comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]].  The plan can be used to measure the impact that new growth will have on the community and define the method by which that impact is mitigated.

Pioneers in United States growth management were Oregon, which established [[Urban Growth Boundary|Urban Growth Boundaries]] in the 1970s and Florida which passed the Growth Management Act in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608160141/http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |archive-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''halo''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἅλως}}, ''halōs'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|halo}} {{LSJ|a(/lws|ἅλως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''nimbus''', '''[[Aureola|aureole]]''', '''glory''', or '''gloriole''') is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/halo-art|title=halo – art|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that surrounds a person in art.  They have been used in the [[iconography]] of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes.  In the sacred art of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or flames in [[Asian art]], around the head or around the whole body—this last one is often called a [[mandorla]].  Halos may be shown as almost any color or combination of colors, but are most often depicted as golden, yellow or white when representing light or red when representing flames.

Further afield, [[Sumer]]ian religious literature frequently speaks of ''melam'' (loaned into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''melammu''), a "brilliant, visible glamour which is exuded by gods, heroes, sometimes by kings, and also by temples of great holiness and by gods' symbols and emblems."&lt;ref&gt;J.

The halo and the [[aureola]] have been widely used in Indian art, particularly in [[Buddhist]] iconography&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/asia/divided/d1_Art_S_Asia.pdf|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Art of South Asia|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the Kushan [[Bimaran casket]] in the [[British Museum]] is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD).  The rulers of the [[Kushan Empire]] were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt;

In Chinese and Japanese [[Buddhist art]] the halo has also been used since the earliest periods in depicting the image of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and others. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses haloes and aureoles of many types, drawing from both Indian and Chinese traditions, extensively in statues and [[Thangka]] paintings of Buddhist saints such as [[Milarepa]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and deities.  Different coloured haloes have specific meanings: orange for monks, green for the Buddha and other more elevated beings,&lt;ref&gt;including the [[Qianlong Emperor]] – see note below. Rhie, Marylin and Thurman, Robert (eds):''Wisdom And Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet'', p. 99, &amp; passim, 2000, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8109-2526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly figures have both a halo for the head, and another circular one for the body, the two often intersecting somewhere around the head or neck. Thin lines of gold often radiate outwards or inwards from the rim of the halo, and sometimes a whole halo is made up of these.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, pp 77, 176, 197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In India the head halo is called ''Prabhamandala'' or ''Siras-cakra'', while the full body halo is ''Prabhavali''.&lt;ref&gt; Gopinatha  Rao, T. A. (1985). [https://archive.org/details/cu31924071128825 Elements of Hindu Iconography].  pps. 31-32. [[Motilal Banarsidass]]. {{ISBN|9788120808782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate haloes and especially aureoles also appear in [[Hindu]] sculpture, where they tend to develop into architectural frames in which the original idea can be hard to recognise. [[Theravada]] Buddhism and [[Jainism]] did not use the halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.

In Asian art, the nimbus is often imagined as consisting not just of light, but of flames.  This type seems to first appear in Chinese bronzes of which the earliest surviving examples date from before 450.&lt;ref&gt;No doubt, as later, the same motif appeared in paintings, but none survive from this early.  L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, pp 86-7, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the flames may be very formalized, as in the regular little flames on the ring aureole surrounding many [[Chola]] bronzes and other classic Hindu sculptures of divinities, or very prominent, as with the more realistic flames, and sometimes smoke, shown rising to a peak behind many Tibetan Buddhist depictions of the "wrathful aspect" of divinities, and also in Persian miniatures of the classic period.  This type is also very rarely found, and on a smaller scale, in medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;See Didron&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  Sometimes a thin line of flames rise up from the edges of a circular halo in Buddhist examples.&lt;ref&gt;Often in paintings from the [[Dunhuang caves]], see Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, nos 42, 53, 54 etc, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tibetan paintings the flames are often shown as blown by a wind, usually from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Halos are found in [[Islamic art]] from various places and periods, especially in [[Persian miniature]]s and [[Moghul]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art influenced by them.  Flaming halos derived from Buddhist art surround angels, and similar ones are often seen [[Depiction of Muhammad|around Muhammad]] and other sacred human figures.  From the early 17th century, plainer round haloes appear in portraits of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] and subsequently [[Rajput]] and [[Sikh]] rulers;&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt; despite the more local precedents art historians believe the Mughals took the motif from European religious art, though it expresses a Persian idea of the God-given [[charisma]] of kingship that is far older.&lt;ref&gt;Crill &amp; Jariwala, 29 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] avoided using halos for the [[sultan]]s, despite their title as [[Caliph]], and they are only seen on Chinese emperors if they are posing as Buddhist religious figures, as some felt entitled to do.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Buddhist_Dress.jpg the Qianlong Emperor in Buddhist Dress], and his father.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Apollo]] with a radiant halo in a Roman floor [[mosaic]] (late 2nd century, [[El Djem]], Tunisia)]]

The halo represents an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] or the glow of sanctity which was conventionally drawn encircling the head. It first appeared in the culture of Hellenistic Greece and [[Rome]], possibly related to the [[Zoroastrian]] ''hvarena'' – "glory" or "divine lustre" – which marked the Persian kings, and may have been imported with [[Mithraism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E. H.|date=1941|title=The Halo: A Further Enquiry into Its Origin|jstor=868232|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|volume=78|issue=457|pages=123–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Roman paintings have largely disappeared, save some [[fresco]] decorations, the haloed figure remains fresh in Roman mosaics. In a 2nd-century AD Roman floor mosaic preserved at [[Le Bardo|Bardo]], Tunisia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/Z2.4.html Illustrated].&lt;/ref&gt; a haloed [[Poseidon]] appears in his chariot drawn by [[hippocamp]]s. Significantly, the [[triton (mythology)|triton]] and [[nereid]] who accompany the sea-god are not haloed.

In a late 2nd century AD floor mosaic from Thysdrus, [[El Djem]],   (''illustration'') [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] is identified by his effulgent halo.  Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Illustration |accessdate= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BC to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964; Yalouris 1980).  Sometime after this mosaic was executed, the Emperor began to be depicted with a halo,&lt;ref&gt;Initially only dead and therefore deified Emperors were haloed, later the living [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11080b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; which was not abandoned when they became Christian; initially Christ only had one when shown on a throne as [[Christ in Majesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11080b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Nimbus|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Christian art ==

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Early pre-4th century Mosaic of [[Sol Invictus]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''[[Constantine the Great]]'': "Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c. 250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in Mausoleum M in the pre-4th-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica]] – interpreted by many as representing Christ.]]

The halo was incorporated into [[Early Christian art]] sometime in the 4th century with the earliest [[icon]]ic images of Christ, initially the only figure shown with one (together with his symbol, the [[Lamb of God]]).  Initially the halo was regarded by many as a representation of the ''[[Logos]]'' of Christ, his divine nature, and therefore in very early (before 500) depictions of Christ before his Baptism by [[John the Baptist|John]] he tends not to be shown with a halo, it being a matter of debate whether his ''Logos'' was innate from conception (the Orthodox view), or acquired at Baptism (the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] view).  At this period he is also shown as a child or youth in ''Baptisms'', though this may be a hieratic rather than an age-related representation.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 135, figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölner Meister eines Evangelienbuches 001.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' and ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]'' of Christ, with cross haloes; the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], [[angel]]s and [[prophet]]s have plain ones. (1025–50, [[Cologne]]).]]

A '''cruciform halo''', that is to say a cross within, or extending beyond, a halo is used to represent the persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], especially [[Jesus]], and especially in medieval art.  In Byzantine and Orthodox images, inside each of the bars of the cross in Christ's halo is one of the [[Greek letter]]s Ο Ω Ν, making up {{lang|grc|[[I Am that I Am|ὁ ὢν]]}}—"ho ōn", literally, "the Existing One"—indicating the [[divinity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Christian Symbols |url=http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |publisher=Catholic Biblical Association of Canada |accessdate=20 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223120343/http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least in later Orthodox images, each bar of this cross is composed of three lines, symbolising the [[dogma]]s of the Trinity, the [[Divine simplicity|oneness of God]] and the [[Christology|two natures of Christ]].

In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-40) the juvenile Christ has a four-armed cross either on top of his head in the radius of the nimbus, or placed above the radius, but this is unusual.  In the same mosaics the accompanying angels have haloes (as, in a continuation of the Imperial tradition, does [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]), but not [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Occasionally other figures have crossed haloes, such as the seven doves representing the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] in the 11th century [[Codex Vyssegradensis]] [[Tree of Jesse]] (where [[Jesse]] and [[Isaiah]] also have plain haloes, as do the [[Ancestors of Christ]] in other miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs 20-22, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, triangular haloes are sometimes given to [[God the Father]] to represent the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo Nationalgallery.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223708/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo |date=23 April 2007 }},  Late 15th century reliefs by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] on the portal of San Petronio, Bologna are an early example of the triangular halo. According to Didron, Adolphe Napoléon: ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages'', London, 1851, Vol 2, p30, this is "extremely rare in France, but common enough in Italy and Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  When he is represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|hand emerging from a cloud]], this may be given a halo.

Plain round haloes are typically used to signify [[saint]]s, the Virgin Mary, [[Old Testament]] prophets, angels, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], and some other figures. [[Byzantine emperor]]s and empresses were often shown with them in compositions including saints or Christ, however the haloes were outlined only.  This was copied by Ottonian and later Russian rulers. Old Testament figures become less likely to have haloes in the West as the Middle Ages go on.&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp.68-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pope Paschalis I. in apsis mosaic of Santa Prassede in Rome.gif|thumb|right|180px|[[Pope Paschal I]] is depicted during his lifetime, so with a square halo, c. 820, [[Santa Prassede]], Rome.]]
[[Beatification|Beatified]] figures, not yet canonised as saints, are sometimes shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating out from the head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less obtrusive form of halo that could be used for all figures.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is observed in the ''Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven'' (1423-4) by [[Fra Angelico]], [[National Gallery, London]], where only the beatified saints at the edges have radiating linear haloes.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary has, especially from the [[Baroque]] period onwards, a special form of halo in a [[circle of stars|circle of twelve stars]], derived from her identification as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

'''Square haloes''' were sometimes used for the living in [[donor portrait]]s of about 500-1100 in Italy;&lt;ref&gt;only in Italy, according to Didron, Vol 2 p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving ones are of Popes and others in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, including the [[Episcopa Theodora]] head of the mother of the Pope of the day.  They seem merely an indication of a contemporary figure, as opposed to the saints usually accompanying them, with no real implication of future canonization. A late example is of [[Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino]], later Pope, from a manuscript of 1056–86;&lt;ref&gt;see Didron, Vol 2 p.79 and Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] had himself depicted with one, according to the 9th-century writer of his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'', [[John, deacon of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Diaconus gives the reason: ''circa verticem tabulae similitudinem, quod viventis insigne est, preferens, non-coronam'' ("bearing around his head the likeness of a square, which is the sign for a living person, and not a crown") ([[Migne]], ''Pat. Lat.'' 75, 231). The deacon of Rome was unaware of the Eastern tradition of depicting the emperor with a halo.  Surviving examples are rare, and seem to be becoming rarer; Bishop Ecclesius has a clear one in older photos of the mosaics in [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], which appears to have been removed in recent restoration [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SanVitale16.jpg Cupola of the choir] – see: James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p100 &amp; photo p.93, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}.  Other surviving examples are [[Pope Hadrian I]] in a mural formerly in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome, donor figures in the church at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]  [http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html and two more Roman examples – items 3 and 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630131544/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html |date=30 June 2007 }}, one of Paschal's mother, the rather mysterious [[Episcopa Theodora]]. see also: Fisher, Sally. ''The Square Halo and Other Mysteries of Western Art: Images and the Stories that Inspired Them''. Edited by Harriet Whelchel, Harry N Abrams, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure who may represent [[Moses]] in the 3rd century [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] has one, where no round halos are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dura_Europos_fresco_holy_man.jpg|title=Joshua.

Cecil Roth, Tel Aviv: Massadah Press, 1961, cols. 203-204: "Joshua").|first=made by photographer|last=Becklectic|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personifications of the [[Virtues]] are sometimes given [[hexagon]]al haloes.&lt;ref&gt;As in the frescoes by the workshop of Giotto in the lower church at Assisi. James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p202, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalloped haloes, sometimes just appearing as made of radiating bars, are found in the manuscripts of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] "Ada School", such as the [[Ada Gospels]].

The whole-body image of radiance is sometimes called the  '[[Aureola|aureole]]' or ''glory''; it is shown radiating from all round the body, most often of Christ or Mary, occasionally of saints (especially those reported to have been seen surrounded by one).  Such an aureola is often a [[mandorla]] ("almond-shaped" [[vesica piscis]]), especially around [[Christ in Majesty]], who may well have a halo as well.  In [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus]] a more complicated shape is often seen, especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, as in the famous 15th century icon in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp. 107-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gold is used as a background in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[mosaic]]s and panel paintings, the halo is often formed by inscribing lines in the [[gold leaf]], and may be decorated in patterns ([[diapering]]) within the outer radius, and thus becomes much less prominent.  The gold leaf inside the halo may also be burnished in a circular manner, so as to produce the effect of light radiating out from the subject's head. In the early centuries of its use, the Christian halo may be in most colours (though black is reserved for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], [[Satan]] and other evil figures) or multicoloured; later gold becomes standard, and if the entire background is not gold leaf, the halo itself usually will be.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Early Christian Art'', p. 112, 2000, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the halo ===
[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|left|290px|[[Fra Angelico]]. ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]''.  Note the haloes of the kneeling figures at the front, seen from behind.]]

With increasing [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting, the halo came to be a problem for artists.  So long as they continued to use the old compositional formulae which had been worked out to accommodate haloes, the problems were manageable, but as Western artists sought more flexibility in composition, this ceased to be the case.  In free-standing medieval [[sculpture]], the halo was already shown as a flat disk above or behind the head.  When [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] came to be considered essential, painters also changed the halo from an aura surrounding the head, always depicted as though seen full-on, to a flat golden disk or ring that appeared in perspective, floating above the heads of the saints, or vertically behind, sometimes transparent.  This can be seen first in [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], who still gives Christ the cruciform halo which began to be phased out by his successors.  In northern Europe the radiant halo, made up of rays like a [[sunburst]], came into fashion in French painting around the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Hugh. ''Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum'', p. 43, 1986, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Robert Campin]] largely abandoned their use, although some other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artists continued to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Haloes were also often added by later dealers and restorers to such works, and indeed sometimes used to convert portraits into "saints". [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neth/hd_neth.htm Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting, Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at around the same time, [[Pisanello]] used them if they did not clash with one of the enormous hats he liked to paint.  Generally they lasted longer in Italy, although often reduced to a thin gold band depicting the outer edge of the nimbus, usual for example in [[Giovanni Bellini]].  Christ began to be shown with a plain halo.
[[File:Madonna Benois.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (attributed),  ''[[The Benois Madonna|Benois Madonna]]''.  Floating semi-transparent haloes in perspective.]]

[[Fra Angelico]], himself a [[monk]], was a conservative as far as haloes are concerned, and some of his paintings demonstrate the problems well, as in several of his more crowded compositions, where they are shown as solid gold disks on the same plane as the picture surface, it becomes difficult to prevent them obstructing other figures.  At the same time they were useful in crowded narrative scenes for distinguishing the main, identifiable, figures from the mass of a crowd. [[Giotto]]'s [[Lamentation of Christ]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] has eight figures with haloes and ten without, to whom the viewer knows they are not meant to attach a specific identity. In the same way, a ''Baptism of Christ'' by [[Perugino]] in Vienna gives neither Christ nor [[John the Baptist]] haloes, as sufficiently recognisable without them, but a saint in the background, not usually present in this scene, has a ring halo to denote his status.&lt;ref&gt;If not their identity. The painting has been partly repainted, and the current appearance may not be the original one. [[:File:Pietro Perugino 077.jpg|Vienna Perugino]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], even most Italian painters dispensed with haloes altogether, but in the Church's reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that culminated in the [[Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|decrees on images of the Council of Trent]] of 1563, their use was mandated by clerical writers on religious art such as [[Molanus]] and Saint [[Carlo Borromeo]].  Figures were placed where natural light sources would highlight their heads, or instead more discreet quasi-naturalistic flickering or glowing light was shown around the head of Christ and other figures (perhaps pioneered by [[Titian]] in his late period). [[Rembrandt]]'s [[etching]]s, for example, show a variety of solutions of all of these types, as well as a majority with no halo effect at all.  The disk halo was rarely used for figures from [[classical mythology]] in the Renaissance, although they are sometimes seen, especially in the classical radiant form, in [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] art.

By the 19th century haloes have become unusual in Western mainstream art, although retained in iconic and popular images, and sometimes as a medievalising effect.  When [[John Millais]] gives his otherwise realist ''[[St Stephen]]'' (1895) a ring halo, it seems rather surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-saint-stephen-n01563|title=‘Saint Stephen’, Sir John Everett Millais, Bt, 1895 – Tate|first=|last=Tate|website=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular graphic culture, a simple ring has become the predominant representation of a halo since at least the late 19th century, as seen for example in the logo for the [[Simon Templar]] ("The Saint") series of novels and other adaptations.

== Spiritual significance in Christianity ==
[[File:Ushakov Nerukotvorniy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ "[[Not Made by Hand]]" with the Greek letters [[I Am that I Am|'''Ο''' &lt;big&gt;ὤ&lt;/big&gt; '''Ν''']]. [[Simon Ushakov]], 17th century.]]
The early [[Church Fathers]] expended much rhetorical energy on conceptions of God as a source of light; among other things this was because "in the controversies in the 4th century over the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, the relation of the ray to the source was the most cogent example of emanation and of distinct forms with a common substance" – key concepts in the theological thought of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Castelseprio (1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, p117, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[Catholic]] interpretation, less dualistic in its assumptions, is that the halo represents the light of divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and in harmony with the physical body.

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], an [[icon]] is a "window into heaven" through which Christ and the Saints in heaven can be seen and communicated with. The gold background of the icon indicates that what is depicted is in heaven. The halo is a symbol of the [[Uncreated Light]] (Greek: Ἄκτιστον Φῶς) or [[Divine grace|grace]] of God shining forth through the icon. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchies]]'' speaks of the angels and saints being illuminated by the grace of God, and in turn illumining others.

== Origins and usage of the different terms ==
[[File:Preobrazhenie.jpeg|thumb|Late Byzantine/Russian [[icon]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]. Christ is shown surrounded by a light blue aureole with white flashes of lightning (15th century,  attributed to [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

The distinction between the alternative terms in English is rather unclear.  The oldest term in English is "glory", the only one available in the [[Middle Ages]], but now largely obsolete. It came from the French "gloire" which has much the same range of meanings as "glory".  "Gloriole" does not appear in this sense until 1844, being a modern invention, as a diminutive, in French also. "Halo" is first found in English in this sense in 1646 (nearly a century after the optical or astronomical sense). Both "halos" and "haloes" may be used as plural forms, and halo may be used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "glory", "gloriole" and "halo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Halo comes originally from the Greek for "threshing-floor" – a circular, slightly sloping area kept very clean, around which slaves or oxen walked to thresh the grain.  In Greek, this came to mean the divine bright disk.

Nimbus means a cloud in Latin and is found as a divine cloud in 1616, whereas as "a bright or golden disk surrounding the head" it does not appear until 1727.  The plural "nimbi" is correct but "rare"; "nimbuses" is not in the OED but sometimes used. "Nimb" is an obsolete form of the noun, but not a verb, except that the obsolete "nimbated", like the commoner "nimbate", means "furnished with a nimbus".  It is sometimes preferred by art-historians, as sounding more technical than halo.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "nimbus" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aureole", from the Latin for "golden", has been used in English as a term for a gold crown, especially that traditionally considered the reward of [[martyr]]s, since the Middle Ages (OED 1220).  But the first use recorded as a term for a halo is in 1848, very shortly after which matters were greatly complicated by the publication in 1851 of the English translation of [[Adolphe Napoléon Didron]]'s important ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages''.  This, by what the OED calls a "strange blunder", derived the word from the Latin "aura" as a diminutive, and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body, whilst saying that "nimbus" referred only to a halo around the head.  This, according to the OED, reversed the historical usage of both words, but whilst Didron's diktat was "not accepted in France", the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries, and influenced usage in English, which still seems to be the case, as the word "nimbus" is mostly found describing whole-body haloes, and seems to have also influenced "gloriole" in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "aureole".&lt;/ref&gt;

The only English term that unequivocally means a full-body halo, and cannot be used for a circular disk around the head is "[[mandorla]]", first occurring in 1883.  However, this term, which is the Italian word for "[[almond]]", is usually reserved for the [[vesica piscis]] shape, at least in describing Christian art.  In discussing Asian art, it is used more widely.&lt;ref&gt;For example by Sickman and Soper, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, there could be said to be an excess of words that could refer to either a head-disk or a full-body halo, and no word that clearly denotes a full-body halo that is not vesica piscis shaped.  "Halo" by itself, according to recent dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995, and Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; means only a circle around the head, although Rhie and Thurman use the word also for circular full-body aureoles.&lt;ref&gt;op &amp; pages cit.  The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 (link above) has a further set of meanings for these terms, including glory.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
'''Harshness''' (also called '''raucousness'''), in [[music information retrieval]], is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional [[psychoacoustic]] feature called as musical [[timbre]].

Classical timbre’ NLDs are [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[spectral centroid]], and [[spectral flux]]. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]], single-[[Musical note|note]], musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.

'''Hau''' is a notion made popular by the French anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] in his 1925 book ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss M., ''The gift; forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies'', Translated by Ian Gunnison with an Introduction by . E. [[Evans-Pritchard]], London: Cohen and West, 1966: [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the practice of gifting, he came to the conclusion that it involved belief in a force binding the receiver and giver. The term 'Hau', used by the [[Māori people|Maori]], became a paradigmatic example for such a view.&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack G., Mauss and the 'Spirit'of the Gift, Oceania,  Vol. 52, No. 4, Jun., 1982 p.286 [[Jstor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing at the turn of the century{{when?|date=August 2014}}, Mauss relied on limited sources but his analysis has been expanded and refined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], ''The enigma of the gift''.

'''Ichthyology''' (from Greek: [[wikt:ἰχθύς|ἰχθύς]], ''ikhthys'', "fish"; and λόγος, ''logos'', "study"), also known as '''fish science''', is the branch of [[zoology]] devoted to the study of [[fish]].  This includes bony fish ([[Osteichthyes]]), cartilaginous fish ([[Chondrichthyes]]), and jawless fish ([[Agnatha]]). While a large number of species have been discovered, approximately 250 new species are officially described by science each  year. According to [[FishBase]], 33,400 species of fish had been described by October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]: [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php October 2016 Update.] Retrieved 7 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mimbres fish.jpg|thumb|Fish represent approximately 8% of all figurative depictions on [[Mimbres pottery]].|alt=Photo of square side of pottery showing fish with skewed checkered pattern on its skin. Zig-zag lines represent waves at the top and bottom.]]

The study of fish dates from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic Revolution]] (with the advent of "high culture"). The science of ichthyology was developed in several interconnecting epochs, each with various significant advancements.

The study of fish receives its origins from human's desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. According to [[Michael Barton (professor)|Michael Barton]], a prominent ichthyologist and professor at [[Centre College]], "the earliest ichthyologists were hunters and gatherers who had learned how to obtain the most useful fish, where to obtain them in abundance, and at what times they might be the most available". Early cultures manifested these insights in abstract and identifiable artistic expressions.

===1500 BC–40 AD===
Informal, scientific descriptions of fish are represented within the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. The Old Testament laws of [[kashrut]] forbade the consumption of fish without scales or appendages.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Theologians]] and ichthyologists believe that the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and his contemporaries harvested the fish that are today sold in modern industry along the [[Sea of Galilee]], presently known as [[Lake Kinneret]]. These fish include [[cyprinid]]s of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Barbus]]'' and ''[[Mirogrex]]'', [[cichlid]]s of the genus ''[[Sarotherodon]]'', and ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mugilidae]].

=== 335 BC–80 AD ===

[[Aristotle]] incorporated ichthyology into formal scientific study. Between 335 BC–322 BC, he provided the earliest [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of fish, accurately describing 117 species of [[Mediterranean]] fish. Furthermore, Aristotle documented [[anatomy|anatomical]] and behavioral differences between [[fish]] and [[marine mammal]]s. After his death, some of his pupils continued his ichthyological research. [[Theophrastus]], for example, composed a [[treatise]] on amphibious fish. The Romans, although less devoted to science, wrote extensively about fish. [[Pliny the Elder]], a notable Roman [[natural history|naturalist]], compiled the ichthyological works of indigenous [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s, including verifiable and ambiguous peculiarities such as the [[sawfish]] and [[mermaid]] respectively. Pliny's documentation was the last significant contribution to ichthyology until the [[European Renaissance]].

=== European Renaissance ===

The writings of three sixteenth century scholars, [[Hippolito Salviani]], [[Pierre Belon]], and [[Guillaume Rondelet]], signify the conception of modern ichthyology. The investigations of these individuals were based upon actual research in comparison to ancient recitations. This property popularized and emphasized these discoveries. Despite their prominence, Rondelet's ''[[De Piscibus Marinis]]'' is regarded as the most influential, identifying 244 species of fish.

=== 16th–17th century ===

The incremental alterations in navigation and shipbuilding throughout the Renaissance marked the commencement of a new epoch in ichthyology. The Renaissance culminated with the era of exploration and colonization, and upon the cosmopolitan interest in navigation came the specialization in naturalism. [[Georg Marcgrave]] of [[Saxony]] composed the ''Naturalis Brasilae'' in 1648. This document contained a description of 100 species of fish indigenous to the [[Brazil]]ian coastline. In 1686, [[John Ray]] and [[Francis Willughby]] collaboratively published ''[[Historia Piscium]]'', a scientific manuscript containing 420 species of fish, 178 of these newly discovered. The fish contained within this informative literature were arranged in a provisional system of classification.

[[File:Deckblatt zu einem der Hauptwerke von Peter Artedi.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' by Peter Artedi]]
The classification used within the ''Historia Piscium'' was further developed by [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father of modern taxonomy". His [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] approach became the systematic approach to the study of organisms, including fish. Linnaeus was a professor at the [[University of Uppsala]] and an eminent [[botany|botanist]]; however, one of his colleagues, [[Peter Artedi]], earned the title "father of ichthyology" through his indispensable advancements. Artedi contributed to Linnaeus's refinement of the principles of taxonomy. Furthermore, he recognized  five additional [[order (biology)|orders]] of fish: Malacopterygii, Acanthopterygii, Branchiostegi, Chondropterygii, and [[Plagiuri]]. Artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements of anatomical features that are modernly exploited. Another associate of Linnaeus, [[Albertus Seba]], was a prosperous [[pharmacist]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Seba assembled a cabinet, or collection, of fish. He invited Artedi to utilize this assortment of fish; unfortunately, in 1735, Artedi fell into an Amsterdam canal and drowned at the age of 30.

Linnaeus posthumously published Artedi's manuscripts as ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' (1738). His refinement of taxonomy culminated in the development of the [[binomial nomenclature]] which is in use by contemporary ichthyologists. Furthermore, he revised the orders introduced by Artedi, placing significance on [[pelvic fin]]s. Fish lacking this appendage were placed within the order Apodes; fish containing abdominal, thoracic, or jugular pelvic fins were termed Abdominales, Thoracici, and Jugulares respectively. However, these alterations were not grounded within evolutionary theory. Therefore, it would take over a century until [[Charles Darwin]] would provide the intellectual foundation from which we would be permitted to perceive that the degree of similarity in taxonomic features was a consequence of [[phylogenetic]] relationship.

=== Modern era ===

Close to the dawn of the nineteenth century, [[Marcus Elieser Bloch]] of [[Berlin]] and [[Georges Cuvier]] of [[Paris]] made attempts to consolidate the knowledge of ichthyology. Cuvier summarized all of the available information in his monumental ''[[Histoire Naturelle des Poissons]]''. This manuscript was published between 1828 and 1849 in a 22 volume series. This documental describes 4,514 species of fish, 2,311 of these new to science. It remains one of the most ambitious treatises of the modern world. Scientific exploration of the Americas advanced our knowledge of the remarkable [[diversity of fish]]. [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]] was a student of Cuvier. He made a cabinet of fish dwelling within the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]] regions.

Adventurous individuals such as [[John James Audubon]] and [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] figure in the faunal documentation of [[North America]]. These persons often traveled with one another. Rafinesque wrote ''[[Ichthyologia Ohiensis]]'' in 1820. In addition, [[Louis Agassiz]] of [[Switzerland]] established his reputation through the study of freshwater fish and the first comprehensive treatment of paleoichthyology, Poissons Fossiles. In the 1840s, Agassiz moved to the [[United States]], where he taught at [[Harvard University]] until his death in 1873.

[[Albert Günther]] published his ''[[Catalogue of the Fish of the British Museum]]'' between 1859 and 1870, describing over 6,800 species and mentioning another 1,700. Generally considered one of the most influential ichthyologists, [[David Starr Jordan]] wrote 650 articles and books on the subject as well as serving as president of [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] and [[Stanford University]].

The term '''incubous''' describes the way in which the leaves of a [[liverwort]] are attached to the stem.  If one were to look down from above ([[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side) on a plant where the leaf attachment is ''incubous'', the upper edge of each leaf would overlap the next higher leaf along the stem.  Because of this, the upper edge of each leaf is visible from above, but the lower edge of each leaf is obscured by its neighboring leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Wigginton, M.

'''Informal learning''' is any learning that is not [[formal learning]] or [[non-formal learning]], such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.

The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education.  The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in [[communities of practice]], to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to [[observational learning|observe]] and participate in social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizations==
[[File:Open House Day 2015 Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Open House Day at [[ESO]]’s Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House Day 2015 – Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1526a/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Informal learning can be characterized as the following:
* It usually takes place outside [[education]]al [[school|establishments]];
* It does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements;
* It is not necessarily planned [[pedagogically]], systematically according to fixed [[course (education)|subject]]s, [[test (student assessment)|test]] and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for [[life]];
* It is experienced directly in its "[[Nature (philosophy)|natural]]" function of everyday life.
* It is often spontaneous and creative.
* It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] (LOPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching-In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities.

==History==
In international discussions, the concept of informal learning, already used by [[John Dewey]] at an early stage and later on by [[Malcolm Knowles]], experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and [[nonformal learning]] in courses ([[P. H. Coombs|Coombs]]/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions ([[K. Watkins|Watkins]]/Marsick, p.&amp;nbsp;12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards [[autodidactic]] and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner ([[D. W. Livingstone|Livingstone]] 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68 et seq.).

==Differences between informal and non-formal learning==
{{main|Non-formal learning}}
As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars.

==Other perspective==
Merriam et al. (2007) state: "Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990, p. 6)" (p.&amp;nbsp;36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as "a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images" (Bennett, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4) and she theorized two possible sub-processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge.

==In American Indigenous communities==
People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=B|author2=L. Alcala |author3=A. Coppens |author4=A. Lopez |author5=O. Ruvalcaba |author6=K. Silva |title=Pitching in and catching on: Learning through intent community participation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These learning experiences rely on children’s incorporation in the community and the child’s attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in.

Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pewewardy|first1=Cornel|title=Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska native students: A review of the literature and implications for practice|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=2002|volume=41|issue=3|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvit.bc.ca/docs/learning%20styles%20of%20american%20indianalaska%20native%20students%20a%20review%20of%20the%20literature%20and%20implications%20for%20practice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Children can be seen participating alongside adults in many daily activities within the community. An example is the process where children learn slash-and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskins|first=S|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico|last = Alcala|first = et. al.|date = 2014|journal = Human Development |doi = 10.1159/000356763|pmid = |access-date =|volume=57|issue = 2–3|pages=96–115|bibcode = 2001HuDev..44..103S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors. Their roles as learner and expert are flexible, while the observer participates with active concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R|author2=B. Rogoff2|title=Side-by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychology and Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]], experiential learning, and apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=M|title=Indigenous Knowledge and Research: The Míkiwáhp as a Symbol for Reclaiming Our Knowledge and Ways of Knowing|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/26/64|journal=The First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]], alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children’s time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göncü|first=A.|title=Children’s and researchers’ engagement in the world|journal=Library of Congress Catalog|year=1999|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the-holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children |journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 55–66|volume = 38|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|first = Pablo|last = Chavajay|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Rogoff|pmid=11806702|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is part of a child’s development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=M.|author2=D. Levison |author3=D. White |author4=W. Myers |title=A place for work in children’s lives?|journal=Plan|year=2009|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circumstances of everyday routine create opportunities for the culturally meaningful activities and sensitive interactions on which a child's development depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farver|first=J.A.M.|title=Activity setting analysis: A model for examining the role of culture in development|journal=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1999|pages=99–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of the Chillihuani observe their environment as a place of respect, and learn from observation. Many of them become herders by informal learning in observation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-70982-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebel|first=M.|title=The dignity of the working child: What children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala think about their work|journal=Working Children's Protagonism: Social Movements and Empowerment in Latin America, Africa and India|year=2001|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children’s social interaction and behavior occur.  Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskin|first=S.|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication as a learning tool===

In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture’s definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the native american student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain.In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. "Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development." Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3195944|title = Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to be Separate-but-Together|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 156–172|last1 = Paradise|first1 = Ruth|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ennew | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Growing up in a culture of respect: child rearing in highland Peru – By Bolin, Inge | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 168–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01604_5.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, E., &amp; Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal and informal education==
To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms "formal" and "informal" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic,  while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students.

==Research and data==
Merriam and others (2007) state: "studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, &amp; Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs" (p.&amp;nbsp;35–36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form.

==Experiences and examples==
Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, "At the Water Cooler of Learning" in Conner, M. L., &amp; Clawson, J.G. (eds.) "Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of [[language acquisition]], a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a 
formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). "Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non-Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring.

Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager.

Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person.

In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in "The Learning Revolution" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries—which offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, "meet the author" events and family history sessions—to run activities such as [http://www.northeastlibraries.org.uk The North East Festival of Learning].

==Trends in formal and informal learning==
40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and [[situational]] in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on [[on-the-job training]].

Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and [[interpersonal skills]] that the “unskilled” labor force requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.

==Business perspective==
The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part—25%—of the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively "adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything.

==Summary==
Lifelong learning, as defined by the [[OECD]], includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

[[File:EURO 68 wooden window profile with insulated glazing 02.JPG|thumb|EURO 68 wooden window profile with insulated glazing]]
'''Insulating glass''' ('''IG'''), more commonly known as '''double glazing''' (or '''double-pane''', and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists of two or three [[glass]] [[Paned window|window panes]] separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce [[heat transfer]] across a part of the [[building envelope]].

Insulating glass units (IGUs) are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (1/8" to 3/8") or more in special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass used on both panes{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but special applications such as [[acoustic attenuation]] or&amp;nbsp;security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.

[[File:Double Glazed Fixed Window Diagram.png|thumb|A [[Cross section (geometry)|sectioned]] diagram of a fixed insulating glass unit (IGU), indicating the numbering convention used in this article. Surface #1 is facing outside, Surface #2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface #3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface #4  is the inside surface of interior pane. The window [[Window#Frame and sash construction|frame]] is labelled #5, a [[Insulated glazing#Spacer|spacer]] is indicated as #6, seals are shown in red (#7), the internal [[molding (decorative)|reveal]] is on the right hand side (#8) and the exterior [[Window#Technical terms|windowsill]] on the left (#9)]]

==Double-hung and storm windows==
[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glass windows with uPVC frames]]
Insulating glass is an evolution from older technologies known as [[double-hung window]]s and [[storm window]]s. Traditional double-hung windows used a single pane of glass to separate the interior and exterior spaces.
* In the summer, a [[window screen]] would be installed on the exterior over the double-hung window to keep out animals and insects.
* In the winter, the screen was removed and replaced with a [[storm window]], which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active.
Traditional storm windows and screens are relatively time consuming and labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage of the storm windows in the spring, and reinstallation in the fall and storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.
However, current reproductions of these old-style storm windows can be made with detachable glass in the bottom pane that can be replaced with a detachable screen when desired. This eliminates the need for changing the entire storm window according to the seasons.

Insulated glazing forms a very compact multi-layer sandwich of air and glass, which eliminates the need for storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house hto service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood framed due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.

Modern window units with IG typically completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between the upper and lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.

==Spacer==
[[File:Spacers 1.jpg|thumb|Spacer: 9.5/13.5/19.5 mm]]
The glass panes are separated by a "spacer". A spacer, also known as a [[warm edge]],  is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an insulating glass system, and seals the gas space between them. Historically, spacers were made primarily of metal and fiber, which manufacturers thought provided more durability.

However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless the metal is thermally improved), undermining the ability of the '''insulated glass unit (IGU)''' to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming at the bottom of the sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces [[condensation]] on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall [[Thermal transmittance|U-value]].
* A spacer that reduces heat flow in glazing configurations may also have characteristics for sound dampening where external noise is an issue.
* Typically, spacers are filled with or contain [[desiccant]] to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.
* New technology has emerged to combat the heat loss from traditional spacer bars, including improvements to the structural performance and long-term-durability of improved metal (aluminum with a thermal barrier) and foam spacers.

== Construction ==
IGUs are often manufactured on a made to order basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, the thickness of the glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.

[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|265px|Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with insulated glazing]]

An adhesive sealant ([[polyisobutylene]]) is applied to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either [[polysulfide]] or [[silicone sealant]] or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.

The insulating glazing unit, consisting of two glass panes bound together into a single unit with a seal between the edges of the panes, was patented in the United States by Thomas Stetson in 1865.&lt;ref name=Stetson&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number= 49167 |status = patent |title = Improvement in Window Glass |gdate = 1865-08-12 |invent1 = Stetson, Thomas D. | class = ECLA classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials: History and Conservation |editor1-first=Thomas C. |editor1-last=Jester |publisher=Getty Publications |date=2014 |isbn=9781606063255 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kn9DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273}} See note 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Their product was sold under the Thermopane brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The Thermopane technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} typical of modern units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Wilson |title=The Revolution in Window Performance — Part 1 |work=Green Building Advisor |date=March 22, 2012  |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/revolution-window-performance-part-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brand name Thermopane has entered the vocabulary of the glazing industry as the [[genericized trademark]] for any IGU.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Thermal performance ==
The maximum insulating efficiency of a standard IGU is determined by the thickness of the space. Typically, most sealed units achieve maximum insulating values using a space of {{convert|16|-|19|mm|in|abbr=on}} when measured at the centre of the IGU.

IGU thickness is a compromise between maximizing insulating value and the ability of the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.

This trade-off does not apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as heat loss due to [[convection]] is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and [[Heat conduction|conduction]] through the edge seal and required supporting pillars over the face area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassfiles.com/library/article.php?id=1174&amp;search=evacuated&amp;page=1 |title=Development and quality control of vacuum glazing by N. Ng and L. So; University of Sydney |publisher=Glassfiles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="VIGLBL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Insulated Glazing (VIG)|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/vacuum-insulated-glazing-vig|website=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete [[vacuum]]. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit (powdered glass) having a reduced melting point is heated to join the components. This creates a glass seal that experiences increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may limit the maximum allowable temperature differential. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35&amp;nbsp;°C. Closely spaced pillars are required to reinforce the glazing to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. Pillar spacing and diameter limited the insulation achieved by designs available beginning in the 1990s to R = 4.7 h·°F·ft2/BTU (0.83 m2·K/W) no better than high quality double glazed insulated glass units. Recent products claim performance of  R = 14 h·°F·ft2/BTU (2.5 m2·K/W) which exceeds triple glazed insulated glass units.&lt;ref name="VIGLBL" /&gt; The required internal pillars exclude applications where an unobstructed view through the glazing unit is desired, i.e. most residential and commercial windows, and refrigerated food display cases.

Vacuum technology is also used in some non-transparent [[thermal insulation|insulation]] products called [[vacuum insulated panel]]s.

An older-established way to improve insulation performance is to replace air in the space with a lower [[thermal conductivity]] gas. Gas convective heat transfer is a function of viscosity and specific heat. [[noble gas|Monatomic gases]] such as [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are often used since (at normal temperatures) they do not carry heat in rotational [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|modes]], resulting in a lower [[heat capacity]] than poly-atomic gases. Argon has a thermal conductivity 67% that of air, krypton has about half the conductivity of argon.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_3/2_3_7.html |title=Kaye and Laby. Thermal conductivities of gases |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Argon is almost 1% of the atmosphere and isolated at a moderate cost. Krypton and xenon are only trace components of the atmosphere and very expensive. All of  these "noble" gases are non-toxic, clear, odorless, chemically inert, and commercially available because of their widespread application in industry.  Some manufacturers also offer [[sulfur hexafluoride]] as an insulating gas, especially to insulate sound. It has only 2/3 the conductivity of argon, but it is stable, inexpensive and dense. However, sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In Europe, {{chem|SF|6}} falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, {{chem|SF|6}} is banned as a [[tracer gas]] and in all applications except [[high-voltage switchgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/climate-meps-give-gas-bill-green-boost/article-145749|title=F-gas and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; restrictions|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the more effective a fill gas is at its optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Handbook, Volume 1, Fundamentals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is difficult to determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin double glazing units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ktu.lt/ultra/journal/pdf_51_2/51-2004-Vol.2_01-J.Butkus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat insulating properties==
The effectiveness of insulated glass can be expressed as an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]. The higher the R-value, the greater is its resistance to heat transfer.  A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W.

Using US [[customary units]], a rule of thumb in standard IGU construction is that each change in the component of the IGU results in an increase of 1 R-value to the efficiency of the unit. Adding argon gas increases the efficiency to about R-3. Using low emissivity glass on surface #2 will add another R-value. Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5. Certain vacuum insulated glass units (VIGU) or multi-chambered IG units using coated plastic films result in R-values as high as R-12.5

Additional layers of glazing provide the opportunity for improved insulation. While the standard double glazing is most widely used, triple glazing is not uncommon, and quadruple glazing is produced for very cold environments such as Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96m36VQHlE8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;source=bl&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 February 1980|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/quadruple-glazed-house-uses-geothermal-pump-to-maintain-a-constant-temperature/|title=Quadruple-Glazed House Uses Geothermal Pump to Maintain a Constant Temperature|author=|date=|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even quintuple glazing (four cavities, five panes) is available - with mid-pane insulation factors equivalent to walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenspec.buildinggreen.com/blogs/top-products-greenbuild-expo-floor-windows|title=Green Products|author=|date=|website=buildinggreen.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/superwindows-rescue|title=‘Superwindows’ To the Rescue?|author=|date=|website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic insulating properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
In some situations the insulation is in reference to [[noise mitigation]]. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or [[sound transmission class]]. Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, [[sulfur hexafluoride]] can be used to replace or augment an inert gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUxCGJd0owC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=hexafluoride+insulating+glass&amp;source=web&amp;ots=niJxrJZMBa&amp;sig=DQwDhsPWasPns4IgA4tJtyR_YXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |title=Sound insulation - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improve acoustical attenuation performance.

Other glazing material variations affect acoustics. The most widely used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.

Reviewing the glazing system components, including the air space material used in the insulating glass, can ensure overall sound transmission improvement.

== Longevity ==
The life of an IGU varies depending on the quality of materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives.  IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a [[warranty]] for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer.  If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a solar control film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer.

The Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmaonline.org |title=IGMA |publisher=Igmaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook an extensive study to characterize the failures of commercial insulating glass units over a 25-year period.

For a standard construction IG unit, condensation collects between the layers of glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the desiccant has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in a significant factor in the overall cost of owning IGUs.

Large temperature differences between the inner and outer panes stress the spacer adhesives, which can eventually fail. Units with a small gap between the panes are more prone to failure because of the increased stress.

Atmospheric pressure changes combined with wet weather can, in rare cases, eventually lead to the gap filling with water.

The flexible sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals can be difficult to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.

In Canada, since the beginning of 1990, there are some companies offering servicing of failed IG units. They provide open ventilation to the atmosphere by drilling hole(s) in the glass and/or spacer. This solution often reverses the visible condensation, but cannot clean the interior surface of the glass and staining that may have occurred after long-term exposure to moisture. They may offer a warranty from 5 to 20 years. This solution lowers the insulating value of the window, but it can be a "green" solution when the window is still in good condition. If the IG unit had a gas fill (e.g. argon or krypton or a mixture) the gas is naturally dissipated and the R-value suffers.

Since 2004, there are also some companies offering the same restoration process for failed double-glazed units in the UK, and there is one company offering restoration of failed IG units in Ireland since 2010.

=== Thermal stress cracking ===
Thermal stress cracking isn't different for insulated glazing and uninsulated glazing. Temperature differences across the surface of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where the glass is partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight. Tinted glass increases heating and thermal stress, while annealing reduces internal stress built into the glass during manufacturing leaving more strength available to resist thermal cracking. &lt;ref&gt;Viracon Corporation, Owatonna, MN, "Tech Talk: Thermal stress cracking", 2001, http://www.viracon.com/images/pdf/TTThermalStress.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal expansion creates internal pressure, or stress, where expanding warm material is retrained by cooler material. A crack may form if the stress exceeds the material strength and the crack will propagate until the stress at the tip of the crack is below the material's strength. Typically cracks initiate and propagate from the narrow shaded cut edge where the material is weak and the stress is spread over a small glass volume compared to the open area. Glass thickness has no direct effect on thermal cracking in windows because both thermal stress and material strength are proportional to thickness. While thicker glass will have more strength remaining after supporting wind loads, that's usually only a significant factor for large glazing units on tall buildings and wind improves heat dissipation. Increased resistance to cracking with thicker glazing in common residential and commercial applications is more reliably result of using tempered glass to satisfy building safety codes requiring its use to reduce the severity of injuries when broken. Cut edge stresses have to be reduced by annealing prior to tempering and that removes stress concentrations created during glass cutting and that significantly increases the stress required to initiate a crack from the edge. The cost to process tempered glass is much greater than the cost difference between 1/8" (3 mm) glass and 3/16" (5 mm) or 1/4" (6.5 mm) material, prompting glaziers to suggest replacing cracked glazing with thicker glass. It may also avoid revealing to the customer that tempered glass should have been used initially.

== Estimating heat loss from double-glazed windows ==
Given the thermal properties of the sash, frame, and sill, and the dimensions of the glazing and thermal properties of the glass, the heat transfer rate for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated.
This can be calculated in kW (kilowatts), but more usefully for cost benefit calculations can be stated as kWh pa (kilowatt hours per annum), based on the typical conditions over a year for a given location.

The glass panels in double-glazed windows transmit heat in both directions by radiation, through the glazing by conduction and across the gap between the panes by convection, by conduction through the frame, and by infiltration around the perimeter seals and the frame's seal to the building. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. Unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains at night in the winter and using sun shades during the day in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a "Window Energy Rating" WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Connie C.|title=energy and acoustic solutions|url=http://thermotekwindows.com.au/products/double-glazed-doors-windows/|website=THERMOTEK|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[petroleum engineering]], a '''Klinkenberg correction''' is a procedure for calibration of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] data obtained from a [[minipermeameter]] device. A more accurate correction factor can be obtained using [[Knudsen diffusion|Knudsen correction]]. When using [[nitrogen]] gas for [[core plug (petroleum engineering)|core plug]] measurements, the Klinkenberg correction is usually necessary due to the so-called Klinkenberg gas slippage effect. This takes place  when the pore space approaches the mean free path of the gas

==Theory==
Under [[steady state]] and [[laminar flow]] condition, Klinkenberg&lt;ref&gt;Klinkenberg, L. J.: 1941, The permeability of porous media to liquids and gases, Drilling and Production Practice, American Petroleum Inst., pp. 200–213&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the permeability of porous media to gases is approximately a linear function of the reciprocal pressure.

When Klinkenberg defined the interactions to be considered, he supposed the existence of a layer (sometimes called Knudsen layer), thinner than molecular mean free path, adjacent to the pore’s wall where only molecules-wall  collisions would occur and collisions among molecules could be ignored. Thus the slippage velocity, as obtained from the Klinkenberg’s approach, captures the contribution of molecule-wall interactions and when this velocity is zero, the Poiseuille velocity profile (which results from molecule-molecule interactions) is recovered. However, Klinkenberg’s formulation ignores the transition flow region, where neither molecule-molecule nor molecule-wall interactions can be neglected because both are playing a relevant role.&lt;ref&gt;Bravo, M.C. Effect of transition from slip to free molecular flow on gas transport in porous media, J. Appl. Phys. 102, 074905 _2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of Klinkenberg linear function of the reciprocal pressure depends on the Knudsen number. For Knudsen numbers from 0.01 to 0.1 the Klinkenberg approach is acceptable.

==Application==
Permeability is measured in the laboratory by encasing a core plug of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known [[viscosity]] is injected into the core plug while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either full diameter core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6&amp;nbsp;inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using [[Darcy's law]].

Normally, either [[nitrogen]] or [[brine]] can be used as a fluid. When high rates of flow can be maintained, the results are comparable. At low rates, [[air permeability]] will be higher than brine permeability. This is because gas does not adhere to the pore walls as liquid does, and the slippage of gases along the pore walls gives rise to an apparent dependence of permeability on pressure. This is called the Klinkenberg effect, and it is especially important in low-permeable rocks.

In probe permeametry (mini-permeameter) measurement nitrogen gas is injected from the probe into core through a probe sealed to a core slab by a [[gasket]]. The gas flows from the end of a small-diameter tube that is sealed against the core surface. The pressure in the probe and the corresponding volumetric gas flow rate is measured together. The gas permeability is determined by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;K_g = C q_1 \mu_g \frac{P_1}{a} G (P_1^2 - P_2^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
          
Where,

:&lt;math&gt;K_g&lt;/math&gt;: Gas permeability
:&lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;: Flow rate
:&lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;: Injection pressure
:&lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;: Atmospheric pressure
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_g&lt;/math&gt;: Gas viscosity
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;: Internal radius of tip seal
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;: Geometric factor (halfspace solution)
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;: Constant (unit conversion)

Obviously what can be obtained from minipermeameter measurement is gas permeability. Gas slippage will occur during the measurement because nitrogen is injected quickly from probe to core and it is very difficult to get to equilibrium in very short time span. Therefore, to get the permeability equivalent to the brine permeability at formation condition Klinkenberg calibration is necessary.

The '''left-brain interpreter''' is a [[neuropsychological]] concept developed by the psychologist [[Michael S. Gazzaniga]] and the neuroscientist [[Joseph E. LeDoux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gazzaniga |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael S.

Discovering the Networks of the Mind |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the construction of explanations by the [[left brain hemisphere]] in order to make sense of the world by reconciling new information with what was known before.&lt;ref&gt;''Neurosociology: The Nexus Between Neuroscience and Social Psychology'' by David D. Franks 2010 {{ISBN|1-4419-5530-5}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; The left-brain interpreter attempts to rationalize, reason and generalize new information it receives in order to relate the past to the present.&lt;ref name=Daniel &gt;''The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers'' by Daniel L. Schacter 2002 {{ISBN|0-618-21919-6}} page 159 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m8qMjPF1NYAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22left+brain+interpreter%22+inferences+rationalizations&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L1-sTpa9M8Xvsgbn3tz1Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22left%20brain%20interpreter%22%20inferences%20rationalizations&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-brain interpretation is a case of the [[lateralization of brain function]] that applies to "explanation generation" rather than other lateralized activities.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga &gt;''The cognitive neuroscience of mind: a tribute to Michael S. Gazzaniga'' edited by Patricia A. Reuter-Lorenz, Kathleen Baynes, George R. Mangun, and Elizabeth A. Phelps; The MIT Press; 2010; {{ISBN|0-262-01401-7}}; pages 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of the left-brain interpreter was initially based on experiments on patients with [[split-brain]]s, it has since been shown to apply to the everyday behavior of people at large.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga /&gt;

==Discovery==
The concept was first introduced by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] while he performed research on [[split-brain]] patients during the early 1970s with [[Roger Sperry]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotions' page 44"&gt;''Handbook of the Sociology of Emotions'' by Jan E. Stets, Jonathan H. Turner 2007 {{ISBN|0-387-73991-2}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boller &gt;''Handbook of Neuropsychology: Introduction (Section 1) and Attention'' by François Boller, Jordan Grafman 2000 {{ISBN|0-444-50367-6}} pages 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Sperry eventually received the 1981 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for his contributions to split-brain research.&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. (1994). "Roger W. Sperry (1913–1994)". Trends in Neurosciences 17 (10): 402–404.&lt;/ref&gt;

In performing the initial experiments, Gazzaniga and his colleagues observed what happened when  the left and right hemispheres in the split brains of patients were unable to communicate with each other. In these experiments when patients were shown an image within the right visual field (which maps to the left brain hemisphere), an explanation of what was seen could be provided. However, when the image was only presented to the left visual field (which maps to the right brain hemisphere) the patients stated that they didn’t see anything.&lt;ref name=Boller /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maisto &gt;''Understanding psychology'' by Charles G. Morris and Albert A. Maisto 2009 {{ISBN|0-205-76906-3}} pages 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GazzanigaAmerican &gt;Michael Gazzaniga, ''The split brain revisited''. [[Scientific American]] 297 (1998), pp. 51–55. 37 [http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/~phils4/splitbrain.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when asked to point to objects similar to the image, the patients succeeded. Gazzaniga interpreted this by postulating that although the right brain could see the image it could not generate a verbal response to describe it.&lt;ref name=GazzanigaAmerican /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maisto /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boller /&gt;

==Experiments==
Since the initial discovery, a number of more detailed experiments have been performed&lt;ref name=Gazza1192 /&gt; to further clarify how the left brain "interprets" new information to assimilate and justify it. These experiments have included the projection of specific images, ranging from facial expressions to carefully constructed word combinations, and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) tests.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt;&lt;ref name=GazzanigaAmerican /&gt;

Many of the studies and experiments build on the initial approach of Gazzaniga in which the right hemisphere is instructed to do things that the left hemisphere is unaware of, e.g. by providing the instructions within the visual field that is only accessible to the right brain. The left-brain interpreter will nonetheless construct a contrived explanation for the action, unaware of the instruction the right brain had received.&lt;ref name="Emotions' page 44"/&gt;

The typical fMRI experiments have a "block mode", in which specific behavioral tasks are arranged into blocks and are performed over a period of time. The fMRI responses from the blocks are then compared.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga213 &gt;''The cognitive neuroscience of mind: a tribute to Michael S. Gazzaniga'' edited by Patricia A. Reuter-Lorenz, Kathleen Baynes, George R. Mangun, and Elizabeth A. Phelps; The MIT Press; 2010; {{ISBN|0-262-01401-7}}; pages 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; In fMRI studies by Koutstaal the level of sensitivity of the right visual cortex with respect to the single exposure of an object (e.g. a table) on two occasions was measured against the display of two distinct tables at once. This contrasted with the left hemisphere's lower level of sensitivity to variations.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt;

Although the concept of the left-brain interpreter was initially based on experiments on patients with split brains, it has since been shown to apply to the everyday behavior of people at large.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga /&gt;

A hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex has been developed in which different regions are categorized according to different "levels" of explanation. The left [[orbitofrontal cortex#Medial and lateral distinction|lateral orbitofrontal cortex]] and [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]] generate causal inferences and explanations of events, which are then evaluated by the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]. The subjective evaluation of different internally generated explanations is then performed by the [[brodmann area 10|anterolateral prefrontal cortex]].

==Reconciling the past with the present==
The drive to seek explanations and provide interpretations is a general human trait, and the left-brain interpreter can be seen as the glue that attempts to hold the story together, in order to provide a sense of coherence to the mind.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga /&gt; In reconciling the past and the present, the left-brain interpreter may confer a sense of comfort to a person, by providing a feeling of consistency and continuity in the world. This may in turn produce feelings of security that the person knows how "things will turn out" in the future.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt;

However, the facile explanations provided by the left-brain interpreter may also enhance the opinion of a person about themselves and produce strong biases which prevent the person from seeing themselves in the light of reality and repeating patterns of behavior which led to past failures.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt; The explanations generated by the left-brain interpreter may be balanced  by right brain systems which follow the constraints of reality to a closer degree.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazza1192 &gt;''The cognitive neurosciences'' by Michael S. Gazzaniga 2004 {{ISBN|0-262-07254-8}} pages 1192-1193&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of the right hemisphere by [[electroconvulsive therapy]] leaves patients inclined to accept conclusions that are absurd but based on strictly-true logic. After electroconsulsive therapy to the left hemisphere the same absurd conclusions are indignantly rejected.&lt;ref name="Deglin, V. L., and Marcel Kinsbourne. 1996"&gt;Deglin, V. L., &amp; Kinsbourne, M. (1996). Divergent thinking styles of the hemispheres: How syllogisms are solved during transitory hemisphere suppression. Brain and cognition, 31(3), 285-307.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The checks and balances provided by the right brain hemisphere may thus avoid scenarios that eventually lead to delusion via the continued construction of biased explanations.&lt;ref name=Daniel /&gt; In 2002 Gazzaniga stated that the three decades of research in the field had taught him that the left hemisphere is far more inventive in interpreting facts than the right hemisphere's more truthful, literal approach to information management.&lt;ref name=GazzanigaAmerican /&gt;

Studies on the neurological basis of different defense mechanisms have revealed that the use of immature defense mechanisms, such as denial, projection, and fantasy, is tied to glucose metabolization in the left prefrontal cortex, while more mature defense mechanisms, such as intellectualization, reaction formation, compensation, and isolation, are associated with glucose metabolization in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Northoff, G. 2010"&gt;Northoff, G. (2010). Region-based approach versus mechanism-based approach to the brain. Neuropsychoanalysis: An Interdisciplinary Journal for Psychoanalysis and the Neurosciences, 12(2), 167-170.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that grey matter volume of the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex correlates with scores on measures of Machiavellian intelligence, while volume of the right medial orbitofrontal cortex correlates with scores on measures of social comprehension and declarative episodic memory.&lt;ref name="Nestor, Paul G., et al. 2013"&gt;Nestor, P. G., Nakamura, M., Niznikiewicz, M., Thompson, E., Levitt, J. J., Choate, V., ... &amp; McCarley, R. W. (2013). In search of the functional neuroanatomy of sociality: MRI subdivisions of orbital frontal cortex and social cognition. Social cognitive and affective neuroscience, 8(4), 460-467.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies illustrate the role of the left prefrontal cortex in exerting control over one's environment in contrast to the role of the right prefrontal cortex in inhibition and self-evaluation.

==Further development and similar models==
	
Michael Gazzaniga, while working on the model of left-brain interpreter, came to the conclusion that simple right-brain/left-brain model of the mind is a gross oversimplification and the brain is organized into hundreds maybe even thousands of modular-processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gazzaniga |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael S. Gazzaniga |last2=LeDoux |first2=Joseph |authorlink2=Joseph E. LeDoux |date=1978 |title=The Integrated Mind |pages=132-161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gazzaniga |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael S. Gazzaniga |date=1985 |title=The Social Brain. Discovering the Networks of the Mind |pages=77-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar models (which also claim that mind is formed from many little agents, i.e. the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by:
* Thomas R. Blakeslee described the brain model similar to Michael Gazzaniga’s. Thomas R. Blakeslee renamed Michael Gazzaniga’s ''interpreter module'' into the ''self module''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blakeslee |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas R. Blakeslee |date=1996 |title=Beyond the Conscious Mind. Unlocking the Secrets of the Self |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neurocluster Brain Model describes the brain as a massively parallel computing machine in which huge number of neuroclusters process information independently from each other. The neurocluster which most of the time has the access to [[Actuator|actuators]] (i.e. neurocluster which most of the time acts upon an environment using actuators) is called the ''main personality''. The term ''main personality'' is equivalent to Michael Gazzaniga’s term ''interpreter module''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neuroclusterbrain.com |title=Official Neurocluster Brain Model site |access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michio Kaku]] described the brain model similar to Michael Gazzaniga’s using the analogy of ''large corporation'' in which Michael Gazzaniga’s ''interpreter module'' is equivalent to ''CEO of large corporation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaku |first=Michio |authorlink=Michio Kaku |date=2014 |title=[[The Future of the Mind]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marvin Minsky|Marvin Minsky’s]] “[[Society of Mind]]” model claims that mind is built up from the interactions of simple parts called ''agents'', which are themselves mindless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Society of Mind|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-60740-5|pages=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert E. Ornstein]] claimed that ''the mind is a squadron of simpletons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ornstein |first= Robert |authorlink= Robert Ornstein |date=1992 |title=Evolution of Consciousness: The Origins of the Way We Think |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ernest Hilgard]] described neodissociationist theory which claims that a “hidden observer” is created in the mind while hypnosis is taking place and this “hidden observer” has his own separate consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilgard|first=Ernest|title=Divided consciousness: multiple controls in human thought and action.|authorlink=Ernest Ropiequet "Jack" Hilgard|date=1977|publisher= Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-39602-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilgard|first=Ernest|title=Divided consciousness: multiple controls in human thought and action (expanded edition).|authorlink=Ernest Ropiequet "Jack" Hilgard|date=1986|publisher= Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-80572-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Ivanovich Gurdjieff in year 1915 taught his students that ''man has no single, big I; man is divided into a multiplicity of small I’s''. George Ivanovich Gurdjieff described the model similar to Michael Gazzaniga’s using the analogy in which the man is compared to a ''house which has a multitude of servants'' and Michael Gazzaniga’s ''interpreter module'' is equivalent to ''master of the servants''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouspenskii |first= Pyotr |authorlink=Pyotr Demianovich Ouspenskii |date=1992 |title=In Search of the Miraculous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14524">In mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]], the '''linear complementarity problem (LCP)''' arises frequently in [[computational mechanics]] and encompasses the well-known [[quadratic programming]] as a special case.  It was proposed by Cottle and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]] {{nowrap|in&amp;nbsp;1968.&lt;ref name="Murty88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Cottle and [[G. B. Dantzig]]. Complementary pivot theory of mathematical programming. ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'', 1:103-125, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Formulation ==
Given a real matrix ''M'' and vector ''q'', the linear complementarity problem LCP(''M'', ''q'') seeks vectors ''z'' and ''w'' which satisfy the following constraints:

* &lt;math&gt;w, z \geqslant 0,&lt;/math&gt; (that is, each component of these two vectors is non-negative)
* &lt;math&gt;z^Tw = 0&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_i w_i z_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt; This is the [[Complementarity theory|complementarity]] condition, since it implies that, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, at most one of &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; can be positive.
* &lt;math&gt;w = Mz + q&lt;/math&gt;

A sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem is that ''M'' be [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[Q-matrix]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a unique solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[P-matrix]]. Both of these characterizations are sufficient and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murty|first1=Katta G.|title=On the number of solutions to the complementarity problem and spanning properties of complementary cones|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|date=January 1972|volume=5|issue=1|pages=65–108|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(72)90019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vector ''w'' is a [[slack variable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Convex Optimization of Power Systems|first=Joshua Adam|last=Taylor|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015| isbn=9781107076877|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBdoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and so is generally discarded after ''z'' is found. As such, the problem can also be formulated as:

* &lt;math&gt;Mz+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z^{\mathrm{T}}(Mz+q) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (the complementarity condition)

==Convex quadratic-minimization: Minimum conditions==
Finding a solution to the linear complementarity problem is associated with minimizing the quadratic function

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^T(Mz+q)&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the constraints

: &lt;math&gt;{Mz}+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;

These constraints ensure that ''f'' is always non-negative. The minimum of ''f'' is 0 at ''z'' if and only if ''z'' solves the linear complementarity problem.

If ''M'' is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], any algorithm for solving (strictly) convex [[Quadratic programming|QPs]] can solve the LCP.  Specially designed basis-exchange pivoting algorithms, such as [[Lemke's algorithm]] and a variant of the [[simplex algorithm|simplex algorithm of Dantzig]] have been used for decades. Besides having polynomial time complexity, interior-point methods are also effective in practice.

Also, a quadratic-programming problem stated as minimize &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c^Tx+\tfrac{1}{2} x^T Qx&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;Ax \geqslant b&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;x \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; with ''Q'' symmetric

is the same as solving the LCP with

:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ -b \end{bmatrix}, \qquad M = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; -A^T \\ A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker]] conditions of the QP problem can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} 
v = Q x - A^T {\lambda} + c \\ 
s = A x - b \\ 
x, {\lambda}, v, s \geqslant 0 \\ 
x^{T} v+ {\lambda}^T s = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''v'' the Lagrange multipliers on the non-negativity constraints, ''λ'' the &lt;!-- Lagrange  --&gt;multipliers on the inequality constraints, and ''s'' the slack variables for the inequality constraints. The fourth condition derives from the complementarity of each group of variables {{math|(''x'', ''s'')}} with its set of KKT vectors (optimal Lagrange multipliers) being {{math|(''v'', ''λ'')}}. In that case,

: &lt;math&gt;z = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \lambda \end{bmatrix}, \qquad w = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ s \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the non-negativity constraint on the ''x'' is relaxed, the dimensionality of the LCP problem can be reduced to the number of the inequalities, as long as ''Q'' is non-singular (which is guaranteed if it is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]). The multipliers ''v'' are no longer present, and the first KKT conditions can be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;Q x = A^{T} {\lambda} - c&lt;/math&gt;

or:

: &lt;math&gt; x = Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c)&lt;/math&gt;

pre-multiplying the two sides by ''A'' and subtracting ''b'' we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt; A x - b = A Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c) -b \,&lt;/math&gt;

The left side, due to the second KKT condition, is ''s''. Substituting and reordering:

: &lt;math&gt; s = (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) {\lambda} + (- A Q^{-1} c - b )\,&lt;/math&gt;

Calling now

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) \\
Q &amp;:=  (- A Q^{-1} c - b)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

we have an LCP, due to the relation of complementarity between the slack variables ''s'' and their Lagrange multipliers ''λ''. Once we solve it, we may obtain the value of ''x'' from ''λ''  through the first KKT condition.

Finally, it is also possible to handle additional equality constraints:

: &lt;math&gt;A_{eq}x = b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;

This introduces a vector of Lagrange multipliers ''μ'', with the same dimension as &lt;math&gt;b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to verify that the ''M'' and ''Q'' for the LCP system &lt;math&gt; s = M {\lambda} + Q&lt;/math&gt; are now expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}  \begin{bmatrix} A^T \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  \\
Q &amp;:= - \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ b_{eq} \end{bmatrix} - b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From ''λ'' we can now recover the values of both ''x'' and the Lagrange multiplier of equalities ''μ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ \mu \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} A^T \lambda - c \\ -b_{eq} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, most QP solvers work on the LCP formulation, including the [[interior point method]], principal / complementarity pivoting, and [[active set]] methods.&lt;ref name="Murty88"&gt;{{harvtxt|Murty|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"&gt;{{harvtxt|Cottle|Pang|Stone|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCP problems can be solved also by the [[criss-cross algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Terlaky|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRT"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D. |last1=den&amp;nbsp;Hertog |first2=C.| last2=Roos |first3=T. |last3=Terlaky|title=The linear complementarity problem, sufficient matrices, and the criss-cross method|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|volume=187|date=1 July 1993|pages=1–14|url=http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6714737.pdf|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(93)90124-7|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zsolt |last1=Csizmadia |first2=Tibor |last2=Illés|title=New criss-cross type algorithms for linear complementarity problems with sufficient matrices|journal=Optimization Methods and Software| volume=21 |year=2006 |number=2 |pages=247–266|doi=10.1080/10556780500095009|url=http://www.cs.elte.hu/opres/orr/download/ORR03_1.pdf|format=pdf|&lt;!-- ref=harv --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, for linear complementarity problems, the criss-cross algorithm terminates finitely only if the matrix is a sufficient matrix.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt; A [[sufficient&amp;nbsp;matrix]] is a generalization both of a [[positive-definite matrix]] and of a [[P-matrix]], whose [[principal&amp;nbsp;minor]]s are each positive.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cottle | first1=R.&amp;nbsp;W. |authorlink1=Richard W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6887">{{short description|The process by which heavier members of a gravitationally bound system tend to move toward the center, while lighter members tend to move away from the center}}
[[File:Messier 30 Hubble WikiSky.jpg|thumb|266x266px|Many [[globular cluster]]s, such as the 13-Gyr old cluster [[Messier 30|M30]] (pictured), are mass segregated.]]

In [[astronomy]], '''dynamical mass segregation''' is the process by which heavier members of a gravitationally bound system, such as a [[star cluster]] or [[Galaxy groups and clusters|cluster of galaxies]], tend to move toward the center, while lighter members tend to move farther away from the center.

== Equipartition of kinetic energy ==
During a close encounter of two members of the cluster, the members exchange both [[energy]] and [[momentum]].  Although energy can be exchanged in either direction, there is a statistical tendency for the [[kinetic energy]] of the two members to equalize during an encounter; this statistical phenomenon is called [[equipartition of energy|equipartition]], and is similar to the fact that the expected kinetic  energy of the molecules of a gas are all the same at a given temperature.

Since kinetic energy is proportional to mass times the square of the speed, equipartition requires the less massive members of a cluster to be moving faster.  The more massive members will thus tend to sink into lower orbits (that is, orbits closer to the center of the cluster), while the less massive members will tend to rise to higher orbits.

The time it takes for the kinetic energies of the cluster members to roughly equalize is called the [[relaxation time]] of the cluster. A relaxation time-scale assuming energy is exchanged through two-body interactions was approximated in the textbook by Binney &amp; Tremaine as
:&lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{relax}=\frac {N}{8\ln N}\times t_\mathrm{cross} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of stars in the cluster and &lt;math&gt; t_\mathrm{cross}&lt;/math&gt; is the typical time it takes for a star to cross the cluster. This is on the order of 100 million years for a typical [[globular cluster]] with radius 10 [[parsec]]s consisting of 100 thousand stars. The most massive stars in a cluster can segregate more rapidly than the less massive stars. This time-scale can be approximated using a toy model developed by [[Lyman Spitzer]] of a cluster where stars only have two possible masses (&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;). In this case, the more massive stars (mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;) will segregate in the time
:&lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{m_1}=\frac {m_2}{m_1}\times t_\mathrm{relax} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Outward segregation of [[white dwarfs]] was observed in the globular cluster [[47 Tucanae]] in a [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] study of the region.&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily-2015-05-18&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Hubble_Catches_Stellar_Exodus_in_Action_999.html |title= Hubble Catches Stellar Exodus in Action |date= 18 May 2015 |publisher= Space Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primordial mass segregation ==

[[File:W40 star-forming region.jpg|thumb|Mass segregation is occasionally seen in clusters in [[star formation|star-forming regions]] like [[Westerhout 40|W40]] (pictured).&lt;ref name=kuhn10&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kuhn | first = M. A. | display-authors = etal | year=2010 | title = A Chandra Observation of the Obscured Star-forming Complex W40 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 725 | issue=2 | pages = 2485–2506 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/725/2/2485 | bibcode=2010ApJ...725.2485K|arxiv = 1010.5434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Primordial mass segregation''' is non-uniform distribution of masses present at the formation of a cluster.  The argument that a star cluster is primordially mass segregated is typically based on a comparison of [[Virial theorem|virialization]] timescales and the cluster's age. However, several dynamical mechanisms to accelerate virialization compared to two-body interactions have been examined.&lt;ref name=mcmillan07&gt;{{Cite journal| last = McMillan | first = S. L. | display-authors = etal | year=2007 | title = A Dynamical Origin for Early Mass Segregation in Young Star Clusters | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 655 | issue=1 | pages = L45-L49 | doi=10.1086/511763 | bibcode=2007ApJ...655L..45M|arxiv = astro-ph/0609515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In star-forming regions, it is often observed that [[O-type star]]s are preferentially located in the center of a young cluster.

== Evaporation ==
After relaxation, the speed of some low mass members can be greater than the [[escape velocity]] of the cluster, which results in these members being lost to the cluster.  This process is called '''evaporation'''.  (A similar phenomenon explains the loss of lighter gases from a planet, such as hydrogen and helium from the Earth—after equipartition, some molecules of sufficiently light gases at the top of the atmosphere will exceed the escape velocity of the planet and be lost.)

Through evaporation, most [[open cluster]]s eventually dissipate, as indicated by the fact that most existing open clusters are quite young.  [[Globular cluster]]s, being more tightly bound, appear to be more durable.

== In the Galaxy ==
The relaxation time of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy is approximately 10 trillion years, on the order of thousand times the age of the galaxy itself.  Thus, any observed mass segregation in our galaxy must be almost entirely primordial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

'''Nanotechnology education''' involves a multidisciplinary [[natural science]] education with courses such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin E. Sweeney (2008) Developing a viable knowledge base in nanoscale science and engineering, ''Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education'' (eds. A. E. Sweeney and S. Seal, American Scientific, Stevenson Ranch CA) pp. 1-35, {{ISBN|978-1588830852}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being offered by many [[University|universities]] around the world. The first program involving [[nanotechnology]] was offered by the [[University of Toronto]]'s Engineering Science program, where nanotechnology could be taken as an option.

Here is a partial list of universities offering nanotechnology education, and the degrees offered ([[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], and/or [[Ph.D]] in Nanotechnology).

==Nanotechnology in Schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the [[high school]] level. 
In the [[United States]], although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:

* The [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teacher Association]], which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher’s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* [http://www.nano-link.org Nano-Link], a notable program of the [[Dakota County Technical College]], which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* [http://www.omninano.org Omni Nano], which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog.
* [http://www.nano4me.org/ Nano4Me], which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]], which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107041954/http://www.in2nano.sabrycorp.com/ in2nano] is a high school outreach program aiming to increase [[scientific literacy]] and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]] has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at [http://www.nisenet.org www.nisenet.org] and a site for the public at [http://www.whatisnano.org www.whatisnano.org]. The NISE Network also organizes [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network#NanoDays|Nano Days]], a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

'''Nutrition Education''' is any combination of educational strategies, accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food choices and other food- and nutrition-related behaviors conducive to health and well-being. Nutrition education is delivered through multiple venues and involves activities at the individual, community, and policy levels.&lt;ref&gt;Nutrition education: Linking research, theory and practice. Jones &amp; Bartlett, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page number needed|date=July 2017}}

The work of nutrition educators takes place in colleges, universities and schools, government agencies, [[Cooperative extension service|cooperative extension]], communications and public relations firms, the food industry, voluntary and service organizations and with other reliable places of nutrition and health education information. Nutrition education is a mechanism to enhance awareness,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} as a means to self-efficacy, surrounding the trigger of healthy behaviors&lt;ref&gt;Ronda G, Van Assema P, Brug J. Stages of change, psychological factors and awareness of physical activity levels in The Netherlands. Health Promot Int. 2001;16(4):305-314&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of government agencies that incorporate nutrition education into their programs, include:
* [[Let's Move]], launched by First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] in February 2010, through the [http://www.letsmove.gov/healthierschoolfood.php Healthier US School Challenge];
* USDA [[Food and Nutrition Service]], which provides nutrition education materials to children and adults of all ages and nutrition education to [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) participants and applicants;
* [[National Institute of Food and Agriculture|USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture]] through the [http://www.nifa.usda.gov/qlinks/extension.html cooperative extension program]; and
* [[MyPyramid|MyPyramid.gov]], through the [http://www.mypyramid.gov/tips_resources/tentips.html Ten Tips Nutrition Education Series].

Examples of technological innovations by private enterprise include:
*''' [[fooya]]''' a [[mHealth|mobile health]] [[Mobile app|App]] by [[FriendsLearn]] is designed for children, to improve their awareness about healthy eating, while reinforcing the role of physical activity on health. It has been shown to have positive health outcomes through underlying methods of [[Neuropsychology]], [[Health Coaching]] and [[Cognitive Behavior Therapy]], as observed during randomized and controlled clinical trials conducted by researchers at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] Children's Nutrition Research Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicinex.stanford.edu/conf/submission/view/343|author=[[Stanford]] MedicineX|date=6 July 2015|title=Neuropsychology based Behavior Design through Mobile Health Gaming|publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2014.obesityweek.com/wp/uploads/2014/10/TOS-Posters.pdf|publisher=[[The Obesity Society]]|author=Dr Craig Johnston, Dr Jennette Moreno, et al [[Baylor College of Medicine]]|title=A Nutrition Education Mobile Game Impacts Snack Selection in Middle School Students|date=2 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060846/http://2014.obesityweek.com/wp/uploads/2014/10/TOS-Posters.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==
The three core tenets of permaculture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Greenblott | first1 = Kara | first2 = Kristof | last2 = Nordin | year = 2012 | title = Permaculture Design for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming: Low-Cost, Sustainable Solutions for Food and Nutrition Insecure Communities | place = Arlington, VA | publisher = USAID | series = AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR-One | number = Task Order 1 | url = http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mollison | 1988 | p =2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: Principles &amp; Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn = 0-646-41844-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.  See Dave Jacke's work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds, specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Guilds | accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | publisher = The Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi= 10.1098/rspb.1998.0336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge effect===
The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10. Edge Effect|date=3 April 2013|newspaper=Deep Green Permaculture|language=en-US|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark.

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked. [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Joel Salatin]] have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start [[ecological succession]] or prepare ground for planting. [[Allan Savory]]'s [[holistic management]] technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to [[rangeland management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last= Fairlie | publisher= Chelsea Green | year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-60358325-1 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris| url= http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404| work= The Sunday Times | date =  4 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ash|first=Andrew|others=et al.|title=The Ecograze Project – developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|isbn=0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=7 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052228/http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url= http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title | work = CNET | accessdate =7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081104/http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Littman|first= Margaret|title= Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners |work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title= Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/ |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title= Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm | year = 1988 | title = Public Service | type = biography | contribution = Masanobu Fukuoka | publisher = The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation | place = [[The Philippines|PH]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Permaculture Action'''&lt;/big&gt;

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming. The action of permaculture looks and all becoming consciously involved in the process of producing and ensuring abundant food nearby, problem on malnutrition caused by the world hunger problem will inevitably lessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasarinlan|first=|year=2011|title=Permaculture as Alternative Agriculture|url=http://www.journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/kasarinlan/article/viewFile/3511/pdf_149|journal=Philippine|volume=26|pages=422–434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture principles in action are powerful forces to help right the environmental wrongs of the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solscape.co.nz/permaculture-sustainability/|title=Permaculture and Sustainability - Solscape|work=Solscape|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39485">'''Proletarian literature''' refers here to the literature created by [[working-class]] writers mainly for the [[class-consciousness|class-conscious]] [[proletariat]]. Though the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that because it "is essentially an intended device of revolution", it is therefore often published by the [[Communist Party]] or left wing sympathizers,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; the proletarian novel has also been categorized without any emphasis on revolution, as a novel "about the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism''. (London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; This different emphasis may reflect a difference between Russian, American and other traditions of working-class writing, with that of Britain. The British tradition was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the [[Chartist movement]], and [[socialism]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hayward, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to ''Trainspotting''. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, writing about the British working-class writers, H Gustav Klaus, in ''The Socialist Novel: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition'' (1982) suggested that "the once current [term] 'proletarian' is, internationally, on the retreat, while the competing concepts of 'working-class' and 'socialist' continue to command about equal adherence".&lt;ref&gt;Brighton: Harvest Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word proletarian is also used to describe works about the working class by working-class authors, to distinguish them from works by middle-class authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] (''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''), and [[Henry Green]] (''[[Living (novel)|Living]]'').&lt;ref name="Fordham-p71"&gt;John Fordham, "'A Strange Field’: Region and Class in the Novels of Harold Heslop" in ''Intermodernism: Literary Culture in Mid-Twentieth-Century Britain'', ed. Kristin Bluemel. Published 2009 :Edinburgh University Press, note no.1, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, though some of poet [[William Blake]]'s (1757–1827) works are early examples of working-class literature, including the two "The Chimney Sweeper" poems, published in ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' in 1789 and ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' in 1794, which deal with the subject of child labour,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities/britlit/97-98/blake/POEMS.htm William Blake Page]", The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, &amp; the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, whose father was a tradesman, was not a proletarian writer.

==Proletarian novel==
The [[proletariat]] are members of the [[working class]]. The proletarian novel is a subgenre of the [[novel]], written by workers mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus, ''The Socialist Novel in Britain: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition''. ( Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; socialist novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social problem novel]] (also problem novel or sociological novel or [[social novel]]),&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), p.487; "social problem novel." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 02 Nov. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/664323/social-problem-novel]&lt;/ref&gt; propaganda or thesis novel,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon (revised C. E. Preston), ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory''. (London: Penguin, 1999), pp. 704, 913&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socialist realism]] novel.

The proletarian novel may [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by [[communist]], [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] authors. It is about the lives of poor, and the period 1930 to 1945 in particular produced many such novels. However, there were works before and after these dates. In Britain the term [[working class]] literature, novel ''etc''. is more generally used. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums, by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or a political revolution. As such it is a form of [[political fiction]].

==United States==
The most important American working-class writers gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 1935. The [[League of American Writers]] was backed by the [[Communist Party USA]]. Among the famous international writers who attended the Congress were Georg Fink (pseudonym of the German writer [[:de:Kurt Münzer|Kurt Münzer]]), [[Mike Gold]] of New York (both of whom were Jewish), [[José Revueltas]] of Mexico,  [[:es:Nicomedes Guzmán|Nicomedes Guzmán]] of Chile, [[Jorge Icaza Coronel|Jorge Icaza]] of Ecuador, and numerous others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the United States, [[Mike Gold]], author of  ''[[Jews Without Money]]'', was the first to promote proletarian literature in [[Max Eastman]]'s magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' and later in ''[[The New Masses]]''. The Communist party newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' also published some literature, as did numerous other magazines, including ''The Anvil'', edited by [[Jack Conroy]], ''Blast'', and ''[[Partisan Review]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Other examples of American proletarian writing include [[B. Traven]], ''[[The Death Ship]]'' (1926) (though it is presumed that Traven was born in Germany); [[Agnes Smedley]], ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' (1929); [[Edward Dahlberg]], ''Bottom Dogs'' (1929);  [[Jack Conroy]], ''[[The Disinherited]]'' (1933); [[James T. Farrell]], ''[[Studs Lonigan]]'' (a trilogy, 1932-5); [[Robert Cantwell]], ''The Land of Plenty'' (1934); [[Henry Roth]], ''[[Call It Sleep]]'' (1934); [[Meridel Le Sueur]], ''Salute to Spring'' (1940) and [[Tillie Olsen]], ''[[Yonnondio: From the Thirties|Yonnondio]]'' (1930s, published 1974).

Writers like [[John Steinbeck]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[John Dos Passos]], who wrote about the working class, but who came from more well-to-do backgrounds, are not included here.

==Soviet Russia==
An important movement In the first years of the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Proletkult]], was an effort to encourage literacy. This was something quite different from the later, traditional and realist proletarian novel of the [[Stalin]] years.

In the 1930s [[Socialist realism]] became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figure was [[Maxim Gorky]], who had laid the foundations of this style with his works ''[[The Mother (1906 novel)|The Mother]]'' and his play ''The Enemies'' (both 1906). Gorky described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalization.&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |title=Maxim Gorky |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706084924/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not come from a working-class family and neither did another prominent writer in the early years after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, [[Alexander Ostrovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maxim Gorky", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maksim-Gorky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revyakin&lt; A.I. A.N. Ostrovsky. Life and Works. Moscow, 1949, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Nikolay Ostrovsky]] is an important writer, of the early Soviet era, from a working-class family. His novel ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' (1932) has been among the most successful works of [[Russian literature]], with tens of millions of copies printed in many languages around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2008/e200804/p28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="compuart"&gt;http://www.compuart.ru/article.aspx?id=8496&amp;iid=346&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a fictionalized autobiography of Ostrovsky's life, who had a difficult working-class childhood and became a [[Komsomol]] member in July 1919 and went to the front as a volunteer. The novel's protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, represented the "young hero" of Russian literature: he is dedicated to his political causes, which help him to overcome his tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet literature: problems and people K. Zelinsky, Progress Publishers. Moscow. 1970. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Leonov]]  (1899 — 1994) was a Soviet novelist and playwright. His novel ''The Russian Forest'' (1953) was acclaimed by the authorities as a model Soviet book on [[World War II]] and received the [[Lenin Prize]], but its implication that the Soviet regime had cut down "the symbol of Old Russian culture" caused some nervousness, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reminded the author that "not all trees are useful ... from time to time the forest must be thinned."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture'' (Knopf, 1966), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==

===19th century===
[[Image:Tressell.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Tressell banner]]
Poet [[John Clare]] (1793–1864) was an important early British working-class writer. Clare was the son of a farm labourer, and came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to ''John Clare: Selected Poems'', Penguin Books 1990, pp 13–22.  {{ISBN|0-14-043724-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, Roger  (2002) ''John Clare: A Literary Life''; Palgrave Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-65270-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bate, John Clare: A biography; Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] example of a working-class novel is [[Chartism|chartist]] Thomas Martin Wheeler's ''Sunshine and Shadows'', which was serialized in the ''Northern Star'' 1849-50.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to 'Trainspotting' ''. (Plymouth: Nortcote House, 1997), p7&lt;/ref&gt; Another chartist writer was the shoemaker poet [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]], who, while in prison for making an inflammatory speech, "followed in the footsteps of [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]] and other radicals and wrote imaginatively about the themes of oppression and emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[Walter Greenwood]]'s ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (1933) has been described as an "excellent example" of an English proletarian novel.&lt;ref&gt;J. A Cuddon, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, the industrial slum in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] where Greenwood was born and brought up. The story begins around the time of the [[General Strike]] of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931.

Several working-class writers  wrote about their experience of life in the [[merchant navy]], including  [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], [[Jim Phelan (Irish writer)|Jim Phelan]], [[George Garrett (activist)|George Garrett]], and [[John Sommerfield]]. Liverpool-Irish writer James Hanley wrote a number of works based on his experiences at sea as well as a member of a working-class seafaring family. An early example is the novella ''The Last Voyage'' (1931), in which stoker John Reilly, who is still working only because he lied about his age, now faces his last voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reilly is in his mid-sixties he has a young family, who will have to live in future on his inadequate pension.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing of the future he throws himself into the ship’s furnace: “Saw all his life illuminated in those flames. ‘Not much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!’”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Binding, "Man Against Fate", a review of James Hanley's ''Last Voyage and Other Stories''. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 5 December 1997, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Voyage and Other Stories'' (London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other works by Hanley are ''[[Boy (novel)|Boy]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Furys Chronicle|The Furys]]'' (1935).

There were a number of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writers who wrote works based on their experiences as coal miners, including novelist (and playwright) [[Jack Jones (novelist)|Jack Jones]] (1884–1970), novelists [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–1981). [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]] (1897–1939), and [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999), and poet [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53). Jack Jones was a miner's son from [[Merthyr Tydfil]] who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the [[CPGB|Communist Party]], but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are ''[[Rhondda Roundabout]]'' (1935) and ''Bidden to the Feast'' (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of ''Cwmardy'' (1937), [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]]'s (1897–1939) largely autobiographical novel. [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–81) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the [[Rhondda Valley]] in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, ''Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh'', which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including ''Times Like These'' (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 miners' strike]]. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh "but rebellion against chapel religion", along with the "inspirational influence of English" poets, led him to write in English. ''Gwalia Deserta'' (1938) is about the [[Great Depression]], while the subject of ''The Angry Summer'' (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], author of ''A Time To Laugh'' (1937), and [[Menna Gallie]], author of ''Strike for a Kingdom'' (1959) and ''The Small Mine'' (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of [[South Wales]]. [[Harold Heslop]], author of the novel ''The Earth Beneath'' (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of [[England]], as was [[Sid Chaplin]], who wrote ''The Thin Seam'' (1949).

Both [[Alan Sillitoe]], ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (1958) and [[Stan Barstow]], ''[[A Kind of Loving]]'' (1960), were working class writers associated with the so-called [[Angry young men]]; they were also linked with [[Kitchen sink realism]], a literary movement that used a style of social realism. This often depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies. However, some of the writers also associated with these two movements, like [[John Osborne]] and [[John Braine]], did not come from the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilpern|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Braine "John Braine", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' ;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some other important twentieth-century British working class novelists and novels: [[Robert Tressell]], ''[[The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists]]'' (1914); [[James C. Welsh]], ''The Underworld'' (1920); [[Ethel Carnie Holdsworth]], ''This Slavery'' (1925); [[Ellen Wilkinson]], ''[[Clash (novel)|Clash]]'' (1929);  [[Lewis Grassic Gibbon]] ''[[A Scots Quair]]'' (trilogy, 1932-4); [[Barry Hines]], ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' (1968); [[William McIlvanney]], ''[[Docherty (novel)|Docherty]]'' (1975); [[Pat Barker]], ''[[Union Street (book)|Union Street]]'' (1982); [[James Kelman]], ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'' (1984); [[Irvine Welsh]], ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 170–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Bond]] is an important working-class dramatist and his play ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965) became one of the best known [[cause célèbre]]s in 20th century British theatre history. ''Saved'' delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed – as Bond would see it – by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Saved'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
Two leading French writers who were born into the working class were [[Jean Giono]] (1895–1970) and [[Henry Poulaille]] (1896–1980).

[[Jean Giono]] was the son of a cobbler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daudin|first1=Claire|title=Jean Giono, "Colline"|date=1999|publisher=Bréal|location=Rosny|page=17|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=-d-pH8ZRQIoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  a laundry woman, who spent most of his life in [[Manosque]], [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]. He was a voracious reader but had to leave school at sixteen to work in a bank to help support his family. He published his first novel ''Colline'' in 1929, which won him the [[Prix Brentano]] and $1000, and an English translation of the book,&lt;ref name=fay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=Eliot G.|year=1930|title=Prix Brentano|journal=[[The French Review]]|volume=3|issue=3|pages=169–73|jstor=380090}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="alalettre1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alalettre.com/giono-bio.php |title=Jean Giono (Biographie) |publisher=aLaLettre |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties are set in [[Provence]], with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref name="infinit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.infinit.net/poibru/giono/gionobib.htm |title=Jean Giono: bibliographie |publisher=Pages.infinit.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Pagnol]] based three of his films on Giono's work of this period: ''Regain'', with [[Fernandel]] and music by [[Honegger]], ''Angèle'', and ''La Femme du boulanger'', with [[Raimu]].&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

After World War II he planned on writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by [[Balzac]]’s [[La Comédie humaine]], in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family a hundred years apart. But Giono only completed the four Hussard novels, ''Mort d’un personnage'' (1948)), ''Le Hussard sur le Toit'' (1951), ''Le Bonheur fou'' (1957),  ''Angelo'' (1958).&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

[[Henry Poulaille]] was the son of a carpenter and cane worker, who was orphaned at fourteen. In addition to writing novels Poulaille was active in encouraging working class writing in France from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Burin André and Jean Rousselot, ''Dictionary of Contemporary French Literature''.

==Korea==
{{main|Korean_literature#Modern_literature|date=April 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Korea was initially driven by the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 and the state of conditions that followed within the country.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proletarian literature acted as a movement that attempted to unify Korea against the shift into imperialism and capitalism that was brought forth by colonial Japan and its government that occupied Korea from the point of annexation until the end of World War II in 1945.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt; The Korean proletarian literature movement became most prominent in the late 1920s and early 1930s, with the formation of multiple social and cultural groups that created, discussed, and revolved around proletarian arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Important Dates in China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan in Proletarian Art |publisher=Duke University Press | author= Author, Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt;

Works of Korean proletarian literature written before 1927 revolved around reconstructing and reforming social issues. One such example would be the short story "Starvation and Slaughter" ("Kia wa Saryuk", 1925) by author Ch'oe Sŏ-hae, which detailed problems like discrimination between the wealthy and the poor classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korea Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=415–416|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1927, Korean proletarian literature started to revolve around ideas that involved intellectuals rather than focus on the struggles between the rich and poor. Examples of these works include ''The Peasant Cho˘ng To-ryong'' by Yi Ki-yo˘ng, ''A Transitional Period'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''Rat Fire'' by So˘hwa, and ''Hometown'' by Kohyang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural movements, especially those of left-wing politics, were fundamental in driving the proletarian genre and movement in Korea. Yŏmgunsa, meaning Torch of the Masses, was a group and movement formed in 1922 that was led by the writer [[Song Yŏng]], and built on a focus towards literature pertaining to social issues and class politics. PASKYULA was a group that reacted to and discussed commonplace literature and art, with more of a focus on the cultural aspects of the materials. These groups were two largely important circles in the movement of unification that represented the mix of proletarian and bourgeois ideals that initially propelled the genre of proletarian literature in Japan-occupied Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Japanese-Korean Exchange within the Proletarian Visual Arts Movement |publisher=Duke University Press |author= Kida, Emiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite we |title=Proletarian Sensibilities: The Body Politics of New Tendency Literature (1924–27) |publisher=Duke University Press  |author= Chung, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of Yŏmgunsa, and a key author in KAPF's circle, Song Yŏng primarily wrote with the intention of forming a solidarity within Korea as well as with Japan through his writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University  |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two works, "Our Love" in 1929, and "Shift Change" in 1930 highlight Yŏng's ideology of unification within his writing, as well as the idea of moving away from cultural nostalgia and an idyllic past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In "Our Love", the process of industrialization and its resulting urban cities are portrayed as locales of potential opportunity rather than iniquitous environments, depicting a contrasting opinion to other works produced within KAPF. This is first shown through Yong-hee, a primary character within the story who eventually leaves the Korean countryside and travels to Tokyo, in pursuit of escaping her hometown's oppressive patriarchal culture and finding unity, independence, and equality in urban Japan's workforce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Set in Japan, "Shift Change" focuses more on the working class movement itself through a group of feuding Korean and Japanese workers. The resolution results in a reconciliation through combined effort, encouraging a combined effort from both the Japanese and Korean proletariat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Proletarian Movement, there was an urge from Japanese colonialists to “convert” Koreans away from communism. This conversion system was called ''cho˘nhyang.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea|last=Namhee|first=Lee|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=0801445663|location=|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cho˘nhyang'' sparked numerous works from various authors such as ''The Mire'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''New Year’s Day'' by Yi Kiyo˘ng, ''A Prospect'' by Paek Ch’o˘l, ''Barley'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, and ''Management'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, all published between the years 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korean Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=418–419|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Japan emerged from a trend in the latter half of the 1910s of literature about working conditions by authors who had experienced them, later called Taisho workers literature. Representative works from this period include Sukeo Miyajima's ''Miners'' (坑夫) and Karoku Miyachi's ''Tomizō the Vagrant'' (放浪者富蔵), as well as works dealing with military experiences which were also associated with the [[Taishō period#Japan after World War I: Taishō Democracy|Taishō democracy]], the emergence of which allowed for the development of proletarian literature in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1921, [[Ōmi Komaki]] and Hirofumi Kaneko founded the literary magazine ''The Sowers'' (種蒔く人), which aimed to reform both the current literary scene and society. ''The Sowers'' attracted attention for recording tragedies that occurred in the wake of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

In 1924, ''Literary Front'' (文芸戦線) magazine was launched by Hatsunosuke Hirabayashi and Suekichi Aono, becoming the main magazine of the Japanese proletarian literature movement. New writing such as [[Yoshiki Hayama]]'s ''The Prostitute'' (淫売婦) and [[Denji Kuroshima]]'s ''A Herd of Pigs'' (豚群) also began to appear in the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1928, the Japanese Proletarian Arts Federation (全日本無産者芸術連盟, Nippona Artista Proleta Federacio, known as '''NAPF''') was founded, bringing together the Japan Proletarian Artists Union (日本プロレタリア芸術連盟), the Labor-Farmers Artists Union (労農芸術家連盟), and the Vanguard Artists Union (前衛芸術家同盟). NAPF was largely the responsibility of two up-and-coming writers called [[Takiji Kobayashi]] and Sunao Tokunaga, and the organization's newsletter ''Battleflag'' (戦旗) published many influential works such as Kobayashi's ''[[Kanikōsen|The Crab Cannery Ship]]'' (蟹工船) and ''March 15, 1928'' (一九二八年三月十五日) and Tokunaga's ''A Street Without Sun'' (太陽のない街). Another important magazine was ''Reconstruction'' (改造) which published writings from [[Ryunosuke Akutagawa]] and [[Yuriko Miyamoto]], who had just returned from the [[Soviet Union]]. Other more renowned publishers like ''Chūo Kōron'' (Central Review), ''Kaizō'' (Reconstruction), and ''Miyako Shinbun'' also published works by proletarian authors, even those who were members of the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recasting Red Culture in Proletarian Japan: Childhood, Korea, and the Historical Avant-Garde|last=Perry|first=Samuel|publisher=University of Hawaii|year=2014|isbn=9780824838935|location=Honolulu|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Korehito Kurehara traveled secretly to the Soviet Union in 1930 for the [[Profintern]] conference, and upon his return in 1931, he started agitating for the democratization of literary organizations. This sparked the drive to organize literary circles in factories and rural areas, creating a new source of readers and writers there.

In 1931, the NAPF became the Union of Japanese Proletarian Cultural Organizations (日本プロレタリア文化連盟, Federacio de Proletaj Kultur Organizoj Japanaj, also known as '''KOPF'''), incorporating other cultural organizations, such as musicians and filmmakers. KOPF produced various magazines including ''Working Woman'' (働く婦人)

The Japanese government cracked down harshly on proletarian authors, as the Japanese Communist Party had been outlawed since its founding in 1922. Though not all authors were associated with the party, the KOPF was, leading to mass arrests such as the [[March 15 incident]]. Some authors, such as Takiji Kobayashi were tortured to death by police, while others were forced to [[Tenkō|renounce their socialist beliefs]].

''[[Kanikōsen]]'' (1929) is a short novel by [[Takiji Kobayashi]] (translated into English as ''The Cannery Boat'' (1933), ''The Factory Ship'' (1973) and ''The Crab Cannery Ship'' (2013)), which depicts the lives of Japanese crab fishermen. Told from a [[left-wing]] point of view, it is concerned with the hardships that the crew face and how they are exploited by the owners. The book has been made into a film and as [[manga]].

==Romania==
[[Panait Istrati]] (1884–1935), was a [[Romania]]n working class writer, the son of the laundress  and of a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[smuggler]].  He studied in primary school for six years in [[Vădeni, Brăila|Baldovinești]], after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an apprentice to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook and peddler. In the meantime, he was a prolific reader.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Dadoun, ''Panait Istrati'', L'Arc, Aix-en-Provence, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Istrati's first attempts at writing date from around 1907 when he started sending pieces to the [[Socialism|socialist]] periodicals in Romania, debuting with the article, ''Hotel Regina'' in ''[[România Muncitoare]]''. Here, he later published his first short stories, ''Mântuitorul'' ("The Redeemer"), ''Calul lui Bălan'' ("Bălan's Horse"), ''Familia noastră'' ("Our Family"), ''1 Mai'' ("[[May Day]]"). He also contributed pieces to other [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] newspapers such as ''Dimineața'', ''[[Adevărul]]'', and ''Viața Socială''. In 1910, he was involved in organizing a strike in Brăila. He went to [[Bucharest]], [[Istanbul]], [[Cairo]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]] (1913–1914), and [[Switzerland]], where he settled for a while, trying to cure his [[tuberculosis]]). Istrati's travels were marked by two successive unhappy marriages, a brief return to Romania in 1915 when he tried to earn his living as a pig farmer, and long periods of vagabondage.&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Raydon, ''Panaït Istrati, vagabond de génie'', Les Éditions Municipales, Paris, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1923 in literature|1923]] Istrati's story ''Kyra Kyralina'' (or ''Chira Chiralina'') was published with a preface by the famous French novelist [[Romaine Rolland]]. It became the first in his ''Adrien Zograffi'' [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]]. Rolland was fascinated with Istrati's adventurous life, urging him to write more and publishing parts of his work in ''Clarté'', the journal that Rolland and [[Henri Barbusse]] ran.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"&gt;Roger Dadoun.&lt;/ref&gt; The next major work by Istrati was the [[novel]] ''Codine''.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14596">In [[fluid dynamics]], a flow with periodic variations is known as '''pulsatile flow''', or as '''Womersley flow'''. The flow profiles was first derived by [[John R. Womersley]] (1907–1958) in his work with blood flow in [[arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Properties ==

=== Womersley number ===
The pulsatile flow profile changes its shape depending on the Womersley number

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \left( \frac{\omega \rho}{\mu} \right)^{1/2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \lesssim 2&lt;/math&gt;, viscous forces dominate the flow, and the pulse is considered [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] with a parabolic profile.
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \gtrsim 2&lt;/math&gt;, the inertial forces are dominant in the central core, whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer. Thus, the velocity profile gets flattened, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core.

=== Function limits ===

==== Lower limit ====

The Bessel function at its lower [[Limit of a function|limit]] becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{4} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille flow]] profile for steady flow for

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to 0} u(r, t) = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

or to a [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] pulse with parabolic profile when

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\alpha \to 0} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \,  e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \, \cos(n \omega t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the function is real, because the pressure and velocity waves are in phase.

==== Upper limit ====

The Bessel function at its upper limit it becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z \, i) = \frac{e^z}{\sqrt{2\pi\, z}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{1/2} \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{\, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2}  \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] \sin(n\,\omega\, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is highly reminiscent of the Stokes layer on an oscillating flat plate, or the skin-depth penetration of an alternating magnetic field into an electrical conductor.
On the surface &lt;math&gt; u(r=R,t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the exponential term becomes negligible once &lt;math&gt;\alpha (1 - r/R)&lt;/math&gt; becomes large, the velocity profile becomes almost constant and independent of the viscosity. Thus, the flow simply oscillates as a plug profile in time according to the pressure gradient,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \sum^N_{n=0} P'_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, close to the walls, in a layer of thickness &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity adjusts rapidly to zero. Furthermore, the phase of the time oscillation varies quickly with position across the layer. The exponential decay of the higher frequencies is faster.

== Derivation ==

*Fluid is [[homogeneous]], [[incompressible]] and [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]];
*Tube wall is [[Stiffness|rigid]] and [[Circle|circular]];
*Motion is [[Laminar flow|laminar]], [[axisymmetric]] and parallel to the tube's axis;
*[[Boundary conditions]] are: axisymmetry at the centre, and no-slip condition on the wall;
*Pressure gradient is a [[periodic function]] that drives the fluid;
*[[Gravitation]] has no effect on the fluid.

Thus, the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation]] are simplified as

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =  -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =  0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. The pressure gradient driving the pulsatile flow is decomposed in [[Fourier series]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} (t) = \sum^N_{n=0}P'_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary number]], &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the first [[harmonic]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[amplitudes]] of each harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, &lt;math&gt;P'_0&lt;/math&gt; (standing for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is the steady-state pressure gradient, whose [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] is opposed to the steady-state velocity (i.e., a negative pressure gradient yields positive flow). Similarly, the velocity profile is also decomposed in Fourier series in [[Phase (waves)|phase]] with the pressure gradient, because the fluid is incompressible,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r,t) = \sum^N_{n=0}U_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitudes of each harmonic of the periodic function, and the steady component (&lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is simply [[Poiseuille flow]]

:&lt;math&gt; U_0 = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Navier-Stokes equation for each harmonic reads as

:&lt;math&gt; i\rho n\omega U_n =  -P'_n +\mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 U_n}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U_n}{\partial r}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

With the boundary conditions satisfied, the general solution of this [[ordinary differential equation]] for the oscillatory part (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = A_n \, J_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + B_n \, Y_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho\, n\, \omega}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of first kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;Y_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the Bessel function of second kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \surd( \omega \rho / \mu )&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dimensionless]] [[Womersley number]]. The axisymetic boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;\partial U_n/ \partial r|_{r=0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is applied to show that &lt;math&gt;B_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of above equation to be valid, as the derivatives &lt;math&gt;J_0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_0'&lt;/math&gt; approach infinity. Next, the wall non-slip boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;U_n(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;) yields &lt;math&gt; A_n = - \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \frac{1}{ J_0 \left( \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the amplitudes of the velocity profile of the harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2})} \right] = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n = \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; is used for simplification.
The velocity profile itself is obtained by taking the [[Real number|real]] part of the [[complex function]] resulted from the [[summation]] of all harmonics of the pulse,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r, t) = \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) + Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Flow rate ===
[[Discharge (hydrology)|Flow rate]] is obtained by integrating the velocity field on the cross-section. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^p J_p(a\,x) \right] = a\,x^p J_{p-1} (a\, x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\, J_1(a\,x) \right] = a\,x J_{0} (a\, x) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

then
 
:&lt;math&gt; Q(t) = \iint u(r, t) \, dA =  Re \left\{ \pi\,R^2 \, \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{2}{\Lambda_n}\frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Velocity profile===
[[File:Comparison of velocity profile of Womersley flow.svg|200px|thumb|Scaled velocity profiles of pulsatile flow are compared according to Womersley number.]]
To compare the shape of the velocity profile, it can be assumed that

:&lt;math&gt; 
 u(r,t) = f(r)\,\frac{Q(t)}{A} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; 
 f(r) = \frac{u(r,t)}{\frac{Q(t)}{A}} = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \left[ \frac{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - \Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - 2\,J_1(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the shape function.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to notice that this formulation ignores the inertial effects. The velocity profile approximates a parabolic profile or a plug profile, for low or high Womersley numbers, respectively.

=== Wall shear stress ===
For straight pipes, [[wall shear stress]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \right|_{r=R} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of a Bessel function is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ x^{-p} J_{-p} (a\,x) \right] = a\,x^{-p} J_{p+1}(a\,x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ J_0 (a\,x) \right] = -a\,J_1(a\,x) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} P'_n \frac{R}{\Lambda_n} \frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Centre line velocity ===
If the pressure gradient &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; is not measured, it can still be obtained by measuring the velocity at the centre line. The measured velocity has only the real part of the full expression in the form of

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{u}(t) = Re(u(0, t)) \equiv \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \, \cos(n \, \omega \, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;J_0(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the full physical expression becomes

:&lt;math&gt; u(0, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

at the centre line. The measured velocity is compared with the full expression by applying some properties of complex number. For any product of complex numbers (&lt;math&gt;C = AB&lt;/math&gt;), the amplitude and phase have the relations &lt;math&gt;|C| = |A||B|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_C = \phi_A + \phi_B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{U}_n = \left| \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
P'_n = \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{\phi} = 0 = \phi_{P'_n} + \phi_{U_n}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\phi_{P'_n} = \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

which finally yield

:&lt;math&gt; 
 \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| \, \cos \left\{ n\,\omega\,t + \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \right\} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Rasterisation''' (or '''rasterization''') is the task of taking an image described in a [[vector graphics]] format (shapes) and converting it into a [[raster image]] ([[pixel]]s or dots).&lt;ref name="Worboys1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael F. Worboys|title=GIS: A Computer Science Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duT2fcnQeJMC&amp;pg=PA232|date=30 October 1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7484-0065-2|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kang-Tsung Chang|title=Programming ArcObjects with VBA: A Task-Oriented Approach, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DOY9xuxcosC&amp;pg=PA91|date=27 August 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-0918-7|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rasterised image may then be  displayed on a [[computer display|video display]] or [[computer printer|printer]], or stored in a [[bitmap]] file format. Rasterisation may refer to either the conversion of [[3D model (computer graphics)|model]]s into raster files, or the conversion of 2D [[rendering primitive]]s such as [[polygon]]s or [[line segment]]s into a rasterized format. 


==Rasterisation of 3D images==
Compared with other rendering techniques such as [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rasterisation is extremely fast. However, rasterization is simply the process of computing the mapping from scene geometry to pixels and does not prescribe a particular way to compute the color of those pixels. [[Shading]], including [[Shading language|programmable shading]], may be based on physical light transport, or artistic intent.

The process of rasterising 3D models onto a 2D plane for display on a [[computer screen]] ("[[screen space]]") is often carried out by fixed function hardware within the [[graphics pipeline]]. This is because there is no motivation for modifying the techniques for rasterisation used at render time{{clarification needed|date=August 2016}} and a special-purpose system allows for high efficiency.

A '''refuge''' is a concept in [[ecology]], in which an organism obtains protection from [[predation]] by hiding in an area where it is inaccessible or cannot easily be found.

==Refuge based on predator exclusion==
Prey animals typically maintain larger populations when they have a place to physically hide from predation.

==Refuge based on migration==
Many prey animals systematically [[animal_migration|migrate]] between refuges and predator-rich feeding grounds, in patterns that minimize their chances of being caught by the predators.
The largest such migration by [[biomass_(ecology)|biomass]] is the oceans' [[diel vertical migration]], in which vast quantities of organisms hide in the [[Deep_sea_community#Zones|lightless depths]] of the open ocean, arising after dark to consume [[phytoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/ocean-magic-at-night|title=Migration: World's Biggest Takes Place in Ocean at Night|publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows them to avoid the large [[Pelagic_fish#Predator_fish|predatory fish]] of the open ocean, as these predators are primarily visual hunters and need light to effectively catch prey.  Similar types of migration also occur in fresh water. For example, small [[European perch]] exhibit a daily horizontal migration in some lakes in Finland. During the day they move away from the vegetated areas where the predation threat in the clear water is great, into more turbid open water areas, moving back at night because of the greater availability of [[zooplankton]] among the aquatic plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Issues in Ecosystem Ecology: 2011 Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oettgWPNE6IC&amp;pg=PT464 |year=2012 |publisher=Scholarly Editions |isbn=978-1-4649-6482-4 |pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge based on remoteness==
Refuge use reduces the likelihood of species extinction.&lt;ref name="FontanetoSanciangco2013" /&gt;  There have been a number of mass [[extinction event]]s. During some of these, denizens of the deep ocean have been relatively immune. The [[coelacanth]] for example, is a remnant species of a once common group of fishes, the [[Sarcopterygii]], which disappeared from shallow seas at the time of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago, leaving only a couple of surviving species.&lt;ref name=Priede&gt;{{cite book|author=Priede, Imants G. |title=Deep-Sea Fishes: Biology, Diversity, Ecology and Fisheries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBcwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-03345-6 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Renne |first=Paul R. |last2=Deino |first2=Alan L. |last3=Hilgen |first3=Frederik J. |last4=Kuiper |first4=Klaudia F. |last5=Mark |first5=Darren F. |last6=Mitchell |first6=William S. |last7=Morgan |first7=Leah E. |last8=Mundil |first8=Roland |last9=Smit |first9=Jan |title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |journal=Science |date=7 February 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6120 |pages=684–687 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492 |pmid=23393261 |url=http://www.cugb.edu.cn/uploadCms/file/20600/20131028144132060.pdf |bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many coral [[Taxon|taxa]] have used the deep ocean as a refuge, shifting from shallow to deep water and vice versa during their evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=Woodley&gt;{{cite book|author1=Woodley, Cheryl M. |author2=Downs, Craig A. |author3=Bruckner, Andrew W. |author4=Porter, James W. |author5=Galloway, Sylvia B.|title=Diseases of Coral|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8gbCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |year=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-8138-2411-6 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; By developing wings and taking flight, insects exploited the air as a refuge, a place of safety from ground-based predators; this successful evolutionary strategy set the insects on the path to occupying the dominant position they hold today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=La Greca, Marcello |year=1980 |title=Origin and evolution of wings and flight in insects |journal=Bollettino di Zoologia Italiana |volume=47 |pages=65–82 |doi=10.1080/11250008009438706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human societies show a similar effect, with remote mountainous regions such as [[Zomia]] or the [[Scottish Highlands]] serving as [[Refugium (population biology)| refugia]], allowing their inhabitants to maintain cultural traditions and languages that were being pushed to extinction in more accessible locations.&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringham |first1=Edward |title=Repelling States: Evidence from Upland Southeast Asia |journal=Review of Austrian Economics |date=2012|volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas|title=Basic Economics |date=2015 |isbn=978-0465060733 |pages=536-537 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge based on size==
Refuge strategies are often dependent on the size of the prey. The smallest individuals find it easiest to tuck themselves away in some hole or cranny, or if, like [[barnacle]]s, they are living on an exposed surface, are of negligible interest to predators like [[starfish]] because of their small size. Larger individuals are of interest, but they take refuge by settling further up the shore where the starfish cannot reach them when the tide is out, nor can [[whelk]]s drill through their shells because they remain submerged for insufficient time during each tidal cycle.&lt;ref name=Ricketts/&gt; In this situation, size is a refuge in itself, in that it enables the barnacle to escape desiccation under circumstances that might be lethal to smaller individuals.&lt;ref name=Ricketts&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ricketts, Edward Flanders |author2=Calvin, Jack |author3=Hedgpeth, Joel Walker |author4=Phillips, David W. |title=Between Pacific Tides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUl5ESavtRIC&amp;pg=PA477 |year=1985 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2068-7 |page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[tidepool sculpin]], which takes refuge in small rockpools when the tide is out, thus taking advantage of its small size and avoiding its larger fish predators.&lt;ref name=Kruckeberg&gt;{{cite book |author=Kruckeberg, Arthur R.|title=The Natural History of Puget Sound Country |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqtVmRNdHWwC&amp;pg=PA90 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-97477-4 |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Thomas Christian music''' refers to the [[music]]al traditions of the [[Saint Thomas Christian]] community of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is chiefly [[liturgical music|liturgical]] and is derived from ancient [[Syriac Christian]] music from the [[Middle East]], with remarkably little influence from local Indian styles. Of particular significance is the prevalence of the [[organum]] singing style. As a result of the community's isolation and conservatism, these traditions may retain elements of the earliest forms of [[Early Christian music]].

==History==
The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] trace their origins to the evangelical activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century. The community grew under the influence of migration from Syrians, members of the [[Church of the East]]. The community's modern musical traditions may be derived from this connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 83–85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 20th century, Saint Thomas Christian liturgy was performed and sung in the [[Syriac language]], though today this largely has been replaced with the local language, [[Malayalam]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the community's resistance to outside influence and isolation, the music of the Saint Thomas Christians may preserve elements of the earliest forms of Christian music.&lt;ref name=Ross80&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 80 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Israel G. Ross compares Saint Thomas Christian music to that of the [[Jews]] in Kerala. [[Jewish music]] influenced the early Christian music ancestral to the Saint Thomas Christian forms, and Jews have lived in similar conditions to the Thomas Christians in [[Kerala]] for centuries.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; As such, Christian and Jewish music and culture in Kerala feature many parallels and similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 80–81 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Saint Thomas Christian blessing given by a dying father to his children is similar to the Jewish [[Amidah]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 82|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; These similarities may reflect a common origin in the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref name=Ross88&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 88 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Saint Thomas Christian music derives from archaic Syriac forms, with little discernible influence from [[Indian classical music]] or other local traditions.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; [[Liturgical music]] is performed in two [[mode (music)|modes]]: ''kadmoyo'' and ''hamisoyo''. These are similar to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[maqama]]t'' and may be derived from an ancient [[Syriac sacral music|Syriac system]] that existed in the Middle East in the early centuries of Christianity, and which may be related to the system known as [[oktoechos]].&lt;ref name=Ross85/&gt; Intonation is similar to the Syriac standard, featuring no [[augmented second]] or [[microtonal]] alteration characteristic of Indian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 86 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[organum]] singing style is common in Saint Thomas Christian music. It appears in [[antiphons]], [[responsory|responsories]], and [[hymn]]s. Ross notes that this is found among three other disparate and isolated cultures: the nearby [[Cochin Jews]], the [[Yemenite Jews]], and the [[Samaritans]]. Organum may be sung in either duplum or triplum.  In the former it is sung in the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] when the boys and men sing together with the [[cantus firmus]] in the upper voice, or in the [[perfect fourth|fourth]] when the groups sing alone. In triplum it is sung in the fourth and octave.&lt;ref name=Ross88/&gt;

[[File:CommonOriginJewishandKeralaNasrani.JPG|Similarities in traditional liturgical music of Kerala Jews and Nasranis (Syrian Christians)]]

The [[Margam Kali]] is a traditional Saint Thomas Christian dance. The accompanying music is performed by a choir singing in Syriac chant, with a ''sleeyankolu'' ([[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]) maintaining rhythm. Another traditional instrument is the [[violin]] or ''revekka''.&lt;ref name= Choondal&gt;Chummar Choondal (1983). "Christian folk songs". ''Kerala Folklore Academy'', p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chant accentuation==
Traditional chant accentuation derives from the Syriac standard, which was instituted by the scholars known as the [[Masoretes]] in the Middle Ages. The form is similar to that codified by the [[Hebrew]] [[Linguist|grammarians]] of [[Tiberias]] for Jewish cantillation of the Bible. It features dot notation above, below, and to the side of words in the text. The names of the notations are expressive, reflecting the style of Syriac Bible reading and chant in general.&lt;ref name=Ross83&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 83|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thoma Parvam==
One important Saint Thomas Christian song is the "Thoma Parvam", or "Song of Thomas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christianity in India: From Beginnings to the Present |last= Frykenberg |first= Eric |year= 2008 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 0-19-826377-5 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song contains a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] claiming it was first written in 1601 by a certain Maliekel Thoma Ramban, though the manuscripts are of a much later date. The words give an account of [[Thomas the Apostle]]'s purported evangelical work in India in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thoma |first1= P.

The '''science of morality''' may refer to various forms of [[ethical naturalism]] grounding [[morality]] in rational, [[empirical]] consideration of the natural world.&lt;ref name="sep-naturalism-moral"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Lenman |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Moral Naturalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/naturalism-moral/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moral science may refer to the consideration of what is best for, and how to maximize the [[flourishing]] of, either particular individuals&lt;ref&gt;Carrier&lt;/ref&gt; or all conscious creatures.&lt;ref name="tedharris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Moral Landscape'', pp. 39ff&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that "morality" can be appropriately defined on the basis of fundamental premises necessary for ''any'' empirical, secular, and philosophical discussion and that societies can use the methods of science to provide answers to moral questions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Daleiden ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations''; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', 2010; and Richard Carrier ''Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = In sum, from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on [[David Hume|Hume]]’s warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences. The dictum can be set aside for a deeper, albeit programmatic, neurobiological perspective on what reasoning and problem-solving are, how social navigation works, how evaluation is accomplished by nervous systems, and how mammalian brains make decisions.|source = — [[Patricia Churchland]] in her book ''Braintrust'' (emphasis added)}}
The norms advocated by moral scientists (e.g. rights to [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and [[drug liberalization]] under certain circumstances) would be founded upon the shifting and growing collection of human understanding.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;  Even with science's admitted degree of ignorance, and the various semantic issues, moral scientists can meaningfully discuss things as being ''almost certainly'' "better" or "worse" for promoting flourishing.&lt;ref name=HarrisFlourishing&gt;Sam Harris (2010), page 183: "Much of the skepticism I encounter when speaking about these issues comes from people who think "happiness" is a superficial state of mind and that there are far more important things in life than "being happy." Some reasers may think that concepts like "well-being" and "flourishing" are similarly effete. However, I don't know of any better terms with which to signify the most positive states of being to which we can aspire. One of the virtues of thinking about a moral landscape, the heights of which remain to be discovered, is that it frees us from these semantic difficulties. Generally speaking, we need only worry about what it will mean to move "up" as opposed to "down".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In philosophy===
[[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] discussed some of the ways moral investigations are a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Deontology, or The Science of Morality''&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes [[Deontology|deontological ethics]] for failing to recognize that it needed to make the same presumptions as his science of morality to really work – whilst pursuing rules that were to be obeyed in every situation (something that worried Bentham).

[[W.V.O. Quine]] advocated naturalizing epistemology by looking to natural sciences like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge.{{explain|date=October 2015}} His work contributed to a resurgence of moral naturalism in the last half of the 20th century. [[Paul Kurtz]], who believes that the careful, secular pursuit of normative rules is vital to society, coined the term ''eupraxophy'' to refer to his approach to normative ethics. [[Steven Pinker]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Peter Singer]] believe that we learn what is right and wrong through reason and empirical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/steven-pinker-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate1&gt;At 11:25 in the video debate at http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Ossowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Maria Ossowska]] used the methods of science to understand the origins of moral norms.]]
[[Maria Ossowska]] thought that sociology was inextricably related to philosophical reflections on morality, including normative ethics. She proposed that science analyze: (a) existing social norms and their history, (b) the psychology of morality, and the way that individuals interact with moral matters and prescriptions, and (c) the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/311 Marcin T. Zdrenka. (2006). "Moral philosopher or sociologist of morals?". Journal of Classical Sociology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular literature===
The theory and methods of a normative science of morality are explicitly discussed in Joseph Daleiden's ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations'' (1998). Daleiden's book, in contrast to Harris, extensively discusses the relevant philosophical literature.  In ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'', [[Sam Harris]]'s goal is to show how moral truth can be backed by "science", or more specifically, [[empirical knowledge]], critical thinking, philosophy, but most controversially, the [[scientific method]].

[[Patricia Churchland]] offers that, accepting [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[Is–ought problem|is-ought problem]], the use of induction from premises and definitions remains a valid way of reasoning in life and science.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Our moral behavior, while more complex than the social behavior of other animals, is similar in that it represents our attempt to manage well in the existing social ecology....from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on Hume's warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences....The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for caring—for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin, and others—shape social reasoning about many issues: conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia Smith |last=Churchland |year=2011 |title=Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13703-2 |lccn=2010043584 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLsIzyFR08IC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Patricia Churchland|Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality}}

Daleiden and [[Leonard Carmichael]] warn that science is probabilistic, and that [[certainty]] is not possible. One should therefore expect that moral prescriptions will change as humans gain understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p502, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|To quote Carmichael: "We do not turn aside from what we know about astronomy at any time because there is still a great deal we do not know, or because so much of what we once thought we knew is no longer recognized as true. May not the same argument be accepted in our thinking about ethical and esthetic judgements?"&lt;ref&gt;Leaonard Carmichael, the chapter "Absolutes, Relativism and the Scientific Psychology of Human Nature", H. Schoeck and J. Wiggins (eds), in the book "Relativism and the Study of Man, Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand, 1961, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

==Views in scientific Morality==
{{See also|Moral psychology}}

===Training to promote good behaviour===
The science of morality may aim to discover the best ways to motivate and shape individuals. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit [[virtue]]s, building [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|character strengths]], and forming [[Association (psychology)|mental associations]]. These generally require some level of practical reason. James Rest suggested that abstract reasoning is also a factor in making moral judgements&lt;ref name=RestJudging/&gt; and emphasized that moral judgements alone do not predict moral behaviour: “Moral judgement may be closely related to advocacy behaviour, which in turn influences social institutions, which in turn creates a system of norms and sanctions that influences people’s behaviour.”&lt;ref name=RestJudging&gt;James R. Rest, Development in Judging Moral Issues. (1979). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden suggested that religions instill a practical sense of virtue and justice, right and wrong. They also effectively use art and myths to educate people about moral situations.&lt;ref&gt;323, 326, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of government====
Harris argues that moral science does not imply an "[[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian future" with "scientists at every door". Instead, Harris imagines data about normative moral issues being shared in the same way as other sciences (e.g. peer-reviewed journals on medicine).&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ www.salon.com] Asked "Let's say scientists do end up discovering moral truths. How are they supposed to enforce their findings? Would they become something like policemen or priests?" Harris writes ''"They wouldn’t necessarily enforce them any more than they enforce their knowledge about human health. What are scientists doing with the knowledge that smoking causes cancer or obesity is bad for your health, or that the common cold is spread by not washing your hands? We’re not living in some Orwellian world where we have scientists in lab coats at every door. Imagine we discovered that there is a best way to teach your children to be compassionate, or to defer short-term gratification in the service of a long-term goal. What if it turns out to be true that calcium intake in the first two years of life has a significant effect on a child’s emotional life? If we learn that, what parent wouldn’t want that knowledge? The fear of a "Brave New World" component to this argument is unfounded."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Daleiden specifies that government, like any organization, should have limited power. He says "centralization of power irrevocably in the hands of one person or an elite has always ultimately led to great evil for the human race. It was the novel experiment of democracy—a clear break with tradition—that ended the long tradition of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;219, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also explicit that [[government]] should only use law to enforce the most basic, reasonable, evidence and widely supported moral norms. In other words, there are a great many moral norms that should never be the task of the government to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;273–274, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of punishment====
{{Main|Differential reinforcement|Prison}}
One author has argued that to attain a society where people are motivated by conditioned self-interest, [[punishment]] must go hand-in-hand with [[reward system|reward]].&lt;ref&gt;77, Daleiden (1998), quote “We use rewards and punishments, praise and blame, in training any animal. The human species is only different in degree in this regard, not in kind.”&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in this line of reasoning, prison remains necessary for many perpetrators of crimes. This is so, even if libertarian free will is false. This is because punishment can still serve its purposes: it deters others from committing their own crimes, educates and reminds everyone about what the society stands for, incapacitates the criminal from doing more harm, goes some way to relieving or repaying the victim, and corrects the criminal (also see [[recidivism]]). This author argues that, at least, any prison system ''should'' be pursuing those goals, and that it is an empirical question as to what sorts of punishment realize these goals most effectively, and how well various [[prison]] systems actually serve these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;289, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
{{see also| Positive psychology|Moral development}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ "Bzdok, D. et al. Parsing the neural correlates of moral cognition: ALE meta-analysis on morality, theory of mind, and empathy. Brain Struct Funct, 2011."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.
An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R. Nathan |title=Salience network engagement with the detection of morally laden information |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1118–1127 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsx035|pmid=28338944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=W. W. |last2=Menon |first2=V. |last3=Schatzberg |first3=A. F. |last4=Keller |first4=J. |last5=Glover |first5=G. H. |last6=Kenna |first6=H. |last7=Reiss |first7=A. L. |last8=Greicius |first8=M. D. |title=Dissociable Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Salience Processing and Executive Control |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |date=28 February 2007 |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2349–2356 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5587-06.2007|pmc=2680293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menon |first1=Vinod |last2=Uddin |first2=Lucina Q. |title=Saliency, switching, attention and control: a network model of insula function |journal=Brain Structure and Function |date=29 May 2010 |volume=214 |issue=5–6 |pages=655–667 |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0262-0|pmc=2899886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. This suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.

===Other implications===

Daleiden provides examples of how science can use empirical evidence to assess the effect that specific behaviors can have on the well-being of individuals and society with regard to various moral issues. He argues that science supports [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization and regulation of drugs]], euthanasia under some circumstances, and the permission of sexual behaviors that are not tolerated in some cultures (he cites [[homosexuality]] as an example). Daleiden further argues that in seeking to reduce human suffering, [[abortion]] should not only be permissible, but at times a moral obligation (as in the case of a mother of a potential child who would face the probability of much suffering). Like all moral claims in his book, however, Daleiden is adamant that these decisions remain grounded in, and contingent on empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joseph Daleiden's final word regarding his book, ''The Science of Morality,'' is that “[The study of ethics] should be included with the social sciences and be subject to as rigorous a scientific program of research as any other area of human behaviour. Lacking this scientific rigour, the moral conclusions drawn in this volume must be considered as working hypotheses, some with greater degree of evidentiary support than others. It is the process by which to assess and transmit moral norms that was the primary focus of this work, and I hope it will serve as a new way of deciding moral issues.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of [[cultural relativity]], to Daleiden, do offer some lessons: investigators must be careful not to judge a person's behaviour without understanding the environmental context. An action may be necessary and more moral once we are aware of circumstances.&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"&gt;100, Daleiden&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daleiden emphasizes that this does not mean all ethical norms or systems are equally effective at promoting flourishing&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"/&gt; and he often offers the equal treatment of women as a reliably superior norm, wherever it is practiced.

== Criticisms ==

The idea of a normative science of morality has met with some criticisms. Critics include physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], who argues that morality cannot be part of science.&lt;ref name=twsJun14eef&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Sean Carroll
 |title= Science And Morality: You Can’t Derive 'Ought' From 'Is'
 |publisher= ''NPR''
 |quote= Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches. A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness. The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means. ...Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible. ... Morality is not part of science, however much we would like it to be. There are a large number of arguments one could advance for in support of this claim, but I'll stick to three.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other critics cite the widely held "[[fact-value distinction]]", that the [[scientific method]] cannot answer "moral" questions, although it can describe the norms of different cultures. In contrast, moral scientists defend the position that such a division between values and scientific facts ("moral relativism") is not only arbitrary and illusory, but impeding progress towards taking action against documented cases of human rights violations in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Moralconfusion&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Sam Harris
 |title= Moral confusion in the name of "science"
 |publisher= ''PROJECT REASON''
 |quote= There are also very practical, moral concerns that follow from the glib idea that anyone is free to value anything—the most consequential being that it is precisely what allows highly educated, secular, and otherwise well-intentioned people to pause thoughtfully, and often interminably, before condemning practices like compulsory veiling, genital excision, bride-burning, forced marriage, and the other cheerful products of alternative “morality” found elsewhere in the world. Fanciers of Hume’s is/ought distinction never seem to realize what the stakes are, and they do not see what an abject failure of compassion their intellectual “tolerance” of moral difference amounts to. While much of this debate must be had in academic terms, this is not merely an academic debate. There are women and girls getting their faces burned off with acid at this moment for daring to learn to read, or for not consenting to marry men they have never met, or even for the crime of getting raped.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that science and religion occupy "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]". To Gould, science is concerned with questions of fact and theory, but not with meaning and morality – the magisteria of religion. In the same vein, [[Edward Teller]] proposed that politics decides what is right, whereas science decides what is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5367/1200 Essays on Science and Society. "Science and Morality".]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a discussion on the role that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] might play in professions like [[nursing]], Philosopher Trevor Hussey calls the popular view that science is unconcerned with morality "too simplistic". Although his main focus in the paper is naturalism in nursing, he goes on to explain that science can, at very least, be interested in morality at a descriptive level. He even briefly entertains the idea that morality could itself be a scientific subject, writing that one ''might'' argue "..that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one. If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here."
{{#tag:ref|Hussey writes "The relationship between naturalism and morality and politics is complicated, and is difficult to state in a few sentences because it involves deep philosophical issues. Only the briefest discussion is possible here. The most popular view is that science, and hence naturalism, is concerned with objective facts and not with values: with what is the case rather than what ought to be. But this is too simplistic." He gives a reason immediately: "First, at the very least, science can study morality and politics at a descriptive level and try to understand their workings within societies and in the lives of individuals, and investigate their evolutionary origins, their social propagation, and so on." Hussey then describes how scientists must adhere to certain values, but also how values guide what it is that science may investigate. His real interest in the paper is to justify naturalism as a nursing practice, yet he does eventually write: "Finally, the idea that science and morality are separate realms, one dealing with facts the other with values, is not as certain and clear-cut as it seems. Various versions of moral realism are now widely discussed among philosophers (e.g. Railton, 1986, 1996, 2003; Sayre-McCord, 1988; Dancy, 1993; Casebeer, 2003; Shafer-Landau, 2003; Baghramian, 2004; Smith, 1994, 2004). Despite their differences, moral realists generally agree on two principles. First, that our moral utterances, such as ‘Murder is morally wrong’ or ‘We ought to be honest’ are genuine statements and hence they are capable of being either true or false. Second, what makes them either true or false are aspects of the real world, open to objective examination. It can be argued that it is an implication of this thesis that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one." He continues "If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here. It is sufficient to say that it has at least as much credibility as any theory claiming a supernatural or divine foundation for morality: views which, while popular among the general public, do not have widespread support among moral philosophers – for what that is worth." Hussey thus directs discussion back towards Naturalism in nursing because his main point in all this was, in the end, to prove that naturalistic moralities are not necessarily less credible than supernatural ones, and may even be more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalistic nursing, Trevor Hussey (2011), Nursing Philosophy, Vol 12, Pg.45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">'''Space psychology''' refers to applying psychology to advise [[human spaceflight]]. This includes applying [[industrial and organizational psychology]] to team selection, individual and team mental preparation, team training, and ongoing psychological support,&lt;ref&gt;Freiberg, Peter. (1998). "Psychology keeps astronauts well grounded."''Monitor'', ''American Psychological Association'', March Edition, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and applying [[human factors and ergonomics]] to the construction of [[spacecraft]] to ensure sufficient [[habitability]].

==Components of industrial/organizational psychology==
The field is necessary for planning for and accomplishing successful [[human spaceflight]] missions by ensuring readiness for the unique physiological and psychological challenges posed by spending extended time in closed isolated environments like spacecraft. It is critical that each team member functions individually and as a team in order to avoid [[human error]], overcome unforeseeable challenges, and complete the mission. 
Due to the importance of team reliance on mission success, the field has focused on [[team composition and cohesion in spaceflight missions]] ever since 1957's [[Project Mercury]]. This involves applying and conducting research from [[social psychology]], [[group dynamics]], group performance and team psychology, and applying it to select team members that will be able to live together in close quarters for an extended amount of time, and create team training programs that improve team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Novotney, Amy. (2013). "I/O psychology goes to Mars" ''Monitor on Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to [[teamwork]], there is an assortment of [[psychological and sociological effects of spaceflight]] that needs to be addressed in order to plan for successful space missions, such as [[loneliness]], unavailability of familial [[mental health]] support, elevated levels of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] due to demanding tasks, and reduced material comforts.

==Components of human factors and ergonomics==
To ensure [[habitability]] of constructed [[spacecraft]], [[human factors and ergonomics]] specialists must advise on environmental requirements such as lighting, room layout and design, sound requirements, and solutions for the physiological challenges posed by being in an environment without gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmire, Alexandra. (2014). "The Use of Psychology to Inform the Design of Future Space Vehicles and Habitats". ''American Psychological Association Convention Presentation''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Factor in space has to deal not only with adapting to different physical habitats, but also to different social habitats and different communication settings. New activities such as performing human extravehicular activity (EVA) beyond the low Earth orbit environment require complex synchronization methods. The ergonomic approach to these environments has to include new variables, such as time delay in communication due to speed of light transmission limitations. Astronauts will become increasingly isolated from Earth-based mission support and thus will rely heavily on their own decision-making capabilities and onboard tools to accomplish proposed EVA mission objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Matthew|title=Information flow model of human extravehicular activity operations|journal=IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings 2015|date=June 2015|doi=10.1109/AERO.2015.7118942|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282954950_Information_flow_model_of_human_extravehicular_activity_operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Most published research specific to space psychology has been conducted by [[NASA]]s [[Human Systems Integration Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Barrett. (2006). "Group Performance and space flight teams: Chapter 8" in Bowers, Salas and Jentsch. (2006). "Creating High-Tech Teams: Practical Guidance on Work Performance and Technology." ''American Psychological Association''&lt;/ref&gt; Tests conducted to ensure team success include putting a team in an airtight quarters on earth for an extended period of time, such as in the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/ground/1.3Crewmembers.pdf Nasa Lunar-Mars Life Support Test]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the context of space flight, teamwork is an essential ingredient in successful missions. A variety of adverse influences may negatively impact the performance of mission teams both on the ground and in flight. Such influences may include physical stressors on the organism such as diurnal disruption, effects of microgravity, injury, or task overload as well as psychological factors such as social isolation, role overload, or interpersonal conflict among team members. Given the importance of team effectiveness, NASA’s Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) has identified a need to monitor the functioning of teams, primarily using unobtrusive means. The purpose of such monitoring lies in providing a stream of indicators that can serve several operational goals:
# Monitoring during personnel selection activities can provide input for the selection of compatible team members and of individuals with psychological profiles suited to teamwork in extreme environments and situations.
# Monitoring during training activities can provide diagnostic information useful in guiding further instruction and coaching as well as in determining the composition of teams prior to mission deployment.
# Monitoring during missions can provide forewarning of potential operational failures due to disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Maidel, &amp; Jeffrey M. Stanton (2010), ''Unobtrusive Monitoring of Spaceflight Team Functioning. Literature Review and Operational Assessment for NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Element''. School of Information Studies, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication,''''' written by American scholar [[John Durham Peters]], is a classic and important work in Commucation area and also the first and most well-known book of John Durham Peters. In this book, the author asserts that communicating like angels is "impossible" but it is not just a tragic fact but also a blessed one. This book talks about the history of communication failure from different aspects like philosophy, politics, media technology and so forth. This book won the [[National Communication Association]] Award in 2000.

== Themes ==
''Speaking into the Air: A history of the Idea of Communication'' studies on Communication failure. It contains five phrases of history of the idea of Communication, Plaeo's eros, The Bible's one-way dissemination, Religious Angle communication in Middle Ages, Spiritual communication in modern philosophy, and the communication idea in modern communication theory. It also involves the subject machines, animals and aliens as horizons of incommunicability.

== Book review ==
At the end of the Introduction "he Problem of Communication", Peters asserts that "dissemination" can be more charming：

"The most beautiful thing about our contact with each other is its free dissemination, not its anguished communion. The ultimate futility of our attempts to "communicate" is not lamentable; it is a handsome condition. The notion of communication deserves to be liberated from its earnestness and spiritualism, its demand for precision and agreement, demands whose long history I attempt to illustrate in this book. The requirement of interpersonal mimesis can be despotic...The idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible."

And then in the first chapter "Dialogue and Dissemination", Peters compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination and makes an argument that “dialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just”, which provides an interesting perspective of one-way communication: dissemination. And my study about dissemination of Chinese literature is based on the pressing industries, is all about book. Compared to radio, television, internet, books like newspaper, magazines and other pressing productions can be more like the media of one-way communication, since we can easily make instant interactions through radio, television, internet but as for books, due to the lack of interaction, the audiences may have more time and freedom to interpret meanings by themselves.

To illustrate, we may use the theory of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right:
[[File:Encoding-decoding.gif|thumb]]
A programme can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, the two sides have hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non-rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other’s opinions and maybe they have to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissemination overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can’t compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of "dissemination"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that “ the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.”

'''''The History of Human Marriage''''' is an 1891 book about the history of human marriage by the Finnish philosopher [[Edvard Westermarck]]. The work is a classic in its field.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''The History of Human Marriage'' is an overview of the world history of human marriage.&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Westermarck argues that marriage is a social institution that rests on a biological foundation, and developed through a process in which human males came to live together with human females for sexual gratification, companionship, mutual economic aid, procreation, and the joint rearing of offspring.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly reception==
[[David Blankenhorn]] calls the book one of the best histories of human marriage, and considers it deservedly famous. He comments, however, that it leaves out a great deal of material while "skimming too quickly over too much."&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910" /&gt; Blankenhorn believes, however, that scholarship subsequent to Westermarck's has tended to support his conclusions.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37" /&gt;

The Finnish philosopher [[Jaakko Hintikka]] calls the work a monumental study and a classic in its field, but notes that it is now antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin95|Hintikka 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Juice Media''' ('''TJM''') is an Australian film and media company, that produces contemporary political and social satire. They are known for their Internet series Honest Government Ads and Juice Rap News.

TJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the "Australien" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.

== History ==

TJM was founded by [[Giordano Nanni]], an Australian [[historian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|title=DR GIORDANO NANNI - The University of Melbourne|date=2012-09-11|access-date=2018-06-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052814/https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[author]], [[Satire|satirist]] and [[Video production|video producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logancij.com/speaker/giordano/|title=Giordano Nanni|work=The Logan CIJ Symposium|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; TJM started publishing on [[YouTube|YouTube]] in May 2008 with the first episode of [[Juice Rap News]] premiering on 4 October 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRw8GAAtm27q4R3Q0kst_g|title=thejuicemedia|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/about/|title=About - The Juice Media|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial ''Australia Day'' (Piracy parody).

== Controversy ==

=== Australien Coat of Harms ===
[[File:Australien Govt - Coat of Harms - by THEJUICEMEDIA.png|thumb|Australien Coat of Harms as created by The Juice Media]]The Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Commonwealth Coat of Arms]] that it lampoons including:

* A stylised alien head replacing the Commonwealth star
* The heads of the emu and kangaroo have been replaced with surveillance cameras
* The bar under the star has been replaced with a buffering bar
* The 6 state emblems on the shield have been replaced with a pirate ship
* The "Australia" wording under the shield has been replaced with "Not the Real Logo"

In September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].

The summary for the Bill was stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the [[Attorney general|Attorney-General]] [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[George Brandis]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=George Brandis on Genuine Satire|date=2017-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLzPuNL0BKU|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/ImpersonatingaCommBody/Submissions|title=Submissions|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the submissions were pieces from [[Australian Lawyers for Human Rights]] and [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=310dc8e6-72ba-4760-9f6e-4ac8ae2a2147&amp;subId=561090|title=Australian Lawyers for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/australian-government-wants-give-satire-boot|title=Australian Government Wants to Give Satire The Boot|last=Nazer|first=Daniel|date=2017-10-20|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alhr.org.au/2017-alhr-human-rights-report-card/|title=2017 ALHR Human Rights Report Card - ALHR|date=2018-01-11|work=ALHR|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171023/07223238458/australian-lawmakers-propose-outlawing-parody-having-sense-humor.shtml|title=Australian Lawmakers Propose Outlawing Parody, Having A Sense Of Humor|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by [[Adam Bandt|Adam Bandt]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to "mercilessly troll government".&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"/&gt;

[[Nick McKim|Senator Nick McKim]] is on record as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Where does this leave satire in Australia? Does it mean that figures such as [[Shaun Micallef]], The Juice Media and [[The Chaser]] team, as well as upcoming comedians, will have to think twice before they crack jokes lest they find themselves on the stand or in the slammer? As the government's then Attorney-General put it, 'The test of what genuine satire is will be, as I said, up to the [[court]]s.' [[Law of Australia|Australian common law]] has never previously had to deal with defining genuine satire, meaning that satirists will be in the dark as to the potential limits of their jokes until a body of common law has been established''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?id=2018-05-10.187.1|title=Criminal Code Amendment...: 10 May 2018: Senate debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia Day (Piracy Parody) ===
On 24 January 2017 TJM released a [[parody]] of a well known [[Copy protection|anti-piracy]] ad, colloquially dubbed "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", called Australia Day (Piracy parody).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=Australia Day (Piracy parody)|date=2017-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytdM-x3cv4|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video compared the celebration of [[Australia Day]] (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the [[First Fleet]],  to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include [[Nazism|Nazi's]] "[[Final Solution]]", dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]] and [[September 11 attacks|Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4158072/Ad-compares-Australia-Day-September-11.html?ito=social-twitter_DailyMailAU|title=Ad compares Australia Day to celebrating September 11|last=|first=|date=|work=UK Daily Mail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/this-video-compares-the-settling-of-australia-to-911-hiroshi|title=This Video Compares Australian Settlement To 9/11, Hiroshima And The Holocaust|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#[[changethedate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/01-02/australia-dystopia/|title=Australia Dystopia|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Straight]] Islander and wider community groups.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-25/invasion-day-video-compares-australia-day-to-september-11/8211630?pfmredir=sm|title='You wouldn't celebrate September 11': Ad compares Australia Day to tragic world events|date=2017-01-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation," Shaun Fielding said.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[National Australia Day Council]] said in response:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/fremantle-divided-over-cancellation-of-australia-day-festivities/8207954|title='An act of betrayal': City divided over Australia Day cancellation|date=2017-01-24|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honest Government Ads are filmed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are written by Giordano Nanni who creates the series in collaboration with Lucy Cahill. Actors appearing in the series are credited as Ellen Burbidge, Zoë Amanda Wilson and Matylda Buczko-Koren with Lucy Cahill also being credited with the voice overs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These videos are a satirical take on [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] advertising. Each video targets a current social or political issue and highlights potential consequences of the Government's position and policy on that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/86230-new-crimes-impersonating-federal-agencies-poorly-drafted/|title=Critics say new crimes of 'impersonating' federal agencies are poorly drafted {{!}} The Mandarin|date=2017-11-22|work=The Mandarin|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"And an increasingly popular way of sharing the ‘honest truth' about political events is through satirical videos, something that The Juice Media does brilliantly. They bring attention to the ridiculousness of political and worldwide events, not only by making people laugh but by being blunt about what is going on and how people are being taken advantage of.

As part of the Honest Government ad series TJM has published three ads which are mock tourism ads highlighting the history and ongoing effects of [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] in certain countries. These have been produced for [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15576">'''''The Meaning of the City''''' is a theological essay by [[Jacques Ellul]] which recounts the story of the [[city]] in the [[Bible]] and seeks to explain the city's biblical significance.

Ellul wrote the book in 1951; it was published in English translation in 1970, and then in French in 1975 as ''Sans feu ni lieu : Signification biblique de la Grande Ville''.

== Synopsis ==
Where is the city's foundation? All [[mythology|mythologies]] speak of an [[Garden of Eden|original garden]], returning to which is man's only desire. The city is the world of man: his creation (made in his image) and his pride because it reflects his culture and his civilization. It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man's power over Nature and man, a place of [[slavery]] par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the [[History of the city|city's origins]]. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man's return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the [[New Jerusalem]]. "This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts."&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Rognon, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-une-pensee-en-dialogue/oclc/180983332&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Jacques Ellul : Une pensée en dialogue''], éd. Labor et Fides, 2007, p.86 [http://www.jacques-ellul.org/influences/la-bible]. "Cela signifie que, par amour, Dieu révise ses propres desseins, pour tenir compte de l'histoire des hommes, y compris de leurs plus folles révoltes."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the [[fall of man]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do.

== Exegesis ==
Ellul gives an [[exegesis]] of the city in the Bible. This is not a formalist or structuralist exegesis, but a traditional exegesis, which is to say it seeks to present the text as it appears today and in its entirety. This means that the author, here, seeks within the Bible all passages which relate to the city, as the basis for a biblical definition of this place. If the author "hears" the more sophisticated meanings given by his contemporaries, he nevertheless considers that one "cannot honestly interpret a text outside its content and the meaning which it gives itself". He therefore refuses to divide the text into independent fragments, instead taking them in their entirely; he considers the text to be essentially [[dialectical]], implying that its meaning arises within an ensemble of contradictory statements. So doing, Ellul does not seek to explain why the Bible says what it says on the subject of cities, but to show what it says.

== Critique of the city ==
It is within the framework of his critique of technique (see ''[[The Technological Society]]'') that Ellul approaches the city. In effect, according to him, the city is the place where technique becomes [[system]], preventing man from living in freedom. And according to Ellul, this freedom arises in work within proximity to God, and later in the perfect example of [[Jesus Christ]]. Thus, "if one follows Ellul, humanity's freedom of choice seems singularly limited: return to the path of the Christian God or accept the dissolution of humanity. Strictly speaking this conception of liberty is a negation of autonomy, is a [[heteronomy]]. Facing this dilemma to which Ellul condemns us, how can we raise a challenge, how can we find a truly autonomous liberty, which is to say find its true characteristics and true limits?".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Jézéquel, ''Jacques Ellul ou l’impasse de la technique'', Revue du Mauss, 2010. "si l’on suit Ellul, la liberté de choix de l’humanité semble singulièrement restreinte : retrouver le chemin du Dieu chrétien ou se résigner à la disparition de l’humanité. Stricto sensu cette conception de la liberté est une négation de l’autonomie, c’est une hétéronomie. Face au dilemme auquel nous condamne Ellul, comment relever le défi, comment retrouver une liberté véritablement autonome, c’est-à-dire trouvant en elle-même ses propres déterminations et ses propres limites ?"&lt;/ref&gt; This remark, published in the ''[[Revue du MAUSS]]'', critiques Ellul's theistic thrust, but also shows the extent to which man wants to live without God, considering that true liberty cannot exist in relation to a creator.

The city is precisely the place created by man. It is the affirmation of man taking his life into his own hands, independently of God; it is the expression of man's rebellion against God. God has placed man at the garden, a place adapted to him. But man refuses the life for which God has destined him, which is unsettled, and men have gathered and organized themselves in order to depend no longer on nature. This political project (see Ellul 1965, ''L'Illusion politique''), the management of the metropolis, underlies the city: security, survival, commerce, collective living... But this city, created to strengthen human solidarity and protect man against natural aggressions, becomes the place to isolation and insecurity. "Divine or celestial, the city reflects with the space of European culture a religious ideal of 'collective life', on which converge all the major issues of future society. The eater of men and the producer of social regulations, of power conflicts and [[culture shock]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.10). "Divine ou céleste, la cité renvoie dans l’espace culturel européen à l’image d’un idéal religieux du « vivre ensemble » où convergent tous les enjeux majeurs de la société future. Mangeuse d’hommes et productrice de nouvelles économies, la ville s’apparente à un espace où s’opèrent toutes sortes de mobilités démographiques, de régulations sociales, de conflits de pouvoir et de chocs culturels"&lt;/ref&gt; The history of cities is the history of religions cross and interlocking, and of the Christian experience of this relationship, principally in relation to the urban conquest through which religion expanded itself. Since the 1960s, thinkers have raised the question of the "Secular City",&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cite-seculiere-essai-theologique-sur-la-secularisation-et-lurbanisation/oclc/77172490&amp;referer=brief_results ''La Cité séculière. Essai théologique sur la sécularisation et l’urbanisation''], Paris, Casterman, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Comblin, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/theologie-de-la-ville/oclc/299893060&amp;referer=brief_results ''Théologie de la ville''], Paris, Éditions Universitaires, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''], Paris, Gallimard, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and the city has become a "theological issue".&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the urban project, which diverts man from God, will at the last be judged severely.

The city is also the location of spiritual conflict. It therefore bears a profound meaning, a spiritual mark, which is the sign of malediction, and the founder of the city is cursed among all. "It is through slavery that Israel is linked to the city." All the cities, within the Bible, are cursed, and "never a word of hope, never a word of pardon for the city, for it is a terrible manifestation of the brilliant morning star, which has debased humanity." This malediction explains all the difficulties, all the problems encountered in cities, and however much one may seek solutions (security, urbanism, isolation), man will never make the city anything but that which it is. Here, one can detect the influence of Ellul's good friend [[Bernard Charbonneau]]. "Ellul was constantly recognizing his debt to Charbonneau", said pastor and theologian Jean-Sébastien Ingrand, director of the Strausbourg Protestant Media Library. Together they published "Outline of a personalist manifesto", in which they denounced, among other things, the city as contrary to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul et Bernard Charbonneau, ''Directives pour un manifeste personnaliste'', 1935, texte dactylographié édité par les groupes d'Esprit de la région du Sud-ouest; publié en 2003 par [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cahiers-jacques-ellul-no-1-les-annees-personnalistes-pour-une-critique-de-la-societe-technicienne/oclc/52772778&amp;referer=brief_results les Cahiers Jacques-Ellul n°1, "''Les années personnalistes''"], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "The man of the city is rich in money but poor in space and time", they wrote. "The city is a place of inhumanity, especially the ''[[banlieue]]'', a banal and homogeneous space, the exact opposite of the country. The city is a place of artifice, where nature is vanquished. But note: one must not romanticize nature, which is perfectly capable of defending itself alone. It is man who is fragile, and above all his liberty. Bernard Charbonneau with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jardin-de-babylone/oclc/2547227&amp;referer=brief_results ''Le jardin de Babylone''] (1969) and Jacques Ellul with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''] (1975), rediscovered this point.&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"&gt;Roger Cans, ''compte-rendu d’un colloque sur Bernard Charbonneau, précurseur de l’écologie'', organisé du 2 au 4 mai 2011 à l’IRSAM (université de Pau). "L’homme des villes est riche d’argent, mais pauvre d’espace et de temps », écrivent-ils. « La ville est un lieu d’inhumanité, la banlieue surtout, espace banalisé et uniforme, l’exact opposé de la campagne. La ville est un lieu d’artifice, où la nature est vaincue. Mais attention : il ne faut pas idéologiser la nature, qui se défend très bien toute seule. C’est l’homme qui est fragile, et surtout sa liberté. Bernard Charbonneau avec ''Le jardin de Babylone'' (1969) et Jacques Ellul avec Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu'' (1975), se retrouvent sur ce point"&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has grown to the size foretold by Ellul and Charbonneau, who were witnessing the urbanization of the world, the universalization of technique, and the standardization of all civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Porquet]], « Nous tous pareils » in [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-lhomme-qui-avait-presque-tout-prevu/oclc/401756457&amp;referer=brief_results ''Jacques Ellul - L'homme qui avait (presque) tout prévu''], Le Cherche-Midi, 2003, p. 151-158&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 2008, the world's urban population surpassed its rural population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronoo.com/fr/articles/population-mondiale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Where Charbonneau applied the symbol of [[Babylon]], Ellul focuses on [[Ninevah]]. The big city is a mass which cannot survive without sacrificing liberty. "This, then, is what separates the two men: against the catastrophism of Charbonneau, Ellul presents a Christian hope, which leads from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem foretold in Revelations.".&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">In [[manufacturing]], an '''undercut''' is a special type of recessed surface. In [[turning]], it refers to a recess in a diameter. In [[machining]], it refers to a recess in a corner. In [[molding (process)|molding]], it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In [[printed circuit board]], construction it refers to the portion of the copper that is [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] away under the [[photoresist]]. In [[welding]], it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead. 

==Turning==
[[File:Undercut turning.png|thumb|400px|An example of a turned part with and without an undercut]]

On turned parts an undercut is also known as a ''neck'' or "relief groove". They are often used at the end of the threaded portion of a shaft or [[screw]] to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as ''thread relief'' in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least {{convert|0.015|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the [[minor diameter]] of the thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Thread relief and chamfers | url = http://www.pmpa.org/technology/design/threadrelief.htm | work = PMPA's Designer's Guide | publisher = Precision Machined Products Association | accessdate = 2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread.  Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter.  They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on [[technical drawing]]s by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2004|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molding==
[[File:Ondersnijding.gif|thumb|left|A simple example of molding an external undercut]]
Undercut - Any indentation or protrusion in a shape that will prevent its withdrawal from a one-piece mold.

Undercuts on molded parts are features that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an [[injection molding machine]]. They are categorized into ''internal'' and ''external'' undercuts, where external undercuts are on the exterior of the part and interior undercuts are on the inside of the part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a ''[[side action]]'' or ''side pull''.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt; This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berins|Society of the Plastics Industry|1991|pp=325–326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosato|Plastics Institute of America|Schott|Rosato|2001|pp=1405–1406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the size of the undercut is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of [[stripper pin]]s so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Milling==
[[File:Undercut machining.png|thumb|400px|An example of a machining undercut]]

In milling the corners may be undercut to remove the radius that is usually left by the [[milling cutter]]. Examples of this use are linear bearings for square shafts (i.e. [[rack and pinion|racks]]) and machined hexalobular sockets.

{{clear}}

==Etching==
[[File:Etch anisotropy.png|thumb|left|upright|{{ordered list |An isotropic etchant that creates an undercut |An anisotropic etchant leaves no undercut}}]]
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}

Undercuts from etching are somewhat different than the undercuts explained above, because it is a side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the [[Chemical milling|etchant]] was applied too long. The second is due to an [[isotropic]] etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an [[anisotropic]] etchant is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Welding==
[[File:Welding undercut.svg|thumb]]

Undercutting is when the weld reduces the cross-sectional thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces the strength of the weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression along the length of the weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough [[filler metal]] along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater [[temperature gradient]]s between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rampaul|2003|pp=211–212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Janssens Elinga - Reading Woman - WGA7482.jpg|thumb|Elinga, ''Reading Woman,'' c. 1660]]
'''Women reading in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying one or more women in the act of reading. This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conlon|first=James|year=2005|title=Men Reading Women Reading: Interpreting Images of Women Readers|jstor=4137395|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=26|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. ''Reading Woman'' (c.1660) by [[Pieter Janssens Elinga|Pieter Janssans Elinga]] portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity.

Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, then, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Depictions of woman readers ==

[[File:Antoine_Wiertz_La_liseuse_de_romans.jpg|thumb|Antoine Wiertz, ''The Reader of Novels,'' c. 1853]]
During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Reader|last=Jack|first=Belinda|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=228–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties.  Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in [[Antoine Wiertz|Antoine Wiert's]]''The Reader of Novels'' (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Claude_Monet_-_Springtime_-_Walters_3711.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', c. 1872]]
In [[Dutch Golden Age]] painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. [[Johannes Vermeer]], for example, created numerous works around this subject, including ''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter|A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]''. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/teaching-packets/pdfs/dutch_painting.pdf|title=Painting in the Dutch Golden Age: A Profile of the Seventeenth Century|last=|first=|date=2007|website=National Gallery of Art, Washington|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conlon argues, the self-relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Vermeer,_Johannes_-_Woman_reading_a_letter_-_ca._1662-1663.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'', ca. 1662-1663, [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

== Female artists and the subject of reading ==

Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''Family Group Reading'' is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
