"'''All the world's a stage'''" is the phrase that begins a [[monologue]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]'', spoken by the [[Jaques (As You Like It)|melancholy Jaques]] in Act II Scene VII Line 138. The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the '''seven ages of man''':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qqPLVyh6KLYC Shakespeare's Seven Ages of Man]. By [[William Shakespeare]]. Van Voorst, 1848. (Also, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O19WAAAAYAAJ L. Booth and S. Ayling, 1864] Version.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[infant]], [[schoolboy]], [[love]]r, [[soldier]], [[Judge|justice]], [[Pantalone]], and [[old age]], facing imminent death. It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently quoted passages.

==Text==
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;{{pad|9em}}
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Seven ages of man.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Seven Ages of Man'' by [[William Mulready]], 1838, illustrating the speech]]

===World as a stage===
The comparison of the world to a stage and people to actors long predated Shakespeare. [[Juvenal]], the ancient Roman poet, wrote one of the earliest versions of this line in his “Satire 3”: “All of Greece is a stage, and every Greek’s an actor.” &lt;ref&gt;Wender, Dorothy. “Roman Poetry: From the Republic to the Silver Age. Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1980. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Edwardes|Richard Edwards]]' play ''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'', written in the year Shakespeare was born, contains the lines, "Pythagoras said that this world was like a stage / Whereon many play their parts; the lookers-on, the sage".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams]], ''Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas: A Selection of Plays Illustrating the History of the English Drama from Its Origin down to Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston; New York, 1924, p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was founded in 1599 Shakespeare's own theatre, [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]], may have used the motto ''{{lang|la|Totus mundus agit histrionem}}'' (All the world plays the actor), the Latin text of which is derived from a 12th-century treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie B. Garber|authorlink=Marjorie Garber|title=Profiling Shakespeare|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the words derive from ''{{lang|la|quod fere totus mundus exercet histrionem}}'' (because almost the whole world are actors) attributed to [[Petronius]], a phrase which had wide circulation in England at the time.

In his own earlier work, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Shakespeare also had one of his main characters, [[Antonio (The Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]], comparing the world to a stage:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.&lt;/poem&gt;|Act I, Scene I}}

In his work ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', first printed in 1511, Renaissance humanist [[Erasmus]] asks, "For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them off the stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Masters|title=The Essential Erasmus|publisher=[[New American Library|The New American Library]]|year=1956|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ages of man===
Likewise the division of human life into a series of ages was a commonplace of art and literature, which Shakespeare would have expected his audiences to recognize. The number of ages varied: three and four being the most common among ancient writers such as [[Aristotle]]. The concept of seven ages derives from mediaeval philosophy, which constructed groups of seven, as in the [[seven deadly sins]], for theological reasons. The seven ages model dates from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. A. Burrow|title=The Ages of Man: A Study in Medieval Writing and Thought|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] had a tapestry illustrating the seven ages of man.&lt;ref&gt;''PROME'', 1423 October, item 31, entries 757–797, quoted in Ian Mortimer, ''1415 – Henry V's Year of Glory'', p. 45, footnote 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to T. W. Baldwin, Shakespeare's version of the concept of the ages of man is based primarily upon [[Palingenius]]' book ''Zodiacus Vitae'', a school text he would have studied at the Stratford Grammar School, which also enumerates stages of human life. He also takes elements from [[Ovid]] and other sources known to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Whitfield Baldwin|title=William Shakspere's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke|volume=1|location=Urbana, Ill.|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=1944|pages=652–673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Art of the United Kingdom''' refers to all forms of visual art in or associated with the United Kingdom since the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and encompass [[English art]], [[Scottish art]], [[Welsh art]] and [[Irish art]], and forms part of [[Western art history]]. During the 18th century Britain began to reclaim the leading place England had played in European art during the Middle Ages, being especially strong in portraiture and [[landscape art]]. Increasing British prosperity led to a greatly increased production of both [[fine art]] and the [[decorative arts]], the latter often being exported. The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period resulted from very diverse talents, including the painters [[William Blake]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[John Constable]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. The Victorian period saw a great diversity of art, and a far larger quantity created than before. Much Victorian art is now out of critical favour, with interest concentrated on the Pre-Raphaelites and the innovative movements at the end of the 18th century.

The training of artists, which had long been neglected, began to improve in the 18th century through private and government initiatives, and greatly expanded in the 19th. Public exhibitions and the later opening of museums brought art to a wider public, especially in London. In the 19th century publicly displayed religious art once again became popular after a virtual absence since the [[Reformation]], and, as in other countries, movements such as the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the [[Glasgow School]] contended with established [[Academic art]].

The British contribution to early [[Modernist art]] was relatively small, but since World War II British artists have made a considerable impact on [[Contemporary art]], especially with figurative work, and Britain remains a key centre of an increasingly globalized art world.

==Background==
[[File:Elizabeth I Unknown Artist 1570s.jpg|thumb|200px|Unknown artist, ''[[Portrait of Elizabeth I]]'', 1570s]] 
{{Main|English art|Irish art|Scottish art|Welsh art}}
The oldest surviving British art includes [[Stonehenge]] from around 2600 BC, and [[tin]] and [[gold]] works of art produced by the [[Beaker people]] from around 2150 BC.  The [[La Tène]] style of [[Celtic art]] reached the British Isles rather late, no earlier than about 400 BC, and developed a particular "Insular Celtic" style seen in objects such as the [[Battersea Shield]], and a number of bronze mirror-backs decorated with intricate patterns of curves, spirals and trumpet-shapes.  Only in the British Isles can Celtic decorative style be seen to have survived throughout the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], as shown in objects like the [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] and the resurgence of Celtic motifs, now blended with Germanic [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and Mediterranean elements, in Christian [[Insular art]].  This had a brief but spectacular flowering in all the countries that now form the United Kingdom in the 7th and 8th centuries, in works such as the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]].  The Insular style was influential across Northern Europe, and especially so in later [[Anglo-Saxon art]], although this received new Continental influences.

The English contribution to [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]] was considerable, especially in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and monumental sculpture for churches, though the other countries were now essentially provincial, and in the 15th century Britain struggled to keep up with developments in painting on the Continent.  A few examples of top-quality English painting on walls or panel from before 1500 have survived, including the [[Westminster Retable]], [[The Wilton Diptych]] and some survivals from paintings in [[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 9–120, or see the references at the linked articles&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]]s of [[English Reformation|England]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Scotland]] were especially destructive of existing religious art, and the production of new work virtually ceased.  The [[Artists of the Tudor Court]] were mostly imported from Europe, setting a pattern that would continue until the 18th century.  The [[portraiture of Elizabeth I]] ignored contemporary European Renaissance models to create iconic images that border on [[naive art]].  The portraitists [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]] were the most distinguished and influential of a large number of artists who spent extended periods in Britain, generally eclipsing local talents like [[Nicolas Hilliard]], the painter of [[portrait miniature]]s, [[Robert Peake the elder]], [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]], [[William Dobson]], and [[John Michael Wright]], a Scot who mostly worked in London.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapters 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape painting was as yet little developed in Britain at the time of the Union, but a tradition of [[marine art]] had been established by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]] both called Willem van de Velde, who had been the leading Dutch maritime painters until they moved to London in 1673, in the middle of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 18th century==
[[File:William Hogarth 004.jpg|thumb|320px|William Hogarth, ''[[The Bench (Hogarth)|The Bench]]'', 1758]]
The so-called [[Acts of Union 1707]] came in the middle of the long period of domination in London of Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], a German portraitist who had eventually succeeded as principal court painter the Dutch Sir [[Peter Lely]], whose style he had adopted for his enormous and formulaic output, of greatly varying quality, which was itself repeated by an army of lesser painters.  His counterpart in Edinburgh, Sir [[John Baptist Medina]], born in Brussels to Spanish parents, had died just before the Union took place, and was one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created.  Medina had first worked in London, but in mid-career moved to the less competitive environment of Edinburgh, where he dominated portraiture of the Scottish elite.  However, after the Union the movement was to be all in the other direction, and Scottish aristocrats resigned themselves to paying more to have their portraits painted in London, even if by Scottish painters such as Medina's pupil [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]], who moved down in 1723, or [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 138–139; 151; 163&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an alternative, more direct, tradition in British portraiture to that of Lely and Kneller, tracing back to William Dobson and the German or Dutch [[Gerard Soest]], who trained [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], to whom only a few works are firmly attributed and who in turn trained [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]], a fine artist who trained [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]] who trained Joshua Reynolds and Joseph Wright of Derby.  Richardson also trained the most notable Irish portraitist of the period, [[Charles Jervas]] who enjoyed social and financial success in London despite his clear limitations as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 135–138; 147–150&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to the dominance of the "[[hierarchy of genres|lower genres]]" of painting was Sir [[James Thornhill]] (1675/76–1734) who was the first and last significant English painter of huge [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] allegorical decorative schemes, and the first native painter to be knighted.  His best-known work is at [[Old Royal Naval College|Greenwich Hospital]], [[Blenheim Palace]] and the [[cupola]] of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]].  His drawings show a taste for strongly drawn realism in the direction his son-in-law [[William Hogarth]] was to pursue, but this is largely overridden in the finished works, and for Greenwich he took to heart his careful list of "Objections that will arise from the plain representation of [[Glorious Revolution#Invasion|the King's landing]] as it was in fact and in the modern way and dress" and painted a conventional Baroque glorification.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 131–133. The "objections" included that it was a dark night, the boat was small, the king not smartly dressed, and many of the nobles who accompanied him were by then out of favour.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Hogarth, he played the nationalist card in promoting himself, and eventually beat [[Sebastiano Ricci]] to enough commissions that in 1716 he and his team retreated to France, [[Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini]] having already left in 1713.  Once the other leading foreign painters of allegoric schemes, [[Antonio Verrio]] and [[Louis Laguerre]], had died in 1707 and 1721 respectively, Thornhill had the field to himself, although by the end of his life commissions for grand schemes had dried up from changes in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 132–133; Pevsner, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1714 the new [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] conducted a far less ostentatious court, and largely withdrew from patronage of the arts, other than the necessary portraits.  Fortunately, the booming British economy was able to supply aristocratic and mercantile wealth to replace the court, above all in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 358-361&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Gate of Calais]]'', an anti-French satire by [[William Hogarth]], 1748]]

[[William Hogarth]] was a great presence in the second quarter of the century, whose art was successful in achieving a particular English character, with vividly moralistic scenes of contemporary life, full of both satire and pathos, attuned to the tastes and prejudices of the Protestant middle-class, who bought the [[engraving|engraved]] versions of his paintings in huge numbers. Other subjects were only issued as prints, and Hogarth was both the first significant British printmaker, and still the best known.  Many works were series of four or more scenes, of which the best known are: ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' from the 1730s and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' from the mid-1740s.  In fact, although he only once briefly left England and his own propaganda asserted his Englishness and often attacked the [[Old Master]]s, his background in [[printmaking]], more closely aware of Continental art than most British painting, and apparently his ability to quickly absorb lessons from other painters, meant that he was more aware of, and made more use of, Continental art than most of his contemporaries.

Like many later painters Hogarth wanted above all to achieve success at [[history painting]] in the [[Grand Manner]], but his few attempts were not successful and are now little regarded. His portraits were mostly of middle-class sitters shown with an apparent realism that reflected both sympathy and flattery, and included some in the fashionable form of the [[conversation piece]], recently introduced from France by [[Philippe Mercier]], which was to remain a favourite in Britain, taken up by artists such as [[Francis Hayman]], though usually abandoned once an artist could get good single figure commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 165; 168–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teekanne Courtauld.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver teapot by Samuel Courtauld, London, 1748–49]]
There was a recognition that, even more than the rest of Europe given the lack of British artists, the training of artists needed to be extended beyond the workshop of established masters, and various attempts were made to set up [[academies]], starting with Kneller in 1711, with the help of Pellegrini, in Great Queen Street.  The academy was taken over by Thornhill in 1716, but seems to have become inactive by the time [[John Vanderbank]] and [[Louis Chéron]] set up their own academy in 1720.  This did not last long, and in 1724/5 Thornhill tried again in his own house, with little success. Hogarth inherited the equipment for this, and used it to start the [[St. Martin's Lane Academy]] in 1735, which was the most enduring, eventually being absorbed by the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.  Hogarth also helped solve the problem of a lack of exhibition venues in London, arranging for shows at the [[Foundling Hospital]] from 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish portraitist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] worked in Edinburgh before moving to London by 1739.  He made visits of three years to Italy at the beginning and end of his career, and anticipated [[Joshua Reynolds]] in bringing a more relaxed version of "Grand Manner" to British portraiture, combined with very sensitive handling in his best work, which is generally agreed to have been of female sitters.  His main London rival in the mid-century, until Reynolds made his reputation, was Reynold's master, the stodgy [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wootton]], active from about 1714 to his death in 1765, was the leading sporting painter of his day, based in the capital of English [[horse racing]] at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also battle scenes and conversation pieces with a [[fox hunting|hunting]] or riding setting.  He had begun life as a page to the family of the [[Dukes of Beaufort]], who in the 1720s sent him to Rome, where he acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of [[Gaspard Dughet]] and [[Claude Lorraine|Claude]], which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects.  This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as [[George Lambert (English painter)|George Lambert]], the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]] was the best of the native marine and townscape artists, though in the latter specialization he could not match the visiting [[Canaletto]], who was in England from nine years from 1746, and whose Venetian views were a favourite souvenir of the [[Grand Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 153–154, 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[antiquary]] and engraver [[George Vertue]] was a figure in the London art scene for most of the period, and his copious notebooks were adapted and published in the 1760s by [[Horace Walpole]] as ''Some Anecdotes of Painting in England'', which remains a principal source for the period.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

From his arrival in London in 1720, the Flemish sculptor [[John Michael Rysbrack]] was the leader in his field until the arrival in 1730 of [[Louis-François Roubiliac]] who had a [[Rococo]] style which was highly effective in busts and small figures, though by the following decade he was also commissioned for larger works.  He also produced models for the [[Chelsea porcelain factory]] founded in 1743, a private enterprise which sought to compete with Continental factories mostly established by rulers. Roubiliac's style formed that of the leading native sculptor [[Sir Henry Cheere, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Cheere]], and his [[John Cheere|brother John]] who specialized in statues for gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Snowdin, 278-287, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong London [[silversmithing]] trade was dominated by the descendants of [[Huguenot]] refugees like [[Paul de Lamerie]], [[Paul Crespin]], [[Nicholas Sprimont]], and the [[Louisa Courtauld|Courtauld family]], as well as [[Georges Wickes]].  Orders were received from as far away as the courts of Russia and Portugal, though English styles were still led by Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 100–106&lt;/ref&gt;  The manufacture of [[silk]] at [[Spitalfields]] in London was also a traditional Huguenot business, but from the late 1720s silk design was dominated by the surprising figure of [[Anna Maria Garthwaite]], a parson's daughter from [[Lincolnshire]] who emerged at the age of 40 as a designer of largely floral patterns in Rococo styles.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in France and Germany, the English adoption of the Rococo style was patchy rather than whole-hearted, and there was resistance to it on nationalist grounds, led by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] and [[William Kent]], who promoted styles in interior design and furniture to match the [[Palladianism]] of the architecture they produced together, also beginning the influential British tradition of the [[landscape garden]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), Chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] "the most influential of all English innovations in art".&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  The French-born engraver [[Hubert-François Gravelot]], in London from 1732 to 1745, was a key figure in importing Rococo taste in book illustrations and ornament prints for craftsmen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 15–17; 29–31 and throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern popular mind, English art from about 1750–1790 — today referred to as the "classical age" of English painting — was dominated by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1723–1792), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] (1727–1788) and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1734–1797).   At the time Reynolds was considered the dominant figure, Gainsborough was very highly reputed, but Stubbs was seen as a mere painter of animals and viewed as far a less significant figure than many other painters that are today little-known or forgotten. The period saw continued rising prosperity for Britain and British artists: "By the 1780s English painters were among the wealthiest men in the country, their names familiar to newspaper readers, their quarrels and cabals the talk of the town, their subjects known to everyone from the displays in the print-shop windows", according to [[Gerald Reitlinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 58 (quote), 59-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds returned from a long visit to Italy in 1753, and very quickly established a reputation as the most fashionable London portraitist, and before long as a formidable figure in society;, the public leader of the arts in Britain. He had studied both classical and modern Italian art, and his compositions discreetly re-use models seen on his travels. He could convey a wide range of moods and emotions, whether heroic military men or very young women, and often to unite background and figure in a dramatic way.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 217-230&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]], ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'', 1768]]
The [[Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] had been founded in 1754, principally to provide a location for exhibitions. In 1761 Reynolds was a leader in founding the rival [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], where the artists had more control.  This continued until 1791, despite the founding of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768, which immediately became both the most important exhibiting organization and the most important school in London.  Reynolds was its first President, holding the office until his death in 1792.  His published ''Discourses'', first delivered to the students, were regarded as the first major writing on art in English, and set out the aspiration for a style to match the classical grandeur of classical sculpture and [[High Renaissance]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165, 225–227, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Academy was established, Reynolds' portraits became more overly classicizing, and often more distant, until in the late 1770s he returned to a more intimate style, perhaps influenced by the success of [[Thomas Gainsborough]],&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 227-230&lt;/ref&gt; who only settled in London in 1773, after working in [[Ipswich]] and then [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].  While Reynolds' practice of aristocratic portraits seem exactly matched to his talents, Gainsborough, if not forced to follow the market for his work, might well have developed as a pure landscape painter, or a portraitist in the informal style of many of his portraits of his family.  He continued to paint pure landscapes for, largely for pleasure until his later years; full recognition of his landscapes came only in the 20th century. His main influences were French in his portraits and Dutch in his landscapes, rather than Italian, and he is famous for the brilliant light touch of his brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapter 18; Piper, 54-56; Mellon, 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] also became prominent in about 1770 and was active until 1799, though with a falling-off in his last years.  His portraits are mostly characterful but flattering images of dignified society figures, but he developed an obsession with the flighty young [[Emma Hamilton]] from 1781, painting her about sixty times in more extravagant poses.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 306-311&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was especially sought-after by American collectors in the early 20th century and many are now in American museums.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84; Reitlinger, 434-437 with the remarkable numbers&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the period this generation had been succeeded by younger portraitists including [[John Hoppner]], [[Sir William Beechey]] and the young [[Gilbert Stuart]], who only realized his mature style after he returned to America.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh painter [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] returned to London from seven years in Italy in 1757, and over the next two decades developed a "sublime" landscape style adapting the Franco-Italian tradition of Claude and Gaspard Dughet to British subjects.  Though much admired, like those of Gainsborough his landscapes were hard to sell, and he sometimes resorted, as Reynolds complained, to the common strategem of turning them into [[history painting]]s by adding a few small figures, which doubled their price to about £80.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75; Waterhouse, 232-241&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to paint scenes set in Italy, as well as England and Wales, and his death in 1782 came just as large numbers of artists began to travel to Wales, and later the [[Lake District]] and Scotland in search of mountainous views, both for oil paintings and [[watercolour]]s which were now starting their long period of popularity in Britain, both with professionals and amateurs. [[Paul Sandby]], [[Francis Towne]], [[John Warwick Smith]], and [[John Robert Cozens]] were among the leading specialist painters and the clergyman and amateur artist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] was an important writer who stimulated the popularity of amateur painting of the [[picturesque]], while the works of [[Alexander Cozens]] recommended forming random ink blots into landscape compositions—even Constable tried this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|[[John Singleton Copley]], ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778)]]
[[History painting]] in the grand manner continued to be the most prestigious form of art, though not the easiest to sell, and Reynolds made several attempts at it, as unsuccessful as Hogarth's.  The unheroic nature of modern dress was seen as a major obstacle in the depiction of contemporary scenes, and the Scottish gentleman-artist and art dealer [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] preferred classical scenes as well as painting some based on his Eastern travels, where his European figures by-passed the problem by wearing Arab dress.  He spent most of his adult life based in Rome and had at least as much influence on [[Neo-Classicism]] in Europe as in Britain.  The Irishman [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] was an influence on Blake but had a difficult career, and spent years on his cycle ''The Progress of Human Culture'' in the Great Room of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  The most successful history painters, who were not afraid of buttons and wigs, were both Americans settled in London: [[Benjamin West]] and [[John Singleton Copley]], though one of his most successful works ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) was able to mostly avoid them, showing a rescue from drowning.  Smaller scale subjects from literature were also popular, pioneered by [[Francis Hayman]], one of the first to paint scenes from [[Shakespeare]], and [[Joseph Highmore]], with a series illustrating the novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''.  At the end of the period the [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]] was an ambitious project for paintings, and prints after them, illustrating "the Bard", as he had now become, and exposing the limitations of contemporary English history painting.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 478-479; Waterhouse, Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] was mainly a portrait painter who also was one of the first artists to depict the [[Industrial Revolution]], as well as developing a cross between the conversation piece and history painting in works like ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) and ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' (c. 1766), which like many of his works are lit only by candlelight, giving a strong [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 332-342; Waterhouse, 285-289&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Blake - Nebuchadnezzar (Tate Britain).jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[William Blake]], ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'', after 1795]]
Paintings recording scenes from the theatre were another subgenre, painted by the German [[Johann Zoffany]] among others. Zoffany painted portraits and conversation pieces, who also spent over two years in India, painting the English [[Nawab#Nabob|nabobs]] and local scenes, and the expanding [[British Empire]] played an increasing role in British art.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 315-322&lt;/ref&gt;  Training in art was considered a useful skill in the military for sketch maps and plans, and many British officers made the first Western images, often in watercolour, of scenes and places around the world.  In India, the [[Company style]] developed as a hybrid form between Western and [[Indian art]], produced by Indians for a British market.

[[Thomas Rowlandson]] produced watercolours and prints satirizing British life, but mostly avoided politics. The master of the political [[caricature]], sold individually by print shops (often acting as publishers also), either hand-coloured or plain, was [[James Gillray]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on portrait-painting in British art was not entirely due to the vanity of the sitters. There was a large collector's market for portrait prints, mostly reproductions of paintings, which were often mounted in albums. From the mid-century there was a great growth in the expensive but more effective reproductions in [[mezzotint]], of portraits and other paintings, with special demand from collectors for early proof states "before letter" (that is, before the inscriptions were added), which the printmakers obligingly printed off in growing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 49, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

This period marked one of the high points in British decorative arts. Around the mid-century many [[porcelain]] factories opened, including [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]] in London, and in the provinces [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]], [[Royal Worcester|Worcester]], [[Royal Crown Derby]], [[Liverpool porcelain|Liverpool]], and [[Wedgwood]], with [[Spode]] following in 1767. Most were started as small concerns, with some lasting only a few decades while others still survive today.  By the end of the period British porcelain services were being commissioned by foreign royalty and the British manufacturers were especially adept at pursuing the rapidly expanding international middle-class market, developing [[bone china]] and [[transfer-print]]ed wares as well as hand-painted true porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;snowdin, 236–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The three leading furniture makers, [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1718–1779), [[Thomas Sheraton]] (1751–1806) and [[George Hepplewhite]] (1727?–1786) had varied styles and have achieved the lasting fame they have mainly as the authors of pattern books used by other makers in Britain and abroad.  In fact it is far from clear if the last two named ever ran actual workshops, though Chippendale certainly was successful in this and in what we now call interior design; unlike France Britain had abandoned its [[guild]] system, and Chippendale was able to employ specialists in all the crafts needed to complete a redecoration.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 154–157&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period Rococo and [[Chinoiserie]] gave way to [[Neo-Classicism]], with the Scottish architect and interior designer [[Robert Adam]] (1728–1792) leading the new style.

==19th century and the Romantics==
[[File:Samuel_Palmer_-_Self-Portrait_-_WGA16951.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Samuel Palmer]], ''Self-portrait, c. 1826]]
The late 18th century and the early 19th century characterized by the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in British art includes [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], [[James Ward (artist)|James Ward]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and was perhaps the most radical period in British art, also producing [[William Blake]] (1757–1827), [[John Constable]] (1776–1837) and [[J.M.W. Turner]] (1775–1851), the later two being arguably the most internationally influential of all British artists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6214553/JMW-Turners-feud-with-John-Constable-unveiled-at-Tate-Britain.html Stephen Adams, The Telegraph, September 22, 2009, ''JMW Turner's feud with John Constable unveiled at Tate Britain''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6843533.ece Jack Malvern, The Sunday Times, September 22, 2009, ''Tate Britain exhibition revives Turner and Constable’s old rivalry''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's style, based on the Italianate tradition although he never saw Italy until in his forties, passed through considerable changes before his final wild, almost abstract, landscapes that explored the effects of light, and were a profound influence on the [[Impressionists]] and other later movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turner/gallery3d.htm Tate Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Constable normally painted pure landscapes with at most a few genre figures, in a style based on Northern European traditions, but, like Turner, his "six-footers" were intended to make as striking an impact as any history painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/constableinfo.shtm ''Constable's Great Landscapes: The Six-Foot Paintings,'' National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were carefully prepared using studies and full-size [[oil sketch]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 161–164; Mellon, 134; [http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate 2006 Constable exhibition] Tate Britain feature.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Turner was notorious for finishing his exhibition pieces when they were already hanging for show, freely adjusting them to dominate the surrounding works in the tightly-packed hangs of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's visionary style was a minority taste in his lifetime, but influenced the younger group of "[[Ancients (art group)|Ancients]]" of Samuel Palmer, [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]] and [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], who gathered in the country at [[Shoreham, Kent]] in the 1820s, producing intense and lyrical pastoral idylls in conditions of some poverty.  They went on to more conventional artistic careers and Palmer's early work was entirely forgotten until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; Blake and Palmer became a significant influence on modernist artists of the 20th century seen (among others) in the painting of British artists such as [[Dora Carrington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BCduKb-ujO8C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=dora+carrington+and+blake&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zRujez6ton&amp;sig=5KCIez-7s2JfE4aPdpmj2vihl3U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bu3_TMzQNoGdlgfi2aHNCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dora%20carrington%20and%20blake&amp;f=false Dictionary of women artists] Retrieved 8 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker.

[[Thomas Lawrence]] was already a leading portraitist by the start of the 20th century, and able to give a Romantic dash to his portraits of high society, and the leaders of Europe gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Henry Raeburn]] was the most significant portraitist since the Union to remain based in Edinburgh throughout his career, an indication of increasing Scottish prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 96-98; Waterhouse, 330&lt;/ref&gt;  But [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] took the traditional road south, achieving great success with subjects of country life and hybrid [[genre painting|genre]] and history scenes such as ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Flaxman]] was the most thorough-going neo-classical English artist. Beginning as a sculptor, he became best known for his many spare "outline drawings" of classical scenes, often illustrating literature, which were reproduced as prints.  These imitated the effects of the classical-style reliefs he also produced.  The German-Swiss [[Henry Fuseli]] also produced work in a linear graphic style, but his narrative scenes, often from English literature, were intensely Romantic and highly dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian art==
{{main|Victorian painting}}
[[File:Millais - Überfahrt nach Nordwest.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Everett Millais]], ''[[The North-West Passage]]'' (1878)]]

The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] (PRB) achieved considerable influence after its foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and [[genre]] subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style, rejecting the loose painterly brushwork of the tradition represented by "Sir Sloshua" Reynolds.  PRB artists included [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Ford Madox Brown]] (never officially a member), and figures such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[John William Waterhouse]] were later much influenced by aspects of their ideas, as was the designer [[William Morris]]. Morris advocated a return to hand-craftsmanship in the decorative arts over the industrial manufacture that was rapidly being applied to all crafts. His efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs defining the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] aesthetic and instigating the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].

The Pre-Raphaelites, like Turner, were supported by the authoritative art critic [[John Ruskin]], himself a fine amateur artist. For all their technical innovation, they were both traditional and Victorian in their adherence to the [[history painting]] as the [[Hierarchy of genres|highest form of art]], and their subject matter was thoroughly in tune with Victorian taste, and indeed "everything that the publishers of steel engravings welcomed",&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 97&lt;/ref&gt; enabling them to merge easily into the mainstream in their later careers.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 139–146; Wilson, 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leighton of Stretton, Frederick Leighton, Baron - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Lord Leighton]], 1855, ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's celebrated Madonna is carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'', 222 × 521 cm]]

While the Pre-Raphaelites had a turbulent and divided reception, the most popular and expensive painters of the period included [[Edwin Landseer]], who specialized in sentimental animal subjects, which were favourites of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. In the later part of the century artists could earn large sums from selling the reproduction rights of their paintings to print publishers, and works of Landseer, especially his ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1851), a portrait of a Highland stag, were among the most popular. Like Millais' ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' (1886) it was used on packaging and advertisements for decades, for brands of whisky and soap respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 149; Strong (1999), 540–541; Reitlinger, 97–99, 148–151 and elsewhere; he has detail throughout on reproduction rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late Victorian era in Britain the academic paintings, some enormously large, of [[Lord Leighton]] and the Dutch-born [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were enormously popular, both often featuring lightly clad beauties in exotic or classical settings, while the allegorical works of [[George Frederic Watts|G.F. Watts]] matched the Victorian sense of high purpose.  The classical ladies of [[Edward Poynter]] and [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] wore more clothes and met with rather less success.

[[William Powell Frith]] painted highly detailed scenes of social life, typically including all classes of society, that include comic and moral elements and have an acknowledged debt to Hogarth, though tellingly different from his work.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 85; Bills, Mark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8IPhEUcc3YC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Frith and the Influence of Hogarth''], in ''William Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age'', by Mark Bills &amp; [[Vivien Knight]], Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-12190-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all such artists the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] was an essential platform, reviewed at huge length in the press, which often alternated ridicule and extravagant praise in discussing works.  The ultimate, and very rare, accolade was when a rail had to be put in front of a painting to protect it from the eager crowd; up to 1874 this had only happened to Wilkie's ''[[Chelsea Pensioners]]'', Frith's ''[[The Derby Day]]'' and ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' and Luke Filde's ''[[The Casual Ward]]'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 157; Wilson, 85; Frith's ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' (1871), now [[Providence, Rhode Island]], is Frith's last great panorama, of the gambling at [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Homburg]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcnf5aTOkyEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;l].&lt;/ref&gt;  A great number of artists laboured year after year in the hope of a hit there, often working in manners to which their talent was not really suited, a trope exemplified by the suicide in 1846 of [[Benjamin Haydon]], a friend of [[Keats]] and [[Dickens]] and a better writer than painter, leaving his blood splashed over his unfinished ''King Alfred and the First British Jury''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

British history was a very common subject, with the Middle Ages, Elizabeth I, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and the [[English Civil War]] especially popular sources for subjects.  Many painters mentioned elsewhere painted historical subjects, including Millais (''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' and many others), Ford Madox Brown (''[[Cromwell on his Farm]]''), David Wilkie, Watts and Frith, and West, Bonington and Turner in earlier decades.  The London-based Irishman [[Daniel Maclise]] and [[Charles West Cope]] painted scenes for the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. [[Lady Jane Grey]] was, like Mary Queen of Scots, a female whose sufferings attracted many painters, though none quite matched ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', one of many British historical subjects by the Frenchman [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), throughout. See Appendix I for a revealing full listing of pictures shown at the RA 1769–1904, analysed by subject&lt;/ref&gt;  Painters prided themselves on the increasing accuracy of their period settings in terms of costume and objects, studying the collections of the new [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and books, and scorning the breezy approximations of earlier generations of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), 47-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Redgrave - The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home.JPG|thumb|[[Richard Redgrave]], ''The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home'', 1858]]
Victorian painting developed the Hogarthian social subject, packed with moralizing detail, and the tradition of illustrating scenes from literature, into a range of types of genre painting, many with only a few figures, others large and crowded scenes like Frith's best-known works.  Holman Hunt's ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' (1853) and [[Augustus Egg]]'s set of ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'' (1858) are of the first type, both dealing with "fallen women", a perennial Victorian concern.  As [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]] points out, these were paintings designed to be read like novels, whose meaning emerged after the viewer had done the work of deciphering it.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Peter. ''The Victorian Treasure House''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other "anecdotal" scenes were lighter in mood, tending towards being captionless ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons.

Towards the end of the 19th century the [[problem picture]] left the details of the narrative action deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to speculate on it using the evidence in front of them, but not supplying a final answer (artists learned to smile enigmatically when asked).  This sometimes provoked discussion on sensitive social issues, typically involving women, that might have been hard to raise directly.  They were enormously popular; newspapers ran competitions for readers to supply the meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Orientalism]], though not as common as in France at the same period, had many specialists, including [[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for nine years in [[Cairo]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], a Scot who made lithographs of his travels in the Middle East and Italy, the nonsense writer [[Edward Lear]], a continual traveller who reached as far as [[Ceylon]], and [[Richard Dadd]]. Holman Hunt also travelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to obtain authentic settings for his Biblical pictures.  The Frenchman [[James Tissot]], who fled to London after the fall of the [[Paris Commune]], divided his time between scenes of high society social events and a huge series of Biblical illustrations, made in watercolour for reproductive publication.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 148–151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Goodall]] specialized in scenes of Ancient Egypt.

[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'' (1874). A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."

Larger paintings concerned with the social conditions of the poor tended to concentrate on rural scenes, so that the misery of the human figures was at least offset by a landscape.  Painters of these included [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Luke Fildes]] (although he made his name in 1874 with ''[[Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward]]''- see above), [[Frank Holl]], [[George Clausen]], and the German [[Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 89-91; Rosenthal, 144, 160–162; Reitlinger, 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bell Scott]], a friend of the Rossettis, painted historical scenes and other types of work, but was also one of the few artists to depict scenes from heavy industry. His memoirs are a useful source for the period, and he was one of several artists to be employed for a period in the greatly expanded system of government art schools, which were driven by the administrator [[Henry Cole]] (the inventor of the [[Christmas card]]) and employed [[Richard Redgrave]], [[Edward Poynter]], [[Richard Burchett]], the Scottish designer [[Christopher Dresser]] and many others.  Burchett was headmaster of the "South Kensington Schools", now the [[Royal College of Art]], which gradually replaced the Royal Academy School as the leading British art school, though around the start of the 20th century the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] produced many of the forward-looking artists.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, 12-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy was initially by no means as conservative and restrictive as the [[Paris Salon]], and the Pre-Raphaelites had most of their submissions for exhibition accepted, although like everyone else they complained about the positions their paintings were given.  They were especially welcomed at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]], one of the largest regional exhibiting organizations; the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] was founded in 1826 and opened its [[Royal Scottish Academy Building|grand new building]] in the 1850s.  There were alternative London locations like the [[British Institution]], and as the conservatism of the Royal Academy gradually increased, despite the efforts of [[Lord Leighton]] when President, new spaces opened, notably the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in [[Bond Street]], from 1877, which became the home of the Aesthetic Movement. The [[New English Art Club]] exhibited from 1885 many artists with Impressionist tendencies, initially using the [[Egyptian Hall]], opposite the Royal Academy, which also hosted many exhibitions of foreign art. The American portrait painter [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856–1925), spent most of his working career in Europe and he maintained his studio in London (where he died) from 1886 to 1907.

[[Alfred Sisley]], who was French by birth but had British nationality, painted in France as one of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]; [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] at the start of their careers were also strongly influenced, but despite the dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] bringing many exhibitions to London, the movement made little impact in England until decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 57-62; Wilson, 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;  Some members of the [[Newlyn School]] of landscapes and genre scenes adopted a quasi-Impressionist technique while others used realist or more traditional levels of finish.

The late 19th century also saw the [[Decadent movement]] in France and the British [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic movement]]. The British-based American painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]], and the former [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are associated with those movements, with late Burne-Jones and Beardsley both being admired abroad and representing the nearest British approach to European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 James McNeill Whistler, sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref name="blogs.princeton.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; The jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler but awarded him only a single farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Lisa N., ''James McNeil Whistler'', pp. 51-52, {{ISBN|1-880908-70-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence ("The White House" in [[Tite Street]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], designed with [[Edward William Godwin|E. W. Godwin]], 1877–8), bankrupted Whistler by May 1879,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's See The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112539/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's |date=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stansky's review of Linda Merill's ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin'' in the ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 24, No. 3  (Winter, 1994), pp. 536-537 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206692]&lt;/ref&gt; notes the irony that the [[Fine Art Society|Fine Art Society of London]], which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's legal costs, supported him in etching [[The Stones of Venice (book)|"the stones of Venice"]] (and in exhibiting the series in 1883) which helped recoup Whistler's costs.

Scottish art was now regaining an adequate home market, allowing it to develop a distinctive character, of which the "[[Glasgow Boys]]" were one expression, straddling [[Impressionism]] in painting, and [[Art Nouveau]], [[Japonism]] and the [[Celtic Revival]] in design, with the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] now their best-known member.  Painters included [[Thomas Millie Dow]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]], [[Joseph Crawhall III|Joseph Crawhall]] and [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]].

New printing technology brought a great expansion in book illustration with illustrations for [[children's books]] providing much of the best remembered work of the period. Specialized artists included [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and, from 1902, [[Beatrix Potter]].

The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the [[British Empire]], led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="taste"/&gt; [[British people]] used their art "to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world", whilst the permanent settlers in [[British North America]], [[Australasia]], and South Africa "embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity".&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/art/artandempire.htm|title=Art and Empire|publisher=britishempire.co.uk|accessdate=24 October 2008|last=McKenzie|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire has been "at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art".&lt;ref name="empire3"&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous variety and massive production of the various forms of British decorative art during the period are too complex to be easily summarized.  Victorian taste, until the various movements of the last decades, such as [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]], is generally poorly regarded today, but much fine work was produced, and much money made.  Both [[William Burges]] and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]] were architects committed to the [[Gothic Revival]], who expanded into designing furniture, metalwork, tiles and objects in other media. There was an enormous boom in re-Gothicising the fittings of medieval churches, and fitting out new ones in the style, especially with [[stained glass]], an [[British and Irish stained glass (1811–1918)|industry revived from effective extinction]].  The revival of furniture painted with images was a particular feature at the top end of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style07a/index.html Gothic Revival] Feature from the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From its opening in 1875 the London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]] was especially associated with imported Far Eastern decorative items and British goods in the new styles of the end of the 19th century. [[Charles Voysey (architect)|Charles Voysey]] was an architect who also did much design work in textiles, wallpaper furniture and other media, bringing the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] into [[Art Nouveau]] and beyond; he continued to design into the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O73429/wallpaper-print-the-saladin/.html Voysey wallpaper]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, V&amp;A Museum&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. H. Mackmurdo]] was a similar figure.

==20th century==
[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|[[Graham Sutherland]], ''The City a fallen lift shaft'' (1941)]]
In many respects, the Victorian era continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the Royal Academy became increasingly ossified; the unmistakably late Victorian figure of [[Frank Dicksee]] was appointed President in 1924. In photography [[Pictorialism]] aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; [[The Linked Ring]] contained the leading practitioners.  The American [[John Singer Sargent]] was the most successful London portraitist at the start of the 20th century, with [[John Lavery]], [[Augustus John]] and [[William Orpen]] rising figures.  John's sister [[Gwen John]] lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death.  British attitudes to [[modern art]] were "polarized" at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittle et al|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernist]] movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; [[Impressionism]] was initially regarded by "many conservative critics" as a "subversive foreign influence", but became "fully assimilated" into British art during the early-20th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"/&gt; The Irish artist [[Jack Butler Yeats]] (1871–1957), was based in Dublin, at once a [[Romanticism|romantic painter]], a [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist]] and an [[Expressionism|expressionist]].

[[Vorticism]] was a brief coming together of a number of [[Modernist]] artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included [[Wyndham Lewis]], the sculptor [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Malcolm Arbuthnot]], [[Lawrence Atkinson]], the American photographer [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Etchells]], the French sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Cuthbert Hamilton]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]], [[Edward Wadsworth]], [[Jessica Dismorr]], [[Helen Saunders]], and [[Dorothy Shakespear]]. The early 20th century also includes [[The Sitwells]] artistic circle and the [[Bloomsbury Group]], a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter [[Dora Carrington]], painter and [[art critic]] [[Roger Fry]], [[art critic]] [[Clive Bell]], painter [[Vanessa Bell]], painter [[Duncan Grant]] among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 127–129; Mellon, 182–186&lt;/ref&gt; British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as [[Ben Nicholson]] kept in touch with European developments.

[[Walter Sickert]] and the [[Camden Town Group]] developed an English style of Impressionism and [[Post-Impressionism]] with a strong strand of social documentary, including [[Harold Gilman]], [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Frederick Gore]], [[Charles Ginner]], [[Robert Bevan]], [[Malcolm Drummond]] and [[Lucien Pissarro]] (the son of French Impressionist painter [[Camille Pissarro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=59 Camden Town Group, Tate] Retrieved 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where their colouring is often notoriously drab, the [[Scottish Colourists]] indeed mostly used bright light and colour; some, like [[Samuel Peploe]] and [[John Duncan Fergusson]], were living in France to find suitable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=265 Scottish Colourists, Tate] Retrieved 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially inspired by Sir [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910), a Scottish landscape painter associated with Impressionism.
 
The reaction to the horrors of the First World War prompted a return to pastoral subjects as represented by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Eric Ravilious]], mainly a printmaker. [[Stanley Spencer]] painted mystical works, as well as landscapes, and the sculptor, printmaker and [[typographer]] [[Eric Gill]] produced elegant simple forms in a style related to [[Art Deco]]. The [[Euston Road School]] was a group of "progressive" realists of the late 1930s, including the influential teacher [[William Coldstream]]. [[Surrealism]], with artists including [[John Tunnard]] and the [[Birmingham Surrealists]], was briefly popular in the 1930s, influencing [[Roland Penrose]] and [[Henry Moore]]. [[Stanley William Hayter]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaking|printmaker]] associated in the 1930s with [[Surrealism]] and from 1940 onward with [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley William Hayter (1901 − 1989) |url=http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |work=Art Collection |publisher=British Council |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715104006/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 Hayter founded the legendary ''Atelier 17'' studio in Paris.  Since his death in 1988, it has been known as ''Atelier Contrepoint.'' Hayter became one of the most influential printmakers of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brenson | first = Michael | title = Stanley William Hayter, 86, Dies; Painter Taught Miró and Pollock | work=The New York Times |date=6 May 1988 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/06/obituaries/stanley-william-hayter-86-dies-painter-taught-miro-and-pollack.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashionable portraitists included [[Meredith Frampton]] in a hard-faced Art Deco classicism, [[Augustus John]], and Sir [[Alfred Munnings]] if horses were involved.  Munnings was President of the Royal Academy 1944–1949 and led a jeering hostility to Modernism.  The photographers of the period include [[Bill Brandt]], [[Angus McBean]] and the diarist [[Cecil Beaton]].



Henry Moore emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading sculptor, promoted alongside [[Victor Pasmore]], [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] by the [[Festival of Britain]].  The "London School" of figurative painters including [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] have received widespread international recognition,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219-225&lt;/ref&gt; while other painters such as [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]] and [[John Craxton]] are characterized as [[Neo-Romantics]]. [[Graham Sutherland]], the Romantic landscapist [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] (a prolific and popular lithographer), the sculptor [[Elisabeth Frink]], and the industrial townscapes of [[L.S. Lowry]] also contributed to the strong figurative presence in post-war British art.

[[File:LucienFreud.jpg|thumb|200px|Lucian Freud]]
According to William Grimes of ''[[The New York Times]]'' "Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like ''Girl With a White Dog'' (1951-52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter’s social facade. Ordinary people — many of them his friends — stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist’s ruthless inspection."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/arts/lucian-freud-adept-portraiture-artist-dies-at-88.html "Lucian Freud, Figurative Painter Who Redefined Portraiture, Is Dead at 88"].

==Contemporary art==
[[Postmodern art|Post-modern]], contemporary British art, particularly that of the [[Young British Artists]], has been said to be "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture&amp;nbsp;... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual [[Turner Prize]], founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary British art.  Among the beneficiaries have been several members of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBA) movement, which includes [[Damien Hirst]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], and [[Tracey Emin]], who rose to prominence after the [[Freeze (exhibition)|''Freeze'' exhibition]] of 1988, with the backing of [[Saatchi Gallery|Charles Saatchi]] and achieved international recognition with their version of [[conceptual art]]. This often featured [[Installation art|installations]], notably Hirst's [[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living|vitrine containing a preserved shark]]. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi's generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of [[Jay Jopling]], the most influential London gallerist.

The [[Sensation (art exhibition)|''Sensation'' exhibition]] of works from the Saatchi Collection was controversial in both the UK and the US, though in different ways.  At the Royal Academy press-generated controversy centred on ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', a very large image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]], but when the show travelled to New York City, opening at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in late 1999, it was met with intense protest about ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was smeared with elephant dung, although Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small [[collage]] images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]]. Among other criticism, New York Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm&gt;

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov. The fifth SEEDI International Conference Digitization of cultural and scientific heritage, May 19–20, 2010, Sarajevo. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|eprint = 0909.3892 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Online Science'|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J. A |last6=Bailer-Jones |first6=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0811.0167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

A|last21=Bailer-Jones|first21=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0810.5155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|eprint=1301.3069|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|eprint = 0909.3895 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
BBC R&amp;D is part of the wider [[BBC Design &amp; Engineering]], and is led by Andy Conroy, Controller Research &amp; Development.&lt;ref name="andyconroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015/09/introduction-to-the-controller|title=Introduction to the Controller|work=BBC R&amp;D Blog|date=9 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the North Lab moved into [[MediaCityUK]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]]  along with several other departments of the BBC, whilst the South Lab remained in [[BBC White City|White City]] in London.

==History==
[[Image:Rainbow over Kingswood Warren - geograph.org.uk - 137535.jpg|thumb|Former site at [[Kingswood Warren]]]]
The department as it stands today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as '''Research and Innovation'''  but has since reverted to its original name. '''BBC Research &amp; Development''' has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the [[peak programme meter]] (PPM) which became the basis for many world standards.

===Innovations===
It has also been involved in many well known consumer technologies such as [[teletext]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[NICAM]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It was at the forefront of development of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]], stereo FM, and [[Radio Data System|RDS]]. These innovations have led to [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Innovation]] in 1969, 1974, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2011.

In the 1970s, its engineers designed the famous [[LS3/5A]] studio monitor for use in [[outside broadcasting]] units.&lt;ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice&gt;Prakel, David (August 1979).

[http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/stirling-broadcast-ls35a-v2-loudspeaker/ "Stirling Broadcast LS3/5a V2 Loudspeaker"]. ''The Absolute Sound''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure of Kingswood Warren and move to London and Salford===
In early 2010 the department had approximately 135 staff based at three locations:  White City in London, Kingswood Warren in [[Kingswood, Surrey]], and the R&amp;D (North Lab) at the BBC's Manchester offices at New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, [[Manchester]]. In early 2010 the Kingswood Warren site was vacated and the bulk of the department relocated to Centre House, in [[White City, London]] co-locating with the main campus of the BBC in London, whilst a significant number have moved to the new North Lab in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

==Future projects==
BBC R&amp;D engineers and researchers are currently active on approximately 50 projects, including 7 active national and international collaborative research efforts.

These include R&amp;D projects built around [[BBC Redux]]&lt;ref name="notube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|title=NoTube Archive Browser Experiment 1|work=NoTube Archive Browser|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306190402/http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|archive-date=6 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="james-archak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://custard-cat.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/archak-bbc-research-and-development.html|title=ArcHak|work=CustardCat|first=Bruce|last=James|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browser-extensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/08/-prototyping-weeknotes-29-2708.shtml|title=Prototyping Weeknotes #29|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=4296|title=BBC R&amp;D develops 'mood based navigation'|work=News|publisher=[[Digital TV Group]]|author=DTG staff|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/01/an-interface-for-mood-based-navigation.shtml|title=An Affective Interface for Mood-Based Navigation|first=Rosie|last=Campbell|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redux-mood-testing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/2009/10/mulitmedia_classification.shtml|work=Projects|title=Multimedia Classification|author=BBC Research and Development|accessdate=13 May 2012|quote=User Evaluation on BBC Redux (by BBC staff) …}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annual-2009-2010"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2009-2010.pdf|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 2009–2010|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Report 2010–2011|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2010-2011.pdf|page=5|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[proof of concept]] for the cross-platform, [[Flash video]]-based streaming version of the [[BBC iPlayer]].&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof13/Bird-Redux.pdf|first=Tom|last=Bird|date=28 May 2009|title=BBC Redux|publisher=[[UKNOF]] 13|location=Sheffield|pages=2–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''Bendor Gerard Robert Grosvenor''' (born 27 November 1977) is a British [[art dealer]], [[Art history|art historian]] and writer. He is known for discovering a number of important [[lost artworks]] by Old Master artists, including [[Sir Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brueghels-return-to-fold-as-lost-sheep-are-found-k6qm3cdzm|title=Brueghels Return to the Fold|work=The Times|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a dealer he specialises in Old Masters, with a particular interest in [[Anthony van Dyck]].

During 2011 - 2016 he performed specialist research for, and appeared in, the [[BBC1]] art programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxxz6/profiles/bendor-grosvenor|title=Fake or Fortune?|work=BBC One|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then presented the [[BBC4]] series ''[[Britain's Lost Masterpieces]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07xjtbp|title=Britain's Lost Masterpieces|work=BBC One|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Jacky Klein and Emma Dabiri, which ran from 2016 - 2017.

==Life and work==
Grosvenor was educated at [[Harrow School]], [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] where he completed his PhD entitled ''"The Politics of Foreign Policy: Lord Derby and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-8"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|title=Bendor Grosvenor|work=Philip Mould &amp; Company|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040923/http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|archivedate=24 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming an art historian he worked in politics, first as an adviser to the Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Lord Stratford]], and then to the Conservative MP [[Hugo Swire]].

His first major art discovery was a mis-catalogued portrait by [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] in 2003 that was being sold at a London auction as a work by Lawrence's pupil, [[George Henry Harlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/417wnxhPlvxr5JxPGdKFJcT/bendor-grosvenor|title=Bendor Grosvenor}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 until 2014 he worked for [[Philip Mould]] Ltd{{fact|date=February 2017}}, where he made a number of significant art historical discoveries, including lost works by artists such as [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], and [[Sir Anthony Van Dyck]], on whom he is an acknowledged specialist.{{cn|date=September 2018}} He now has his own company, and specialises in establishing the authenticity of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconografie.co.uk|title=Iconografie}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nicg|date=February 2017}} He recently{{when|date=September 2018}} sold a newly identified portrait by [[Joan Carlile]], the first professional British female artist, to the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/typical-how-britains-first-professional-female-artist-was-mistak|title=Typical!|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 he discovered the [[Lost portrait of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|"lost portrait" of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham ]] at [[Pollok House]], [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The painting was thought to be a copy of a painting by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]] that had been lost for nearly 400 years, but after restoration was found to be the original by Rubens.&lt;ref name="graun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slawson|first1=Nicola|title=Lost Rubens portrait of James I's 'lover' is rediscovered in Glasgow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lost-rubens-portrait-james-i-lover-rediscovered-glasgow|accessdate=26 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grosvenor has been a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, and the Lord Chancellor's Forum for Historical Manuscripts and Academic Research.{{citation_needed|date=April 2018}} He also works as a journalist and writer, and presents programmes for BBC2's ''[[The Culture Show]]''.

==Jacobite portraiture==
Grosvenor has made a special study of Jacobite portraiture. In 2009 he proved that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery's iconic portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] was in fact a portrait of Charles' brother, [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/gallery-admits-portrait-isn-t-bonnie-prince-charlie-1-782863|title=Gallery admits portrait isn't Bonnie Prince Charlie|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013 he discovered the [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]] by Scottish artist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] at [[Gosford House]], the home of the [[Earl of Wemyss]] near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost Bonnie Prince Charlie portrait found in Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-26287887|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrait is now on display at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]], and has taken the place of the La Tour pastel as the definitive portrait of Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14391862.Historic__lost__portrait_of_Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_secured_by_National_Galleries_of_Scotland|title=Historic lost portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie secured by the National Portrait Gallery|work=The Herald|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
The name ''Bendor'' is derived from the Grosvenor family's medieval heraldic shield, ''a bend or'', a golden [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] (diagonal stripe), which they used until 1389 when it was claimed instead by the Scrope family, in the case [[Scrope v Grosvenor]]. [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|The 2nd Duke of Westminster]] was nicknamed "Bendor". 

Bendor is the grandson of [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Baron Ebury|The 5th Baron Ebury]], and the 4th cousin once removed of [[Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster|The 7th Duke of Westminster]]. (He is fourth in line to the Marquessate of Westminster after [[Francis Grosvenor, 8th Earl of Wilton|The 8th Earl of Wilton]], Viscount Grey de Wilton, and his first cousin Alexander Grosvenor.) He is also of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] heritage.

[[Image:Library-shelves-bibliographies-Graz.jpg|thumb|250px|Bibliographies at the [[University Library of Graz]]]] 
'''Bibliography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βιβλίον ''biblion'', "book" and -γραφία ''-graphia'', "writing"), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of [[book]]s as physical,  cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |title=bibliology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as objects (descriptive bibliography).

== Etymology ==
The word ''bibliographia'' (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for "the intellectual activity of composing books". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Rudolf. ''Bibliographia, an inquiry into its definition and designations''. Translated by Mathilde V. Rovelstad. Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association; Folkestone, Kent, England: Dawson, 1980. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8389-0146-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Bibliography. http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliography in its systematic pursuit of understanding the past and the present through written and printed documents describes a way and means of extracting information from this material. Bibliographers are interested in comparing versions of texts to each other rather than in interpreting their meaning or assessing their significance.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Hardy, M. (2017). Bibliographic enterprise and the digital age: Charles Evans and the making of early American literature. ''American Literary History, 29''(2), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of study ==
Bibliography is a specialized aspect of [[library science]] (or [[library and information science]], LIS) and [[documentation science]]. It was established by a [[Belgian]], named [[Paul Otlet]] (1868-1944), who was the founder of the field of documentation, as a branch of the information sciences,  who wrote about "the science of bibliography."&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). ''Les sciences bibliographiques et la documentation''. Bruxelles, Institut international de bibliographie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). "The science of bibliography and documentation"2. In Rayward, W.B. (trans. and ed.), (1990), ''International organisation and dissemination of knowledge: Selected essays of Paul Otlet''. FID, Amsterdam: Elsevier.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have recently been voices claiming that "the bibliographical paradigm" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). "Arguments for 'the bibliographical paradigm'. Some thoughts inspired by the new English edition of the UDC", Information Research, 12(4) paper colis06. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as [[bibliometrics]], which is today an influential subfield in LIS.

These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include [[W. W. Greg]], [[Fredson Bowers]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[G. Thomas Tanselle]].

Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and  provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.

Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description.  Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bowers established in his foundational opus, ''The Principles of Bibliographic Description''. The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg's groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer's initial conception and intention in printing.

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers.

D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as "the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include "non-book texts" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gaskell, ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of [[publication]]s in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Terry.

=== Enumerative bibliography ===
[[File:Pn-samara-n-a-2000-11.jpg|thumb|Bibliographer workplace in Russia]]
An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as [[academic journal|journal]] [[article (publishing)|article]]s. Bibliographies range from "works [[citation|cited]]" lists at the end of books and articles, to complete and independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ''A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers'' (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized [[bibliographic database]]s. A [[library catalog]], while not referred to as a "bibliography," is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be [[tertiary source]]s.

Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.

Citation styles vary.

An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements:
* creator(s)
* title
* place of publication
* publisher or printer
* date of publication

An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains:
* creator(s)
* article title
* journal title
* volume
* pages
* date of publication

A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. [[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. [[Reference management software]] may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required.

Bibliographies differ from [[library catalog]]s by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some [[national library|national libraries]] effectively serve as {{illm|National bibliography|de|Nationalbibliografie|lt=national bibliographies}}, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifla.org/node/2216 |work= Ifla.org |title= National Bibliographic Register |accessdate= 1 December 2017 |publisher=[[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] |location=The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/natbib/bibprint.html |work= Help for researchers |title=National bibliographies and books in print |publisher=British Library |accessdate= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive bibliography ===
Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ''Principles of Bibliographical Description''
(1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "[providing] sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents" (124).

==== Descriptive bibliographies as scholarly product ====
Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object:
*Format and Collation/Pagination Statement&amp;nbsp;– a conventional, symbolic formula that describes the book block in terms of sheets, folds, quires, signatures, and pages
:::According to Bowers (193), the format of a book is usually abbreviated in the collation formula:
::::Broadsheet: I° or b.s. or bs.
::::Folio: 2° or fol.
::::Quarto: 4° or 4to or Q° or Q
::::Octavo: 8° or 8vo
::::Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo
::::Sexto-decimo: 16° or 16mo
::::Tricesimo-secundo: 32° or 32mo
::::Sexagesimo-quarto: 64° or 64mo
:::The collation, which follows the format, is the statement of the order and size of the gatherings.
::::For example, a quarto that consists of the signed gatherings:
:::::2 leaves signed A, 4 leaves signed B, 4 leaves signed C, and 2 leaves signed D
::::would be represented in the collation formula:
:::::4°: A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B-C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Binding&amp;nbsp;– a description of the binding techniques (generally for books printed after 1800)
*Title Page Transcription&amp;nbsp;– a transcription of the title page, including rule lines and ornaments
*Contents&amp;nbsp;– a listing of the contents (by section) in the book
*Paper&amp;nbsp;– a description of the physical properties of the paper, including production process, an account of chain-line measurements, and a description of watermarks (if present)
*Illustrations&amp;nbsp;– a description of the illustrations found in the book, including printing process (e.g. woodblock, intaglio, etc.), measurements, and locations in the text
*Presswork&amp;nbsp;– miscellaneous details gleaned from the text about its production
*Copies Examined&amp;nbsp;– an enumeration of the copies examined, including those copies' location (i.e. belonging to which library or collector)

=== Analytical bibliography ===
This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact&amp;nbsp;– such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book&amp;nbsp;– to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence&amp;nbsp;– such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc.&amp;nbsp;– to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.&lt;ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations&amp;nbsp;– and the aetiology of variations&amp;nbsp;– in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text (Bowers 498[1]).

== Bibliographers ==
[[File:Paul Otlet à son bureau.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Otlet]], to work in an office built at his home following the closure of the [[Mundaneum|Palais Mondial]] in June 1937]]
A ''bibliographer'' is a person who describes and lists books and other publications, with particular attention to such characteristics as authorship, publication date, edition, typography, etc. A person who limits such efforts to a specific field or discipline is a subject bibliographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first= Joan M. |year=2010|url= http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx |title=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=abc-clio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographer, in the technical meaning of the word, is anyone who writes about books. But the accepted meaning since at least the 18th century is a person who attempts a comprehensive account—sometimes just a list, sometimes a fuller reckoning—of the books written on a particular subject. In the present, bibliography is no longer a career, generally speaking; bibliographies tend to be written on highly specific subjects and by specialists in the field.

The term ''bibliographer'' is sometimes—in particular subject bibliographer—today used about certain roles performed in libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/bib_bibliographers |title=MLA Field Bibliographers |publisher=mla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bibliographic database]]s.

== Non-book material ==
Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ''bibliography'':
* [[Discography]]&amp;nbsp;– recorded music
* [[Filmography]]&amp;nbsp;–  films
* [[Webography]] (or webliography)&amp;nbsp;– websites (the first use of the word "webliography" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from June 1995)

Arachniography is a term coined by [[NASA]] research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of [[URL]]s about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ''[[arachne]]'' in reference to a spider and its web.&lt;ref name=atlantic2007&gt;{{cite book | author=Staff | page=28 | title=Encyclopedia Of Information Technology | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | year=2007 | isbn=81-269-0752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=D.

The '''Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation''' ('''CSIRO''') is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] agency responsible for scientific research. Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the community. 

CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world. From its headquarters in Canberra, CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States, employing about 5500 people.

Federally funded scientific research began in Australia {{age|1916|6|1}} years ago. The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance.  In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding. CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. In 1949 further legislated changes included re-naming the organisation as CSIRO.

Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], essential components of [[Wi-Fi]] technology, development of the first commercially successful [[polymer banknote]], the invention of the insect repellent in [[Aerogard]] and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia, such as the introduction of [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]] for the control of [[European rabbit|rabbit]] populations.

== Structure ==
CSIRO is governed by a board appointed by the Australian Government, currently chaired by [[David Thodey]]{{post-nominals|country=AUS|A0}}. There are nine directors inclusive of the Chief Executive, presently Dr. [[Larry R. Marshall|Larry Marshall]], who is responsible for management of the organisation.

== Research and focus areas ==
CSIRO is structured into research focus areas, services and infrastructure.

== History ==
===Evolution of the organisation===
A precursor to CSIRO, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, was established in 1916 on the initiative of prime minister [[Billy Hughes]]. However, the Advisory Council struggled with insufficient funding during the First World War. In 1920 the Council was renamed the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and was led by [[George Handley Knibbs]] (1921–26), but continued to struggle financially.

In 1926 the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] modified the principal Act for national scientific research (the ''Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 22 |date= 14 September 1920 |url= http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/iosaia1920221920384.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by passing ''The Science and Industry Research Act 1926''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 20 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= http://www5.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/saira1926201926306.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Act replaced the Institute with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). With encouragement from prime minister [[Stanley Bruce]], strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding, CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. The council was structured to represent the federal structure of government in Australia, and had state-level committees and a central council. In addition to an improved structure, CSIR benefited from strong bureaucratic management under [[George Julius]], [[David Rivett]], and Arnold Richardson. Research focused on primary and secondary industries. Early in its existence, CSIR established divisions studying animal health and animal nutrition. After the [[Great Depression]], research was extended into manufacturing and other secondary industries.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/our-history/ |title= Our history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 the Act was changed again&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1949 |number= 13 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00352/Download |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entity name amended to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The amendment enlarged and reconstituted the organisation and its administrative structure. Under [[Ian Clunies Ross]] as chairman, CSIRO pursued new areas such as radio astronomy and industrial chemistry. CSIRO still operates under the provisions of the 1949 Act in a wide range of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

Since 1949 CSIRO has expanded its activities to almost every field of primary, secondary and tertiary industry, including the environment, human nutrition, conservation, urban and rural planning, and water.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; It works with leading organisations around the world and maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States of America, employing about 5500 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csiro.au/en/About/International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/International |title=International collaboration – CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-01-28 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic research===
CSIRO had a pioneering role in the scientific discovery of the universe through radio "eyes". A team led by [[Paul Wild (Australian scientist)|Paul Wild]] built and operated (from 1948) the world’s first solar radiospectrograph, and from 1967 the {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} radioheliograph at Culgoora in New South Wales. For three decades, the Division of Radiophysics had a world-leading role in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |title=Dr John Paul Wild |publisher=CSIRO |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125053338/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO owned the first computer in Australia, [[CSIRAC]], built as part of a project began in the Sydney Radiophysics Laboratory in 1947. The CSIR Mk 1 ran its first program in 1949, the fifth electronic computer in the world. It was over 1,000 times faster than the mechanical calculators available at the time. It was decommissioned in 1955 and recommissioned in Melbourne as CSIRAC in 1956 as a general purpose computing machine used by over 700 projects until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |title=CSIRAC |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |work=Department of Computer Science and Engineering |accessdate=2006-05-08 |author1=Steven Pass |author2=David Hornsby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227165717/http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRAC is the only surviving first-generation computer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/csirac/ |title=Museum Victoria's CSIRAC information site|accessdate=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965 and 1985, [[George Bornemissza]] of CSIRO's Division of Entomology founded and led the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]]. Bornemissza, upon settling in Australia from Hungary in 1951, noticed that the pastureland was covered in dry cattle dung pads which did not seem to be recycled into the soil and caused areas of rank pasture which were unpalatable to the cattle. He proposed that the reason for this was that native Australian dung beetles, which had co-evolved alongside the marsupials (which produce dung very different in its composition from cattle), were not adapted to utilise cattle dung for their nutrition and breeding since cattle had only relatively recently been introduced to the continent in the 1880s. The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures. Twenty-three species were successfully introduced throughout the duration of the project and also had the effect of reducing the pestilent bush fly population by 90%.&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bornemissza G.

===Domain name===
CSIRO was the first Australian organisation to start using the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |title=AARNET – About Us – History |publisher=[[Australian Academic and Research Network]] |accessdate=16 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412054848/https://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to register the [[second-level domain]] csiro.au (as opposed to csiro.org.au or csiro.com.au).  Guidelines were introduced in 1996 to regulate the use of the [[.au]] domain.

When CSIR was formed in 1926, it was led initially by an Executive Committee of three people, two of whom were designated as the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Since then the roles and responsibilities of the Chair and Chief Executive have changed many times. From 1927 to 1986 the head of CSIR (and from 1949, CSIRO)&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; was the Chairman, who was responsible for the management of the organisation, supported by the Chief Executive. From 1 July 1959 to 4 December 1986 CSIRO had no Chief Executive; the Chairman undertook both functions.&lt;ref name="heads"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/heads-of-csiro-2/ |title= Chief Executives and Chairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when the [[Hawke Government|Australian Government]] changed the structure of CSIRO to include a board of non-executive members plus the Chief Executive to lead CSIRO, the roles changed. The Chief Executive is now responsible for management of the organisation in accordance with the strategy, plans and policies approved by the CSIRO Board which, led by the Chair of the Board, is responsible to the Australian Government for the overall strategy, governance and performance of CSIRO.&lt;ref name="heads"/&gt;

As with its governance structure, the priorities and structure of CSIRO, and the teams and facilities that implement its research, have changed as Australia's scientific challenges have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/organisational-history/ |title= Organisational history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Total Wellbeing Diet===
In 2005 the CSIRO gained worldwide attention, including some criticism, for promoting a high-[[protein]], low-[[carbohydrate]] diet of their own creation called ''[[Total Wellbeing Diet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Health-and-Wellbeing/Prevention/Total-Wellbeing-Diet-online.aspx |title=CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet online - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRO published the diet in a book which sold over half a million copies in Australia and over 100,000 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-24 |title=The town taking the CSIRO challenge |work=[[A Current Affair (Australian TV program)|A Current Affair]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213020826/http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet was criticised in an editorial by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' for giving scientific credence to a "fashionable" diet sponsored by meat and dairy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/peers-turn-up-heat-on-csiro-diet/2005/12/27/1135445573297.html |title=Peers turn up heat on CSIRO diet |publisher=The Age |date=28 December 2005 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classicbackissues.australasianscience.com.au/bi2006/272CSIROdiet.pdf |title=Nature Gags on CSIRO Diet |publisher=Australasian Science |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===802.11 patent===
In the early 1990s, CSIRO radio astronomy scientists John O'Sullivan, Graham Daniels, Terence Percival, Diethelm Ostry and John Deane undertook research directed to finding a way to make wireless networks work as fast as wired networks within confined spaces such as office buildings. The technique they developed, involving a particular combination of [[forward error correction]], frequency-domain interleaving, and [[multi-carrier modulation]], became the subject of {{US Patent|5487069}}, which was granted on 23 January 1996.

In 1997 Macquarie University professor David Skellern and his colleague Neil Weste established the company Radiata, Inc., which took a nonexclusive licence to the CSIRO patent for the purpose of developing commercially viable integrated circuit devices implementing the patented technology.&lt;ref name=Radiata&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Mark |title=Creating and Exploiting Intangible Networks: How Radiata was able to improve its odds of success in the risky process of innovating |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/3C2255E6-B6E5-49EB-BB96-1FBA94EB0EA4/1372/radiata.pdf |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Education, Science and Training |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author2=Bob Frater |pages=8–9 &amp; 16 |format=PDF |date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the [[IEEE 802.11]] Working Group was developing the 802.11a wireless LAN standard. CSIRO did not participate directly in the standards process, however David Skellern was an active participant as secretary of the Working Group, and representative of Radiata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skellern |first=David |title=Tentative Minutes of the IEEE P802.11 Full Working Group |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Minutes/Cons_Minutes_99July.pdf |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=5–9 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 it became apparent that the CSIRO patent would be pertinent to the standard. In response to a request from Victor Hayes of Lucent Technologies, who was Chair of the 802.11 Working Group, CSIRO confirmed its commitment to make non-exclusive licenses available to implementers of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Dennis |title=Letter to Mr V Hayes, Chair, IEEE P802.11 |url=http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/loa-802_11a-csiro-04Dec1998.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=4 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Cisco Systems]], Inc. and [[Broadcom]] Corporation each invested A$4&amp;nbsp;million in Radiata, representing an 11% stake for each investor and valuing the company at around A$36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt; In September 2000, Radiata demonstrated a chip set complying with the recently finalised IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi standard, and capable of handling transmission rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, at a major international exhibition.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt;

In November 2000, Cisco acquired Radiata in exchange for US$295&amp;nbsp;million in Cisco common stock with the intention of incorporating the Radiata Baseband Processor and Radio chips into its Aironet family of wireless LAN products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release: Cisco Systems to Acquire Radiata, Inc. |url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc. |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124055012/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |archivedate=24 November 2001 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cisco subsequently took a large write-down on the Radiata acquisition, following the 2001 [[telecoms crash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heskett |first=Ben |title=Cisco still confident after networking shock |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/cisco-still-confident-after-networking-shock/119211 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 it shut down its internal development of wireless chipsets based on the Radiata technology in order to focus on software development and emerging new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |title=Cisco retires wireless chipsets |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033_3-5151131.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CNET News |date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the CSIRO patent arose in 2006 after the organisation won an injunction against [[Buffalo Technology]] in an infringement suit filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO wins landmark legal battle |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/wireless--broadband/csiro-wins-landmark-legal-battle/2006/11/15/1163266614119.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Age |date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction was subsequently suspended on appeal, with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding that the judge in Texas should have allowed a trial to proceed on Buffalo’s challenge to the validity of the CSIRO patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Venkatesan |first=Arun |title=Buffalo Allowed to sell wireless products again (for now) |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/03/buffalo-allowed-to-sell-wireless-products-again-for-now/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechCrunch |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CSIRO declined to provide an assurance to the IEEE that it would not sue companies which refused to take a license for use in 802.11n-compliant devices, while at the same time continuing to defend legal challenges to the validity of the patent brought by [[Intel]], [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Netgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winterford |first=Brett |title=No backdown from CSIRO over Wi-Fi patents |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2007/10/02/no-backdown-from-csiro-over-wi-fi-patents-39289756/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy grew after CSIRO sued US carriers [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon]] and [[T-Mobile]] in 2010, with the organisation being accused of being "Australia's biggest patent troll", a wrathful "patent bully", and of imposing a "WiFi tax" on American innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Popper |first=Ben |title=Australia's Biggest Patent Troll Goes After AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-43340647/australias-biggest-patent-troll-goes-after-at038t-verizon-and-t-mobile/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CBS News |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent fight targets more victims: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/21/csiros-patent-fight-targets-more-victims-atandt-verizon-wireles/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=CSIRO Wants To Expand Its WiFi Tax: Sues Mobile Operators |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1913309652.shtml |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechDirt |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetically modified wheat trials===
On 14 July 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists vandalised a crop of GM wheat, circumventing the scientific trials being undertaken. Greenpeace was forced to pay reparations to CSIRO of $280,000 for the criminal damage, and were accused by the sentencing judge, Justice Hilary Penfold, of cynically using junior members of the organisation with good standing to avoid custodial sentences, while the offenders were given 9-month suspended sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/greenpeace-activists-in-costly-gm-protest-20120802-23i0t.html| title=Greenpeace activists in costly GM protest| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| date=2012-08-02| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/gm-crop-destroyers-given-suspended-sentences-20121119-29l66.html| title=GM crop destroyers given suspended sentences| publisher=Canberra Times| date=2012-11-19| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack Greenpeace criticised CSIRO for a close relationship with industry that had led to an increase in [[genetically modified crops]], even though a core aim of CSIRO is Cooperative Research "working hand in hand with industry [to] build partnerships and engage with industry to generate impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Partner/Industry.aspx | title = Working hand in hand with industry | accessdate = 8 Nov 2013 | date = 22 April 2013 | work = CSIRO website | publisher = Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/en/mediacentre/media-releases/food/Greenpeace-calls-on-CSIRO-to-come-clean-on-commercial-relationships/ |title= Greenpeace calls on CSIRO to come clean on commercial relationships |date= 15 July 2011 |publisher= www.greenpeace.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change censorship: Clive Spash ===
On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-2-The-Australian-FRONT-PAGE.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 2 November 2009 |title= CSIRO bid to gag emissions trading scheme policy attack |work= The Australian |publisher= News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, [[Megan Clark]], which attacked the report's author and threatened him with unspecified punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9_News_26_Nov_2009.pdf |author= Crystal, J. |date= 26 November 2009 |title= CSIRO scientist faces punishment |publisher= 9 News |location= Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Climate expert Clive Spash 'heavied' by CSIRO management |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-3-The_Australian-Climate_expert_Clive_Spash_heavied_by_CSIRO_management.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 3 November 2009 |work= The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later gave a radio interview about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MW-CSIRO-121212.mp3 |author= Walsh, M. |year= 2012 |title= The toxic workplace and bullying culture at CSIRO |publisher= www.2cc.net.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be "tiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091113/full/news.2009.1083.html |author= Pincock, S. |date=13 November 2009 |title= Australian agency moves to calm climate row. Researcher will be allowed to publish his paper after making 'tiny' changes. |journal= Nature |doi=10.1038/news.2009.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spash claimed the changes actually demanded amounted to censorship and resigned. He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An Orwellian guide to carbon emissions trading |author= Spash, C. |year= 2010 |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OrwellianGuidetoCarbonETS.pdf |publisher= www.clivespash.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Senate 2010. Senate Economics Legislation Committee Estimates. Canberra: Official Hansard (Wednesday, 10 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, [[New Political Economy (journal)|New Political Economy]], which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an 'A class' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/era2010_journal_title_list.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119133137/http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/ERA2010_journal_title_list.xls |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dumped Professor calls for Senate inquiry |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2829301.htm |author= Colvin, M. |year= 2010 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these events, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''  reported that "Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.smh.com.au/business/csiro-in-bed-with-big-coal-20100702-zu2i.html |author= Manning, P. |year= 2010 |title= CSIRO in bed with big coal |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/ |author= Spash, C.

===CSIRO–Novartis–DataTrace scandal===
On 11 April 2013, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' ran a story on how CSIRO had "duped" the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant [[Novartis]] into purchasing an anti-counterfeit technology for its vials of injectable [[Voltaren]]. The invention was marketed by a small Australian company called DataTrace DNA as a method of identifying fake vials, on the basis that a unique tracer code developed by CSIRO was embedded in the product. However, the code sold to Novartis for more than A$2M was apparently not unique, and was based on a "cheap tracer ... bought in bulk from a Chinese distributor". Novartis was contractually bound not to reverse-engineer the tracer to verify its uniqueness. The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report alleges that this was done with the knowledge of key CSIRO personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the CSIRO cheated a global drugs giant |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-csiro-cheated-a-global-drugs-giant-20130410-2hluf.html |accessdate=12 April 2012 |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO has since conducted a full review of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Media/CSIRO-review-of-issues-raised-about-CSIROs-interactions-with-DataTrace.aspx |title=CSIRO review of issues raised about CSIRO’s interactions with DataTrace |publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged bullying, harassment and victimisation===
In recent years{{When|date=February 2017}} the CSIRO has fallen under the spotlight for allegedly exhibiting a culture of workplace bullying and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser and Nicky Phillips (12 April 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/science-second-in-toxic-csiro-work-culture-20130412-2hqv0.html "Science second in toxic CSIRO work culture"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former CSIRO employees started to surface with experiences of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (5 February 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/probe-into-csiro-bullying-20130205-2dwva.html "Probe into CSIRO bullying"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (18 September 2012) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/whistleblowers-at-csiro-forced-out-and-bullying-rife-20120917-262hk.html "Whistleblowers at CSIRO forced out and bullying rife"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; CSIRO took the allegations seriously and responded to the articles on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (14 April 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/More-than-85-years-growth-change-impact.aspx "More than 85 years of growth, change and impact"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (2 May 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Chief-Executive-Megan-Clarks-update-to-staff-re-Fairfax-articles.aspx "Chief Executive Megan Clark's update to staff re Fairfax articles"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, [[Sophie Mirabella]], wrote to the government requesting it establish an inquiry. Mirabella said she is aware of as many as 100 cases of alleged workplace harassment. On 20 July 2012 [[Comcare]] issued CSIRO with an Improvement Notice with regard to handling and management of workplace misconduct/code of conduct type investigations and allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130727093429/http://www.comcare.gov.au/about_us/access_to_information/disclosure_log/foi_requested_documents/improvement_notice_relating_to_eve207221 ]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2013 Mirabella advised the [[Australian House of Representatives]] that in relation to the worker's compensation claim for psychological injuries of ex-CSIRO employee, Martin Williams, which was vigorously defended by [[Comcare]] on the advice of the CSIRO, that CSIRO officers had provided false testimony on no less than 128 occasions under oath when the matter went before the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;''"I am also reminded of the government's stubborn unwillingness to bring the CSIRO to account for a series of inaccurate and misleading statements that have been made to the Senate estimates committees, including the recent incomprehensible answer to question AL156 which says that no CSIRO employee provided false evidence under oath during cross-examination in the AAT case involving Martin Williams, when an analysis of the transcript of that case suggests that there are at least 100, and more precisely around 128, separate instances of CSIRO officers providing false evidence in the case."''

===CSIRO and the Liberal Government===
In August 2015 the CSIRO discontinued its annual July and August survey, conducted over the previous five years, polling to create a long-term view of how Australians viewed global warming and their support for action.  In the previous 2013 poll, 86 per cent agreed with the statement that climate change was occurring and only 7.6 per cent disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-change-csiro-axes-annual-attitudes-survey-delays-2014-results-20150810-giw6i1.html |title=Climate change: CSIRO axes annual attitudes survey, delays 2014 results |website=Smh.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 11th February 2016, Dr Larry Marshall – a former venture capitalist with Southern Cross Venture Holdings, who had been appointed CEO of the CSIRO on the 1st January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Leadership-governance/Chief-Executive-and-Executive-Team/Team |title=Executive Team - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2015-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused an international outcry after describing Australia’s national climate change discussion as “more like religion than science,” a week after announcing hundreds of job cuts to the organisation that will reduce the effectiveness of its climate research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/climate-politics-more-like-religion-says-csiro-boss-90059 |title=Climate politics 'more like religion', says CSIRO boss |publisher=Renew Economy |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “an open letter to the Australian Government and CSIRO”, 2,800 of the leading climate scientists from 60 countries say the announcement of cuts to the CSIRO’s Oceans and Atmosphere research program has alarmed the global climate research community.  They say the decision shows a lack of insight and a misunderstanding of the importance of the depth and significance of Australian contributions to global and regional climate research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-top-scientists-beg-malcolm-turnbull-to-allow-csiro-to-continue-its-climate-research-2016-2 |title=The world's top scientists beg Malcolm Turnbull to allow CSIRO to continue its climate research |website=Businessinsider.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California NanoSystems Institute''' ('''CNSI''') is an integrated research center operating jointly at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]]. Its missions are to foster interdisciplinary collaborations for discoveries in nanosystems and [[nanotechnology]]; train the next generation of scientists, educators and technology leaders; and facilitate partnerships with industry, fueling economic development and the social well-being of [[California]], the United States and the [[world]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

CNSI was created by Governor [[Gray Davis]] as part of a science and innovation initiative, it was established in 2000 with $100 million from the state of California and an additional $250 million in federal research grants and industry funding. At the institute, scientists in the areas of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, mathematics, computational science and engineering measure, modify and manipulate the building blocks of our world – [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s. These scientists benefit from an integrated laboratory culture enabling them to conduct dynamic research at the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]], leading to significant breakthroughs in the areas of health, energy, the environment and information technology.

== History ==
On December 7, 2000, California Governor Gray Davis announced the location of the federally sponsored California NanoSystems Institute section of the [[California Institutes for Science and Innovation]] (Cal ISI) initiative. The California legislature put forth $100 million for  three research facilities to advance the future of the state's economy.&lt;ref&gt;California Launches Major Nanotechnology Research Initiative”. Foresight Update 43.December 20, 2000. &lt;http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html&gt;. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019170748/http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html |date=2008-10-19 }} 13 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) was selected out of the proposals along with three other Cal ISIs: [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]] (QB3), [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] (Cal-(IT)2), and [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] (CITRIS).&lt;ref&gt;Foust, Brenda. “The California Institutes for Science and Innovation”.

{{Anthropology of art|Related articles}}
'''Cantometrics''' ("song measurements") is a method developed by [[Alan Lomax]] and a team of researchers for relating elements of the world's [[tradition]]al vocal music (or [[folk music|folk songs]])  to features of [[sociology|social]] organization as defined via [[George Murdock]]'s  [[Human Relations Area Files]], resulting in a taxonomy of expressive human communications style. Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a "systems-maintaining framework" which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management). 

Instead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in [[linguistics]], [[otolaryngology]] and [[Speech and Language Pathology|voice therapy]]. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of [[vocables]] versus meaningful words); and [[melisma]] ([[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]), to name a few. 

In the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children.... I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style"&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.culturalequity.org/psr-history.jsp Cantometrics: Concept of Style]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the theory==

Lomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co-creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished [[Columbia University]] anthropologist [[Conrad M. Arensberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Author of the pathbreaking ethnographic classic, ''The Irish Countryman: An Anthropological Study'', (1937), Arensberg helped shift the focus of anthropology from the study of exotic primitive peoples to the examination of complex modern societies. See his [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/nyregion/conrad-arensberg-86-dies-hands-on-anthropologist.html  1997 ''New York Times'' obituary.]&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of [[applied anthropology]]; anthropologists Edwin Erickson and Barbara Ayres; and statistician Norman Berkowitz. [[Laban Movement Analysis|Laban shape notation]] specialist [[Irmgard Bartenieff]] &lt;ref&gt;Pioneer physical therapist and developer of [[Bartenieff Fundamentals]], [http://www.culturalequity.org/alanlomax/ce_alanlomax_profile_irmgard_bartenieff.php Irmgard Bartinieff] is profiled on Lomax website [http://www.culturalequity.org/ Culturalequity.org].&lt;/ref&gt; and dancer and movement therapist Forrestine Paulay co-created the Choreometrics movement coding system, for analyzing dance, mapping the movement of the torso, hands, feet, and use of performance space. In 1968 Lomax's research team published a book, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'', in which they stated that, "for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other". 

Gideon D'Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 songs – around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the Columbia mainframe. A companion study of dance, Choreometrics, produced analyses of over 1,500 dance performances. Only a computer was capable of handling this enormous data set and looking for the patterns hidden within. The team, led by programmer Norman Berkowitz, developed a powerful set of statistically driven software tools to sort, separate, and group the performance data. Their analyses resulted in the first ever taxonomy of human performance style and in a series of maps showing the dis-semination of culture across the planet. These were presented to the American Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative volume, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Popular_Songbook.html Gideon D'Arcangelo, "Alan Lomax and the Big Story of Sound" in liner notes to ''The Alan Lomax Popular Song Book'' Rounder CD 82161-1863-1 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Results==

The Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship.  

Other results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system.

Murdock's taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales – for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of  production or permanence of settlement.  When they added factors of expressive communication  to the Murdock  measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture.

==Branching out into Choreometrics==

Three chapters of ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, "Dance, Style, and Culture," Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: "In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.".&lt;ref&gt;Lomax (1968), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture...  The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax et al. (1968) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax's type of analysis, since movement is "not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study of aurally perceived behavior." &lt;ref&gt;Irmgard Bartenieff, "Research in Anthropology: A Study of Dance Styles in Primitive Cultures", Cord Dance Research Annual I (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Films==

A series of short documentary films demonstrated some of  the results of the team's statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms.&lt;ref&gt;A book that Lomax and Paulay wrote about their findings remains in manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; These were: ''Dance &amp; Human History'' (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; ''Palm Play'' (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; ''Step Style'' (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally;&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from Lomax's film ''Step Style'' appeared in the online edition of the [http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/01/30/arts/music/100000001322535/the-lomax-archives.html New York Times of January 31, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Longest Trail'' (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD ''Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay'' produced by John Melville Bishop (Media-Generation, 1974–2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Welsch, in his 2009 review of the DVD in [http://www.media-generation.com/Articles/RhythmsVA.pdf, ''Visual Anthropology'', 22:241-242, 2009.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, cautioned that the films, some of them over 35 years old, now appear dated and warned that the late [[Robert Gardner (anthropologist)|Robert Gardner]], in one of the DVD's special features, was shown chain smoking, nevertheless he judged that students in introductory courses would find the material "dazzling" and pronounced the DVD "must-see for more advanced courses in expressive culture, visual anthropology, and any course involving ethnographic film."&lt;/ref&gt; Improvisational jazz musician and composer [[Roswell Rudd]] later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance.

==Criticisms and responses==
The reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological [[homology (sociology)|homology]].

The musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well. 

Alan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of our samples will hold up. Even "secret" songs generally tend to be stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not primarily concerned with "complete" collections and descriptions, as are most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Grauer noted that: “Cantometrics is a statistical method.  Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one.  There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/cantome2.htm Victor Grauer, "Song and Social Culture, A Response",  ''Musical Traditions'' web magazine, July 27, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantometrics as an educational tool==
The Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Roswell Rudd, quoted in Gideon D’Arcangelo (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Some have likened The Global Jukebox to [[Pandora (radio)|Pandora]], see for example the / interview of Don Fleming by reporter [[John Hockenberry]] on the [[Public Radio International]] [http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere  program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere |date=February 2, 2012 }}, [[The Takeaway (radio)|The Takeaway.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/arts/music/the-alan-lomax-collection-from-the-american-folklife-center.html?pagewanted=all  Larry Rohter, "Folklorist’s Global Jukebox Goes Digital", ''New York Times'' (January 31, 2019)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Children's literature''' or '''juvenile literature''' includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.

Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider [[oral tradition]], that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the "Golden Age of Children's Literature", because many classic children's books were published then.

== Introduction ==
There is no single or widely used definition of children's literature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} It can be broadly defined as anything that children read&lt;ref name=nodel&gt;{{cite book|last=Nodelman|first=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|year= 2008|publisher= [[JHU]]|page=4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKosfJZhUwQC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-8018-8980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specifically defined as [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], or [[drama]] intended for and used by children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Children's Literature|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/chi.pdf|work=LIbrary of Congress Collections Policy Statement|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20thc&gt;{{cite book|last= Chevalier|first= Tracy|title=Twentieth-Century Children's Writers|year=1989|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|location= [[Chicago]]|isbn= 0-912289-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvii}} One writer on children's literature defines it as "all books written for children, excluding works such as [[comic book]]s, joke books, [[cartoon book]]s, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others would argue that comics should also be included: "Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, C. "Abstract":, "Comic Art, Children's Literature, and the New Comic Studies." ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', vol. 30 no. 3, 2006, pp. 360-382. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0031 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202582/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' notes that "the boundaries of [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;... are not fixed but blurred".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first= Peter (editor)|title= International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P74RiK3CRGkC&amp;pg=PP4|isbn= 978-0-203-16812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=The ''Times'' Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before [[printing]], and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers.&lt;ref name=Arbuth&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbuthnot|first=May Hill|title=Children and Books|year=1964|publisher=[[Scott, Foresman Publishers|Scott, Foresman]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} [[Seth Lerer]], in the opening of ''Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter'', says, "This book presents a history of what children have heard and read&amp;nbsp;... The history I write of is a history of ''reception''."&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|2}}

== History ==
&lt;!--Note to future editors: This should not be a list of books published but an encyclopedic summary of significant advances and changes around the world. Please keep this from becoming a mere list. See note on talk page for order of information for this section--&gt;
Early children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web|title=To Instruct and Delight A History of Children's Literature| url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/024children.html|publisher=Randon History|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and [[Western canon|canon]].&lt;ref name=nikola&gt;{{cite book|last= Nikolajeva|first= María (editor) |author-link=Maria Nikolajeva |title= Aspects and Issues in the History of Children's Literature|year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ubZL9V1L9fEC&amp;pg=PR9|isbn= 978-0-313-29614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x-xi}} The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. &lt;ref&gt;•Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, French historian [[Philippe Ariès]] argues in his book ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment.&lt;ref name=shav&gt;{{cite book|last= Shavit|first= Zohar|title= Poetics of Children's Literature|year= 2009|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8203-3481-3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NerYSgnlnaIC&amp;pg=PP10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by [[cleric]]s like [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] and [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMunn|first=Meradith Tilbury|author2=William Robert McMunn|title=Children's Literature in the Middle Ages|journal=[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]|year=1972|volume= 1|pages=21| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v001/1.mcmunn.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|doi=10.1353/chl.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Johanna|title=From Chapbooks to Plumb Cake: The History of Children's Literature|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|isbn=978-0-549-34070-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65KJo_XpLoYC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyile|first= Andrea Schwenke (editor)|title=Considering Children's Literature: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Broadview|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MWTY0BK5jbIC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'' from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name=kline&gt;{{cite book|last= Kline|first= Daniel T.|title= Medieval Literature for Children|year= 2003|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8153-3312-8| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcxBsWXg9mYC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a [[didactic]] and [[Morality|moralistic]] nature, with the purpose of conveying [[Conduct book|conduct]]-related, educational and [[Religious book|religious]] lessons.&lt;ref name=kline /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

=== Early-modern Europe ===
[[File:Hornbook Mexican.png|left|thumb|An early Mexican [[hornbook]] pictured in Tuer's ''History of the Horn-Book'', 1896.]]
During the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them.&lt;ref name=shav /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last= Reynolds|first= Kimberley|title= Children's Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The English philosopher [[John Locke]] developed his theory of the [[tabula rasa]] in his 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with "easy pleasant books" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; "children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for." He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 ''Tales of Mother Goose''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from [[Puritanism]], which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of "good godly books" aimed squarely at children.&lt;ref name=random /&gt; Some of the most popular works were by [[James Janeway]], but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) by [[John Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The New Amplified Pilgrim's Progress'' (both book and dramatized audio) – as retold by James Pappas. Published by Orion's Gate (1999) and ''The Evergreen Wood: An Adaptation of the "Pilgrim's Progress" for Children'' written by Linda Perry, illustrated by Alan Perry. Published by Hunt &amp; Thorpe, 1997. [[The Pilgrim's Progress#Retellings]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chapbook]]s, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched,&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|32}} were published in Britain; illustrated by [[Woodcut|woodblock printing]], these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular [[ballads]], historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|8}} Johanna Bradley says, in ''From Chapbooks to Plum Cake'', that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict [[Puritan]] influence of the time.&lt;ref name=brad /&gt;{{rp|17}}
[[File:Aforadam.png|thumb|The New England Primer]]
[[Hornbook]]s also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref name=questia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia: Children's Literature|year=2009|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190423/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|archive-date=2012-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were brought from England to the [[British America|American colonies]] in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a [[catechism]] for children written in verse by the Puritan [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]]. Known as ''[[Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes]]'', it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and [[Boston]]. Another early book, ''[[The New England Primer]]'', was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] begins, "In Adam's fall We sinned all&amp;nbsp;...", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|35}}

In 1634, the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. [[Charles Perrault]] began recording [[fairy tale]]s in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos [[Comenius]] in [[Bohemia]] published the informative illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'', for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The first [[Denmark|Danish]] children's book was ''The Child's Mirror'' by [[Niels Bredal]] in 1568, an adaptation of a [[Courtesy book]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] priest [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]. ''A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror'', an adaptation of a [[Germany|German]] book for young women, became the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book upon its 1591 publication.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|700, 706}} Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.

In [[Italy]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] released ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Opie |first=Iona |author2=[[Peter Opie]]  |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |page=20|location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Russia]]'s earliest children's books, [[Primer (textbook)|primers]], appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is ''ABC-Book'', an [[alphabet book]] published by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1571.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} The first [[picture book]] published in Russia, [[Karion Istomin]]'s ''The Illustrated Primer'', appeared in 1694.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Peter the Great]]'s interest in [[Modernization|modernizing]] his country through [[Westernization]] helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Catherine the Great]] wrote [[Allegory|allegories]] for children, and during her reign, [[Nikolai Novikov]] started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}}

=== Origins of the modern genre ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Brothers Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] (left) and [[Jakob Grimm]] (right) from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

The modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-the-newbery-award-got-its-name/|title=How the Newbery Award Got Its Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing [[politeness|polite]] middle-class and the influence of [[John Locke|Lockean]] theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', written and published by [[John Newbery]], is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kodomo.go.jp/ingram/e/section1/index.html|title=Early Children's Literature: From moralistic stories to narratives of everyday life}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last= Marks|first= Diana F.|title=Children's Book Award Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= [[Libraries Unlimited]]|location= Westport, Conn|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, John Rowe.

The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the [[toy book]]s popular in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lundin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lundin, Anne H. |year=1994 |title=Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880–1900 |journal=The Library Quarterly |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=64 |issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', "Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements&amp;nbsp;... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Susina|first= Jan|title= Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature |journal= The Lion and the Unicorn |date=June 1993|volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= v–vi| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v017/17.1.susina.html| accessdate=30 July 2012 |doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;



The improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]];&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Rose, 219"&gt;Rose, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may have written ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'', Newbery's most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|41}} Popular examples included [[Thomas Day]]'s ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'', four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Practical Education]]: The History of Harry and Lucy'' (1780) urged children to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Zachary, ''Reading Blake's Songs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Q9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on [[Philanthropinum|German Philanthropism]], a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]], authored ''Elementarwerk'' as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. Another follower, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], created an adaptation of ''Robinson Crusoe'' that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's "outstanding and most modern"&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|736}} writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|737}}

The [[Brothers Grimm]] preserved and published [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|the traditional tales]] told in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Silvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvey|first=Anita (editor)|title=The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators|year= 2002|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]|location= New York|isbn=0-618-19082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|739–740}} The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|259}} 

A similar project was carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholars [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as ''[[Norwegian Folktales]]'', often referred to as ''Asbjørnsen and Moe''. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|260}}

Danish author and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]] traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Elias Bredsdorff, ''Hans Christian Andersen: the story of his life and work 1805–75'', Phaidon (1975) {{ISBN|0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Switzerland]], [[Johann David Wyss]] published ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by [[Isabelle de Montolieu]].

[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s tale "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, ''Kinder-Märchen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutcracker|last=Hoffmann|first=E.

=== Golden age ===
The shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; [[didacticism]] of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and [[printing]] became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|654–655}}

''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the [[school story]] tradition.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last= Knowles|first= Murray|title= Language and Control in Children's Literature|year= 1996|publisher= [[Psychology Press]]| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2mh6pCDCZ5EC&amp;pg=PP7|isbn= 978-0-203-41975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}} However, it was [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first "English masterpiece written for children"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|44}} and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the "First Golden Age" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=knowles /&gt;{{rp|18}} Another important book of that decade was ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'', by Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', which was translated many times. In that same year, [[Emilio Salgari]], the man who would become "the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy"&lt;ref&gt;Lawson Lucas, A. (1995) "The Archetypal Adventures of Emilio Salgari: A Panorama of his Universe and Cultural Connections New Comparison", ''A Journal of Comparative and General Literary Studies'', Number 20 Autumn&lt;/ref&gt; first published his legendary character ''[[Sandokan]]''. In Britain, ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'', by [[George MacDonald]], appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', both by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], were extremely popular in the 1880s. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was first published in 1894, and [[J. M. Barrie]] told the story of [[Peter Pan]] in the novel  ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' in 1911. [[Johanna Spyri]]'s two-part novel ''[[Heidi]]'' was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|749}} In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. Boys' book writer [[William Taylor Adams|Oliver Optic]] published over 100 books. In 1868, the "epoch-making book"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|45}} ''[[Little Women]]'', the fictionalized autobiography of [[Louisa May Alcott]], was published. This "[[coming of age]]" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. [[Mark Twain]] released ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'' in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'', a collection of [[African American]] folk tales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|478}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' (1883), L.M. Montgomery's ''Anne of Green Gables'' (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1869) &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National traditions ==

=== China ===
The Chinese [[Revolution of 1911]] and [[World War II]] brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, [[Commercial Press]], established several children's magazines, which included ''Youth Magazine'', and ''Educational Pictures for Children''.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|832–833}} The first Chinese children's writer was [[Sun Yuxiu]], an editor of Commercial Press, whose story ''The Kingdom Without a Cat'' was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist [[Mao Dun|Shen Dehong]] to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, [[Zhang Tianyi]] published ''Big Lin and Little Lin'', the first full-length Chinese novel for children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|833–834}}

The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution of 1949]] changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and [[Ye Shengtao]] continued to write for children and created works that aligned with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. The 1976 death of [[Mao Zedong]] provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, ''General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China'', a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|834–835}}

Literature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the [[Victorian era]]. Some works became internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, "Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page."&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunnell|first=Michael O.|last2=Jacobs|first2=James S.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Origins and History of American Children's Literature|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/TRTR.1201/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1002/TRTR.1201|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic of the period is [[Anna Sewell]]'s animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]'' (1877).

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]], creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1910) was the [[Great Maytham Hall]] Garden in Kent. In 1920 [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]].

The Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with [[World War I]] in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before [[World War II]] was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]] in 1926, the first ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' book by [[P. L. Travers]] in 1934, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937, and the Arthurian novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' by [[T. H. White]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-203-16812-7}}, pp. 682-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's [[paperback]] books were first released in England in 1940 under the [[Puffin Books]] imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'', pp. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enid Blyton]]'s books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven]], and [[The Adventure Series]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Sheila G. (1982), ''The Blyton Phenomenon''. Andre Deutsch, {{ISBN|978-0-233-97441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these children's stories, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942.

In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "Inklings". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the author of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is [[Alan Garner]] author of ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of [[Blodeuwedd]] from the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', set in modern [[Wales]], and for it Garner won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.&lt;ref name=medal1967&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 (Carnegie Winner 1967)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106194213/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 |date=2013-01-06 }}.

[[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'' (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' was published in 1956. [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in ''[[No One Must Know]]'' (1962) by [[Barbara Sleigh]] is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.

[[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-man-who-liked-to-make-up-stories-2158052.html Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to make up stories ...] ''[[The Independent]]'' (Sunday, 12 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl was inspired to write ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker [[Willy Wonka]], having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1971), ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' (1983), and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' (1988).

==== Adventure fiction for children ====
Adventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include [[Johann David Wyss]]' ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Frederick Marryat]]'s ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847) and [[Harriet Martineau]]'s ''The Peasant and the Prince'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Hunt, Peter]]. (Editor). ''Children's literature: an illustrated history''. Oxford University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}  (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–100)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W.H.G. Kingston]], [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] and [[G. A. Henty]] specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Butts, Dennis,"Adventure Books" in [[Jack Zipes|Zipes, Jack]], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''. Volume One. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514656-1}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16).&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s (1850–94) classic [[Piracy|pirate]] story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In the years after the First World War, writers such as [[Arthur Ransome]]  (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Brogan, ''The Life of Arthur Ransome''. Jonathan Cape, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biggles]] was a popular series of [[adventure book]]s for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], by [[W. E. Johns]]. Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''[[Light Aircraft Association|Popular Flying]]'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as "[[Worrals]]".

[[Geoffrey Trease]] and [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 1995, (p.&amp;nbsp;208–9)&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] in the [[Sally Lockhart]] novels and [[Julia Golding]] in the [[Cat Royal]] series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==== Magazines and comics ====
An important aspect of British children's literature has been [[comic books]] and [[List of early-20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|magazines]].

Many prominent authors contributed to the ''Boys Own Paper'': [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]] wrote for several issues, along with authors [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[R.M.

The ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|Marcus Morris]], an Anglican vicar from Lancashire.

Children's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that ''A Little Book for Little Children'' was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bingham|author2=Scholt|title=Fifteen Centuries of Children's Literature|date=1980|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-22164-2|pages=99,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous books of American children's literature is [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', published in 1900. "By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure", Connie Epstein in ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'' says Baum "developed an original style and form that stands alone".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in [[North America]] between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, [[Louise Seaman Bechtel]] became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by [[May Massee]] in 1922, and [[Alice Dalgliesh]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479–480}}

The [[American Library Association]] began awarding the [[Newbery Medal]], the first children's book award, in 1922.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldecott Medal]] for illustration followed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldecott Medal Awards |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] about her life on the [[American frontier]], ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' appeared in 1932.&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|471}} In 1937 [[Theodor Seuss Geisel|Dr. Seuss]] published his first book, entitled, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. The [[young adult book]] market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer [[John R. Tunis]]', the novel ''[[Seventeenth Summer]]'' by [[Maureen Daly]], and the ''[[Sue Barton (juvenile series)|Sue Barton]]'' nurse book series by [[Helen Dore Boylston]].&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=Michael|title=Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism|year=2010|publisher=[[ALA Editions]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4RJ8rOTTgC|isbn=978-0-8389-1045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

The already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} In 1952, American journalist [[E. B. White]] published ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', which was described as "one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|467}} [[Maurice Sendak]] illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market "seemed to materialize overnight".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|482}}

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' in 1963 and [[Louise Fitzhugh]]'s ''[[Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86" /&gt;

[[Esther Forbes]] in ''[[Johnny Tremain]]'' (1943) and [[Mildred D. Taylor]] in ''[[Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry]]'' (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in [[Robert Cormier]]'s ''[[After the First Death]]'' in 1979, and warfare in the [[Third World]], as in [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''AK'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's ''[[Chicka Chicka Boom Boom]]'' (1979) presented a new spin on the [[alphabet book]]. [[Laura Numeroff]] published ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'' in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[The Chronicles of Prydain]] (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

=== Continental Europe ===
The period from 1890 until [[World War I]] is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Theodor Kittelsen]], and [[Dikken Zwilgmeyer]] were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by [[George Webbe Dasent]] helped increase the stories' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 705,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is [[Selma Lagerlöf]]s ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. [[Astrid Lindgren]] (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'') and [[Jostein Gaarder]] (''[[Sophie's World]]'') are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although "one of the first mysteries written specifically for children," ''[[Emil and the Detectives]]'' by [[Erich Kästner]], was published in Germany in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Silvey, (editor) (2002). ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;  German writers [[Michael Ende]] (''[[The Neverending Story]]'') and [[Cornelia Funke]] (''[[Inkheart]]'') achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by [[Alois Carigiet]], [[Felix Hoffmann (illustrator)|Felix Hoffmann]], and [[Hans Fischer (painter)|Hans Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 683–685, 399, 692, 697, 750.&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 was the first year of the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]] in Italy, which was described as "the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing".&lt;ref name=bologna&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy {{!}} Bologna Children's Book Fair|url=http://culture360.org/event/italy-bologna-childrens-book-fair/|publisher=Culture360|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.&lt;ref name=bologna /&gt;

Swiss author Marcus Pfister's ''[[Rainbow Fish]]'' series has received international acclaim since 1992.

[[File:Stamp-russia2010-children-books-block.png|thumb|Postal stamp of Russia celebrating children's books.]]

[[Russian folktale]]s were collected by [[Aleksandr Afanasyev]] in his three volume ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', and a selection of these were published in ''Русские детские сказки'' (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, [[literary realism]] and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose ''Russian Reader'' included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist [[Evgenia Tur]] wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while [[Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya]]'s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. [[Vera Zhelikhovsky]], [[Elizaveta Kondrashova]], and [[Nadezhda Lukhmanova]] also wrote for girls during this period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|767}}

Children's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. [[Vasily Avenarius]] wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Alexander Pushkin]] around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. [[Lidia Charskaya]] and {{ill|Klavdiya Lukashevich|ru|Лукашевич, Клавдия Владимировна}} continued the popularity of girls' fiction. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was [[Sherlock Holmes]], and similar stories from detective magazines.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|768}}

The state took control of children's literature during the [[October Revolution]]. [[Maksim Gorky]] edited the first children's, ''Northern Lights'', under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|769}} [[Samuil Marshak]] led that literary decade as the "founder of (Soviet) children's literature".&lt;ref name=shray&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrayer|first=Maxim (editor)|title=An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801–1953|year=2007|publisher=[[M.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the [[USSR Union of Writers]], which served as the writer's organization of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state]] and the police. [[Communism|Communist principles]] like [[Common ownership|collectivism]] and [[solidarity]] became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Pavlik Morozov]]. [[Alexander Belyayev]], who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|770}} According to Ben Hellman in the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories", during the Soviet Period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|771}} More political changes in Russia after [[World War II]] brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|772}}

The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as [[C. S. Lewis]], [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] series.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story "A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado", and was later republished as the first chapter of "Reinações de Narizinho", which is the first novel of the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The main setting is the "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as [[Neverland]], the mythological [[Ancient Greece]], an underwater world known as "Reino das Águas Claras" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The "Sítio" is often symbolized by the character of [[Emilia (Sítio do Picapau Amarelo)|Emília]], Lobato's most famous creation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Christian missionaries]] first established the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|808}} In the latter half of the century, [[Raja Shivprasad]] wrote several well-known books in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|810}} A number of respected [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writers began producing [[Bengali literature]] for children including [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], who translated some stories and wrote others himself. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} [[Behari Lal Puri]] was the earliest writer for children in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] in [[Oriya literature]], who wrote many good books for children, including ''Pari Raija'', ''Kuhuka Raija'', ''Panchatantra'', and ''Adi Jugara Galpa Mala''. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as ''Kapila Deva''. In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing.

Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom.

== Classification ==
Children's literature can be divided into categories, either according to [[Literary genre|genre]] or the intended age of the reader.
[[File:The return of Rama.jpg|thumb|A [[Abanindranath Tagore|Tagore]] illustration of a Hindu myth]]

=== By genre ===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length.  According to Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson 2006&lt;/ref&gt; there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):
* [[Picture books]], including concept books that teach the [[alphabet]] or [[counting]] for example, pattern books, and wordless books.
* [[Literature|Traditional literature]], including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: [[myth]]s, [[fable]]s, [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s
* [[Fiction]], including [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Literary realism|realistic fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]
* [[Non-fiction]]
* [[Biography]] and [[autobiography]]
* [[Poetry]] and verse.

=== By age category ===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:
* [[Picture book]]s, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–5.
* [[Early reader]] books, [[appropriate for children]] ages 5–7.  These books are often designed to help a child build his or her reading skills.
* [[Chapter book]]s, appropriate for children ages 7–12.
** Short chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–9.
** Longer chapter books, appropriate for children ages 9–12.
* [[Young adult fiction]], appropriate for children ages 12–18.

[[File:orbispictus.JPG|thumb|A late 18th-century reprint of ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' by [[Comenius]], the first children's picture book.]]

Pictures have always accompanied children's stories.&lt;ref name=lerer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerer|first=Seth|title=Children's Literature: A Reader's History, from Aesop to Harry Potter|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}} A [[papyrus]] from [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Byzantine Egypt]], shows illustrations accompanied by the story of [[Hercules]]' labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore, Raffaella, ''Gymnastics of the Mind'', pg. 139 [[Princeton University]], 2001, cited in Lerer, Seth, ''Children's Literature'', pg. 22, [[University of Chicago]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern children's books are [[illustration|illustrated]] in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in [[graphic novel]]s. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "an illustrated book differs from a book with [[illustration]]s in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|221}} Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' which was published in 1658 by the [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] author [[Comenius]]. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,''Orbis Pictus'' had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in [[Latin]] and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Early children's books, such as ''Orbis Pictus'', were illustrated by [[woodcut]], and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|322}} Newer processes, including copper and steel [[engraving]] were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of [[Chromolithography]] (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator [[Walter Crane]] refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. [[File:Crane frog4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Crane]]'s [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] illustration for ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', 1874.]]

Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was [[etching]], used by [[George Cruikshank]] in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Kate Greenaway]], and [[John Tenniel]]. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators'' credits Caldecott with "The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|350}}

Twentieth-century artists such as [[Kay Nielson]], [[Edmund Dulac]], and [[Arthur Rackham]] produced illustrations that are still reprinted today.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–227}} Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as [[Brian Wildsmith]]'s were common by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

== Scholarship ==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This [[literary criticism]] may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.

Most educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings.  They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.

[[File:Story of Little Black Sambo.jpg|thumb|1900 edition of the controversial ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]'']]

Popular classics such as ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' have been criticized for their [[racial stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="cracked.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Pippi Longstocking books charged with racism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/pippi-longstocking-books-racism|website=the guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrd|first1=M.

The academic journal ''Children’s Literature Review'' provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist [[Herge]]’s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Tintin|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=114|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of these books include:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Lou lou chez les negres (1929) - lou lou among the blacks
* Baba Diène et Morceau de sucre (1939)
* Original Barbar series promoting the french civilizing mission
* TINTIN au Congo (1931) - Where Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country, Belgium

The picture book ''[[The Snowy Day]]'', written and illustrated by [[Ezra Jack Keats]] was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist.

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In ''Young Children and Picture Books'' discusses damaging stereotypes of [[Native Americans in children's literature]], stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=39|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]’s ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' and [[J.M. Barrie]]’s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' are widely discussed among critics. Wilder’s novel, based on her childhood in America’s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Laura Ingalls Wilder 1867–1957|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=111|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, ''Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook'', writer M.

=== The Empire, imperialism and colonialism ===

The presence of [[empire]] as well as pro-colonialist and [[imperialist]] themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siecle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism.

In the French illustrator [[Jean de Brunhoff]]’s 1931 picture book ''Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], The Little Elephant)'', prominent themes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Babar|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=116|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WIELAND|first1=RAOUL|title=Babar The Elephant – Racism, Sexism, and Privilege in Children’s Storie|url=http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/babar-the-elephant-racism-sexism-and-privilege-hesaid/|website=The Good Men Project|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title=Freeing the Elephants: What Babar brought.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/freeing-the-elephants|website=The New Yorker|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.

=== Gender roles and representation of women ===
Some of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s ''[[Little Women]]'' and [[Frank L. Baum]]’s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. ''Little Women'', a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, [[Matilda Gage]], an important figure in the [[suffragist]] movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]]'s [[Moomin]] series which features strong and individualized female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=18–20, 25–45 &amp; 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of [[feminist children's literature]] as well as a rise in [[gender neutrality]] in children's literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book ''Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics'', scholar [[Alison Lurie]] says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by [[Dr. Seuss]], would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=43 &amp; 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' characters written by [[A. A. Milne]], are primarily male, with the exception of the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], who is a mother to [[Roo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the one hand ''Growing up with Dick and Jane'' highlights the heterosexual, [[nuclear family]] and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kismaric|first1=Carole|last2=Heiferman|first2=Marvin|title=Growing up with Dick and Jane: Learning and Living the American Dream|date=1996|publisher=Collins San Francisco,|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Young Children and Picture Books'', on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and [[sexist]] stereotypes for women.&lt;ref name="Young Children and Picture Books" /&gt;

In her book ''Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium'', professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that [[capitalism]] encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism. London: Routledge|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why are there so few girls in children’s books?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Jennie|last = Yabroff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war.&lt;ref name="Northcote House"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|last2=Fairchild|first2=Emily|last3=Grauerholz|first3=Liz|last4=Pescosolido|first4=Bernice A.|last5=Tope|first5=Daniel|date=31 March 2011|title=Gender in Twentieth-Century Children’s Books:  Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|issn=0891-2432|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books|lay-source=Why are there so few girls in children's books?|lay-date=8 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!'' (1970) by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=I’m Glad I’m a Boy!

In his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book ''The Flying Train'',” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of ''The Flying Train'' – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ghasemi, Mehdi. “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book The Flying Train.” Libri &amp; Liberi, vol. 3 (1), 2014: 43-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over controversial content ===

A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned&lt;ref name="Adios Barbie" /&gt; while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Kavitha|title=Are some children's classics unsuitable for kids?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/childrens-classics-unsuitable-kids|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=How to Read a Racist Book to Your Kids|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-to-read-a-racist-book-to-your-kids.html?_r=3|website=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Children’s Culture Reader'', scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] references [[Herbert Kohl]]’s essay ''Should We Burn Babar?'' which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=The Children's Cultural Reader|date=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator [[Richard Scarry]]’s book ''[[Best Word Book Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Spot the difference: This update to a classic children’s book reimagines gender roles|url=http://qz.com/545860/richard-scarrys-update-to-a-classic-childrens-book-reimagines-gender-roles-for-boys-and-girls/|website=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roald Dahl]]’s book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine" /&gt; In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on early childhood development ===

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'', uses [[psychoanalysis]] to examine the impact that [[fairy tales]] have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=United States|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, author and illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] contends the early viewing of an image in a [[picture book]] leaves an important and lasting impression on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacCann|first1=Donnarae|last2=Richard|first2=Olga|title=The child's first books; a critical study of pictures and texts|date=1973|publisher=Wilson|location=New York|page=1 &amp; 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s literature critic [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an [[ideology]] of the culture it comes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Peter|title=Literature for Children Contemporary Criticism|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|date=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins United Press|location=Baltimore|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes [[capitalism]], in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave.&lt;ref name="Northcote House" /&gt; The "image of childhood"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children "at their most susceptible age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egoff|first1=Sheila A.|title=Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature|date=1981|publisher=American Library Association|location=Chicago, Ill|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Greenaway]]’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In [[Roberta Seelinger Trites]]'s book ''Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature'', she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trites|first1=Roberta Seelinger|title=Disturbing the Universe Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature|date=2000|publisher=U of Iowa|location=Iowa City|page=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism'', researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md}}&lt;/ref&gt; using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Wolfgang Alexander''' (born 4 October 1936 in [[Vienna]], Austria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/ca/ca.html|title=PatternLanguage.com|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/caframe.htm?/../ca/whoswho.htm|title=CA FRAME|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a widely influential [[architect]] and design theorist, and currently [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|emeritus professor]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His theories about the nature of human-centered [[design]] have affected fields beyond architecture, including [[urban design]], [[software]], [[sociology]] and others.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander has designed and personally built over 100 buildings, both as an architect and a general contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/calexander/|title=Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=www.pps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html|title=2009 Scully Prize|author=|date=|website=nbm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the [[pattern language]] movement. The first [[wiki]]—the technology behind [[Wikipedia]]—led directly from Alexander's work, according to its creator, [[Ward Cunningham]].&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki C2 Wiki Front Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns C2 Wiki: People, Projects and Patterns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's work has also influenced the development of [[agile software development]].&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt;

In architecture, Alexander's work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the [[New Urbanist]] movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2009/12/do_you_see_a_pattern.html|title=Do You See a Pattern?|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski|date=2 December 2009|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.&lt;ref name="nikos"&gt;Nikos Salingaros, "[[A Theory of Architecture]]", Umbau-Verlag, Solingen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is known for many books on the design and building process, including ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]], [[A City is Not a Tree]]'' (first published as a paper and recently re-published in book form), ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]], A New Theory of Urban Design,'' and ''[[The Oregon Experiment]].'' More recently he published the four-volume ''[[The Nature of Order]]: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe,'' about his newer theories of "morphogenetic" processes, and ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth'', about the implementation of his theories in a large building project in Japan. All his works are developed or accumulated from his previous works, so his works should be read as a whole rather than fragmented pieces. His life's work or the best of his works is The Nature of Order on which he spent about 30 years, and the very first version of The Nature of Order was done in 1981, one year before this famous debate with Peter Eisenman in Harvard.

Alexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]],'' a perennial seller some four decades after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459281087&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+pattern+language|title=A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|first3=search|last3=results|first4=search|last4=results|first5=Ingrid|last5=Fiksdahl-King|first6=Shlomo|last6=Angel|date=7 June 1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2NSI4vSu_IC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0htfQ-O3KAhVE32MKHYy5BfkQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;f=false|title=The Oregon Experiment|first1=Christopher|last1=Alexander|first2=Professor in the Department of Architecture Christopher|last2=Alexander|first3=Murray|last3=Silverstein|first4=Shlomo|last4=Angel|first5=Sara|last5=Ishikawa|first6=Danny|last6=Abrams|date=7 June 1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUGiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj97JbG9-3KAhUS5GMKHWBkDIUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;f=false|title=How to Study Public Life|first1=Jan|last1=Gehl|first2=Birgitte|last2=Svarre|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Island Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1991-1/the-oregon-experiment-revisited|title=The Oregon Experiment after Twenty Years - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa, [[Murray Silverstein]], Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a "[[pattern language]]" to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.

==Personal life==
As a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2008|title=ARCH+ Zeitschrift für Architektur und Städtebau|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in [[Chichester]] and [[Oxford]], England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He moved to [[Berkeley, California]] in 1963 to accept an appointment as Professor of Architecture, a position he would hold for almost 40 years. In 2002, after his retirement, Alexander moved to [[Arundel]], England, where he continues to write, teach and build. Alexander is married to Margaret Moore Alexander, and he has two daughters, Sophie and Lily, by his former wife Pamela.

==Education==
Alexander attended [[Oundle School]], England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies.

==Honors==
Alexander was elected to the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]], Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/reflections-on-puarl-01062014/christopher-alexander-aia-medal|title=AIA First Medal for Research|author=AIA Journal|date=August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;; elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://acsa-arch.org/programs-events/awards/archives/DP ACSA Archives, Distinguished Professor Award winners.]&lt;/ref&gt; invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded the Seaside Prize, 1994; elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1996;&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt; one of the two inaugural recipients of the Athena Award, given by the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU), 2006;. awarded (''in absentia'') the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]], 2009; awarded the lifetime achievement award by the [[Urban Design Group]], 2011; winner of the [[Global Award for Sustainable Architecture]], 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patternlanguage.com/bios/vitae.htm|title=Curriculum Vitae|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Author===

''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:

{{quote|There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.}}

''[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]'' (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].

The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.

The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.

The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete. It uses [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities.

This book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.

''A New Theory of Urban Design'' (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in [[urbanism]] among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in [[San Francisco]], it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only ''local'' rules, in relation to neighbours. A vastly undervalued part of the Alexander canon, ''A New Theory'' is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the [[shanty town]]s latterly championed by [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 2 of his ''Whole Earth Discipline'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Neuwirth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow Cities: a billion squatters, a new urban world'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="Hanson-Younés"&gt;See Brian Hanson &amp; Samir Younés, "Reuniting Urban Form and Urban Process: The Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force", ''Journal of Urban Design'', v.6, no.2 (June 2001), pp.185-209; Charles, Prince of Wales, speech at the "Traditional Urbanism in Contemporary Practice" conference at The Prince's Foundation, London, 20 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been critical reconstructions of Alexander's design studio based on the theories put forward in ''A New Theory of Urban Design''.&lt;ref name="Warped"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7550339/Warped_educational_strategies_in_simulation_of_practice|title=Gareth Griffiths, "Warped educational strategies in simulation of practice", in ''Nordic Journal of Architectural Research'', 1/2013.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]]'' (2003–04), which includes The ''Phenomenon of Life'', ''The Process of Creating Life'', ''A Vision of a Living World'' and ''The Luminous Ground'', is Alexander's most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in which we view the world in general. The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by more dynamic sequences, which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). Sequences, like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).

The online publication ''Katarxis 3'' (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and [[Peter Eisenman]] from 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm |title=Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture: The 1982 Debate Between Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's latest book, ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems'' (2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies (System B). As Alexander describes it, System A is focused on enhancing the life/spirit of spaces within given constraints (land, budget, client needs, etc.) (drawings are sketches - decisions on placing buildings, materials used, finish and such are made in the field as construction proceeds, with adjustments as needed to meet overall budget); System B ignores, and tends to diminish or destroy that quality (architect responsible for drawings which the builder uses to build structures at the lowest possible cost). In the last few chapters he describes "centers" as a way of thinking about the connections among spaces, and about what brings more wholeness and life to a space.

===Works of architecture===
Among Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near [[Tokyo]] (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth''); the West Dean Visitors Centre &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/westdean.htm England, The West Dean Visitors Centre]'' - Project History&lt;/ref&gt; in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the [[Sala House]] and the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California made of lightweight concrete); the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses''); and several private houses (described and illustrated in ''The Nature of Order''). Alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality (which he used to call "the quality without a name", but named "wholeness" in ''Nature of Order'') that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure. This quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces, and is precisely what Alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories. Paradoxically, achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture, and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present.&lt;ref name="nikos" /&gt;

His former student and colleague [[Michael Mehaffy]] wrote an introductory essay on Alexander's built work in the online publication ''Katarxis 3'', which includes a gallery of Alexander's major built projects through September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery.htm |title=Gallery |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at [[UC Berkeley]] (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales's Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990–1994) and [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architectural-review.com/rethink/viewpoints/lessons-from-prince-charles/8636206.article Architectural Review, September 2012]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated the process which led to the international [[Building Beauty]] post-graduate school for architecture, which launched in Sorrento, Italy for the 2017-18 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buildingbeauty.org/|title=Building Beauty – First Level Master in Architecture|author=|date=|website=buildingbeauty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buildinggreen.com/newsbrief/architecture-hands-search-beauty|title=Architecture as a Hands-on Search for Beauty|author=|date=27 December 2017|website=buildinggreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Architecture===

Alexander's work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are [[Sarah Susanka]],&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Susanka: ''Not So Big House'', Taunton Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1561583766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andres Duany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Duany.htm|title=Andres Duany, Architect and Urban Theorist|author=|date=|website=www.katarxis3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Witold Rybczynski]].&lt;ref name="nbm.org"&gt;http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Campbell (journalist)|Robert Campbell]], the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the ''Boston Globe'', stated that Alexander "has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that's true of a whole generation of people."&lt;ref name="nbm.org"/&gt;

Architecture critic [[Peter Buchanan (architect)|Peter Buchanan]], in an essay for ''[[The Architectural Review]]''{{'}}s 2012 campaign ''The Big Rethink'', argues that Alexander's work as reflected in ''A Pattern Language'' is "thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be." He continues:
{{quote|Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction—although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them. The daunting challenge for architects then, if such a thing is even possible to realise, would be to recreate in a more contemporary idiom both the richness and quality of experience suggested by the pattern language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectural-review.com/the-big-rethink/the-big-rethink-transcend-and-include-the-past/8629373.article?blocktitle=Towards-a-Complete-Architecture&amp;contentID=4950 The Big Rethink: Transcend And include The Past], 24 April 2012 (accessed 5 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many urban development projects continue to incorporate Alexander's ideas. For example, in the UK the developers [[Living Villages]] have been highly influenced by Alexander's work and used ''A Pattern Language'' as the basis for the design of The Wintles in Bishops Castle, Shropshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/24/a-wander-round-the-wintles/|title=A Wander Round the Wintles » Transition Culture|first=Rob|last=Hopkins|date=|website=transitionculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Susanka]]'s "Not So Big House" movement adapts and popularizes Alexander's patterns and outlook.

===Computer science===

Alexander's ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'' was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence&lt;ref name="naur"&gt;{{cite conference | first = H. | last = Kilov | title = Using RM-ODP to bridge communication gaps between stakeholders | booktitle = Communications H Kilov | conference = Workshop on ODP for Enterprise Computing 2004 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.553 | quote = Peter Naur proposed in 1968 to use Christopher Alexander's work… }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and 1970s on [[programming language design]], modular programming, [[object-oriented programming]], [[software engineering]] and other design methodologies. Alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s influential ''A Discipline of Programming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest influence of ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' in computer science is the [[design patterns]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.text.html#COMPUTER |title= Christopher's Alexander's influence on Computer Science |author=Nikos A. Salingaros |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the [[extreme programming]] movement.&lt;ref name="accu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accu.org/index.php/journals/509|title=ACCU  :: eXtreme Programming An interview with Kent Beck|first=ACCU|last=Members|date=|website=accu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiki]] was invented&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"/&gt; to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming [[design patterns]]. More recently the "deep geometrical structures" as discussed in ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' have been cited as having importance for [[object-oriented programming]], particularly in C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/budha/coplien.htm|title=Space:  The Final Frontier|author=|date=|website=www.cs.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] wrote that Alexander's work was influential in the origin of the ''[[SimCity]]'' computer games, and in his later game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconeye.com/architecture/features/item/3261-will-wright-interview|title=Will Wright interview|author=|date=|website=iconeye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander has often led his own software research, such as the 1996 Gatemaker project with [[Greg Bryant (computer scientist)|Greg Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatemaker.org|title=Aspen -- early 1997|author=|date=|website=gatemaker.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/gatemaker|title=Gatemaker: Christopher Alexander's dialogue with the computer industry - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure, so called wholeness, which is defined mathematically, exists in space and matter physically, and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically. He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of ''The Nature of Order''. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in spirit to Google's PageRank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1502.03554 | title=Wholeness as a Hierarchical Graph to Capture the Nature of Space | journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science | volume=29 | issue=9 | pages=1632 | first=Bin | last=Jiang | date=27 March 2015| doi=10.1080/13658816.2015.1038542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The fourth volume of ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter, [[human perception]] of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and [[belief]]s, and recent scientific advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureoforder.com/summarybk4.htm|title=SUMMARY OF BOOK FOUR OF THE NATURE OF ORDER|author=|date=|website=www.natureoforder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his leanings toward [[Deism]], and his naturalistic and anthropological approach to religion, Alexander maintains that he is a practicing member of the [[Catholic Church]], believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals&lt;!-- There is no mention of 'accumulated human truth' or 'rituals' in the linked article. --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden|title=Making the Garden - Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=firstthings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design science===
The life's work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book ''Notes on the Synthesis of Forms'', he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure in ''[[The Nature of Order]]''. The design principles are differentiation and adaptation.

===Complex networks===
In his classic ‘A City is Not a Tree’, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book ‘Notes on the synthesis of forms’ on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004: [[Community structure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The '''coliform index''' is a rating of the purity of [[water]] based on a count of [[feces|fecal]] [[bacteria]]. It is one of many tests done to assure sufficient [[water quality]]. [[Coliform bacteria]] are [[microorganism]]s that primarily originate in the intestines of [[warm-blooded]] animals.  By testing for coliforms, especially the well known ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), which is a thermotolerant coliform, one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with human or animal feces. It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from human and animal feces to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them.   Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water.

The coliform index is used because it is difficult to test for pathogenic bacteria directly.  There are many different types of disease-causing bacteria, and they are usually present in low numbers which do not always show up in tests.  Thermotolerant coliforms are present in higher numbers than individual types of pathogenic bacteria and they can be tested relatively easily.

However, the coliform index is far from perfect.  Thermotolerant coliforms can survive in water on their own, especially in tropical regions, so they do not always indicate fecal contamination.  Furthermore, they do not give a good indication of how many pathogenic bacteria are present in the water, and they give no idea at all of whether there are pathogenic [[virus]]es or [[protozoan|protozoa]] which also cause diseases and are rarely tested for.  Therefore, it does not always give accurate or useful results regarding the purity of water.

The '''Cooperative Institute for Climate and Ocean Research''' (CICOR) formalizes a major collaborative relationship between the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR) and  the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] (WHOI).

CICOR provides a framework at WHOI for coordinating NOAA-funded research and for developing cooperative NOAA-funded research at academic institutions in the [[northeastern United States]].  CICOR also provides NOAA investigators with access to WHOI facilities, including 4 ships and 2 submersibles, and the [[Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility]].

The CICOR research themes are:
* The coastal ocean and near shore processes
* The ocean's participation in climate and climate variability
* Marine ecosystem processes analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9340">[[File:Bagsv2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Jørn Utzon, Bagsvaerd Church (1973–6), Denmark; combinations of local culture and universal civilization.]]
'''Critical regionalism''' is an approach to [[architecture]] that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of identity of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but also rejects the whimsical individualism and ornamentation of [[Postmodern architecture]]. The stylings of critical regionalism seek to provide an architecture rooted in the modern tradition, but tied to geographical and cultural context. Critical regionalism is not simply [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the sense of [[vernacular architecture]]. It is a progressive approach to design that seeks to mediate between the global and the local languages of architecture.

The phrase "critical regionalism" was first used by the architectural theorists [[Alexander Tzonis]] and Liane Lefaivre and, with a slightly different meaning, by the historian-theorist [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Critical Regionalists thus hold that both modern and post-modern architecture are "deeply problematic".&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, "Postmodernism: A Preface", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kenneth Frampton ==
In "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", Frampton recalls [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton's proposal, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture, critically, for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time value should be placed on the geographical context of the building. Emphasis, Frampton says, should be on topography, climate, light; on tectonic form rather than on scenography (i.e. painting theatrical scenery) and should be on the sense of touch rather than visual sense. Frampton draws on [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] for his argument.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Frampton, "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:SaynatsaloTownHall.jpg|thumb|150px|Alvar Aalto, Saynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Finland: the grass steps appeal to the tactile sense.]]

Two examples Frampton briefly discusses are [[Jørn Utzon]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. In Frampton's view, Utzon's [[Bagsværd Church]] (1973–6), near Copenhagen is a self-conscious synthesis between universal civilization and world culture. This is revealed by the rational, modular, neutral and economic, partly prefabricated concrete outer shell (i.e. universal civilization) versus the specially-designed, 'uneconomic', organic, reinforced concrete shell of the interior, signifying with its manipulation of light sacred space and 'multiple cross-cultural references', which Frampton sees no precedent for in Western culture, but rather in the Chinese [[pagoda]] roof (i.e. world culture). In the case of Aalto, Frampton discusses the red brick [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]] (1952), where, he argues, there is a resistance to universal technology and vision, affected by using the tactile qualities of the building's materials.  He notes, for instance, feeling the contrast between the friction of the brick surface of the stairs and the springy wooden floor of the council chamber.

== William J. R. Curtis and Suha Ozkan ==
There have been two different perceptions of Regionalism in architecture. One of which is of Western writers, like [[William J. R. Curtis|Curtis]], whose definitions are not encompassing enough to analyse architectural styles especially in the last two centuries in the Islamic countries, like Iran. However, Ozkan's definition of Regionalism is more objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Theoretical Inapplicability of Regionalism to Analysing Architectural Aspects of Islamic Shrines in Iran in the Last Two Centuries|journal=The Collection of articles of the International Congress of Imam's Descendants (Imamzadegan)|year=2013|volume=4|pages=16–32|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/18145|publisher=The Charity Organisation|location=Esfahan, Iran|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre ==
According to [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]], critical regionalism need not directly draw from the context; rather elements can be stripped of context but used in unfamiliar ways. Here the aim is to make evident a disruption and loss of place, that is already a ''[[fait accompli]]'', through reflection and self-evaluation.

== Critical regionalist architects ==
In addition to Aalto and Utzon, the following architects have used Critical Regionalism (in the Frampton sense) in their work: [[Studio Granda]], [[Mario Botta]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], Mahesh Naik, Sahil Ahmed, [[Mazharul Islam]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], [[Christopher Benninger]], [[Alvaro Siza]], [[Jorge Ferreira Chaves]], [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Geoffrey Bawa]], [[Raj Rewal]], Dharmesh Vadavala, [[Ashok "Bihari" Lall]] Neelkanth Chhaya (Kaka), Soumitro Ghosh, Nisha Mathew Ghosh, [[Ngô Viết Thụ]], [[Tadao Ando]], Mack Scogin / Merrill Elam, [[Glenn Murcutt]], [[Johnsen Schmaling Architects]], [[Ken Yeang]], Philippe Madec, [[William S.W. Lim]], Tay Kheng Soon, [[WOHA]] Architects (Singapore), [[Juhani Pallasmaa]], [[Wang Shu]], [[Juha Leiviskä]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Carlo Scarpa]], Tan Hock Beng. Peter Stutchbury, Lake Flato, Rick Joy, Tom Kundig, and Sverre Fehn. Dimitris &amp; Suzana Antonakakis are the two Greek architects for whom the term was first used by [[Tzonis]] and Lefaivre.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2016). Intersecting Itineraries Beyond the Strada Novissima: The Converging Authorship of Critical Regionalism. Architectural Histories, 4(1), 11. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/ah.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical regionalism has developed into unique sub-styles across the world. [[Glenn Murcutt]]'s simple vernacular architectural style is representative of an Australian variant to critical regionalism. In [[Architecture_of_Singapore|Singapore]], [[WOHA]] has developed a unique architectural vocabulary based on an appreciation of the local climate and culture.

== In cultural studies ==
Subsequently, the phrase "critical regionalism" has also been used in cultural studies, literary studies, and political theory, specifically in the work of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]. In her 2007 work "Who Sings the Nation-State?", co-authored with [[Judith Butler]], Spivak proposes a deconstructive alternative to nationalism that is predicated on the [[deconstruction]] of borders and rigid national identity.&lt;ref name="Spivak on Regionalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/252/spivaks-abstracts.htm|title=Spivak on Regionalism|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Reichert Powell's book ''Critical Regionalism: Connecting Politics and Culture in the American Landscape'' (2007) traces the trajectory of the term critical regionalism from its original use in architectural theory to its inclusion in literary, cultural, and political studies and proposes a methodology based on the intersection of those fields.

'''Cultural psychology '''is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Heine, S. J. (2011). ''Cultural Psychology. ''New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fiske, A.; Kitayama, S.; Markus, H.R.; &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1998). [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/Classes/Readings/Heine2010Cult-Psy.pdf The cultural matrix of social psychology]. In D. Gilbert &amp; S. Fiske &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (4th ed., pp. 915–81). San Francisco: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Shweder]], one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shweder, Richard (1991). Thinking Through Cultures. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-88415-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with other branches of psychology ==
Cultural psychology is often confused with [[cross-cultural psychology]]. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. | last2 = Ruby | first2 = M. B. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 2 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether [[Jean Piaget]]'s stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.R. | last2 = Kitayama | first2 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Culture, Self, and the Reality of the Social | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 277–83 | doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1403&amp;4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including [[social psychology]], [[cultural-historical psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.

== Importance ==

=== Need for expanded cultural research ===
According to [[Richard Shweder]], there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Therefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones.&lt;ref name="schweder84"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Shweder, R.A.|editor2=Levine, R.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Culture theory: Essays on mind, self, and emotion|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the [[indigenous psychology]] approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakkarath, P.|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396430-e-5|chapter=The role of indigenous psychologies in the building of basic cultural psychology|editor=J. Valsiner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|pages=71–95|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research.&lt;ref name="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett, J. J.|year=2008|url=http://facweb.northseattle.edu/kkuwada/Psyc%20200:Fall%202012/article16-1.pdf|title=The neglected 95%: Why American psychology needs to become less American|journal=American Psychologist|volume=63|issue=7|pages=602–614|pmid=18855491|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdest" /&gt; Findings from psychology research utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often labeled as universal theories and are inaccurately applied to other cultures.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = Joseph | year = 2010 | title = Most people are not WEIRD | url = http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jvt002/BrainMind/Readings/Henrich_2010.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 5| page = 29 | doi = 10.1038/466029a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values.&lt;ref name="weirdest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Norenzayan | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The weirdest people in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 61–135 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt; The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the "[[fundamental attribution error]]" or  the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, D.|year=2010|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/media/WEIRDinScience.pdf|title=A WEIRD View of Human Nature|journal=Science |volume=328|issue=25|page=1627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisbettmiyamoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = R. | last2 = Miyamoto | first2 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = The influence of culture: holistic versus analytic perception | citeseerx=10.1.1.87.43 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.004 | pmid=16129648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt;

By studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.

== Mutual constitution ==
Mutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513133-8|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, "...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Southwest|url=https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/index.html?clk=GFOOTER-ABOUT-ABOUT|website=Southwest Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company can ensure the "equal opportunity for learning and personal growth", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure ''safety'' on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a "stable work environment". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:
::Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice. Yale educates aspiring leaders worldwide who serve all sectors of society. We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement|website=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive Example of Mutual Constitution in Society.png|thumb|This image is a representation derived from ideas found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinoba Kitayama.]]
Instead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.

Past research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=Hazel Rose |last2=Kitayama |first2=Shinobu |date=2010 |title=Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=5 |pages=420–430 |doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.

== Criticisms ==

=== Stereotyping ===
One of the most significant themes in recent years has been cultural differences between East Asians and North Americans in [[attention]],&lt;ref name="masuda01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masuda | first1 = T. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.A. | year = 2001 | title = Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans | url = http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 922–34 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 | pmid = 11708567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111518/http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[perception]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = S. | last3 = Kawamura | first3 = T. | last4 = Larsen | first4 = J.T. | year = 2003 | title = Perceiving an object and its context in different cultures: A cultural look at new look | url = http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Students_Post/Slides/kitayama.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 201–06 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.02432 | pmid = 12741741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognition]],&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;Cole, M.

The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to "generalize about human development across nations and continents" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;McNulty, Jennifer (2004, July 26). "[http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/07/531.html Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says.]" University of California: Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.&lt;ref name="wainryb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainryb | first1 = C | year = 2004 | title = The Study of Diversity in Human Development: Culture, Urgencies, and Perils | url = https://psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110173541/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-11-10 | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 131–137 | doi = 10.1159/000077986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty methodology ===
Self-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology.&lt;ref name="masuda01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = Culture and basic psychological processes—Toward a system view of culture: Comment on Oyserman et al | url = http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/indivdualismandcollectivism/culture%20lit/to%20print/Kitayama2002commentsonOyserman.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.89 | pmid = 11843550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Peng | first3 = K. | last4 = Greenholtz | first4 = J. | year = 2002 | title = What's wrong with cross-cultural comparisons of subjective Likert scales: The reference-group problem | url = http://culcog.berkeley.edu/Publications/2002JPSP_referencegroup.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 903–18 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = K. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Wong | first3 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Validity problems of cross-cultural value comparison and possible solutions | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92164/ValidityProblemsComparingValues.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 329–41 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.2.4.329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Cultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.

In fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett &amp; Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]] theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners.&lt;ref name="nisbett96" /&gt; In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural psychology|last = Heine|first = Steven|publisher = W.

Quantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Culture Outside the Head: A Meta-Analysis of Individualism—Collectivism in Cultural Products|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/199|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18544712|pages = 199–221|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308318260|first = Beth|last = Morling|first2 = Marika|last2 = Lamoreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao &amp; Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture–gene coevolution of individualism–collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1681/529|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2010-02-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 2842692|pmid = 19864286|pages = 529–537|volume = 277|issue = 1681|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1650|first = Joan Y.|last = Chiao|first2 = Katherine D.|last2 = Blizinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811906009189|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2007-02-01|pages = 1310–1316|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047|first = Ying|last = Zhu|first2 = Li|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jin|last3 = Fan|first4 = Shihui|last4 = Han|pmid=17134915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural models ==

"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life." Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Fryberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fryberg | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Markus | first2 = H.R. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural models of education in American Indian, Asian America, and European American contexts | url = | journal = Social Psychology of Education | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1381–2890 | doi = 10.1007/s11218-007-9017-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4 I's culture cycle ===

The 4 I's cultural model was developed by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and Alana Conner in their book ''Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.'' In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a "culture cycle." The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.&lt;ref name="Markus"&gt;Markus, H. R., &amp; Conner, A. C. (2013). Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are. New York: Penguin (Hudson Street Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals ====
The first "I" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as "independent", "equal", and "individualistic". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation.  When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as "energetic", "friendly", or "hard-working". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as "obligated to society", "interdependent", and "considerate". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as "I try not to upset anyone," or "I am a father, a son, and a brother."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Heine, S. (2011). Cultural Psychology. San Francisco: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interactions ====
Interactions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying "No Smoking".  These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.

==== Institutions ====
The next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During "birthday month celebration," for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Whiting model ===
John and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at [[Harvard University]], developed the "Whiting model" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.&lt;ref name="Worthman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthman | first1 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Evolving Models for Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 546–562 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitings coined the term "cultural learning environment", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Carolyn P. and Bloch, M. (2010). "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&amp;context=psychfacpub The Whitings' Concepts of Culture and How They Have Fared in Contemporary Psychology and Anthropology]." Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology.Paper 501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being "characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior".&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Berry, Ype H. Poortinga, Marshall H. Segall, Pierre R. Dasen, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Cross-Cultural Psychology: Research and Applications: Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model,&lt;ref name="Worthman" /&gt; and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', "All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisner | first1 = T.S. | year = 2010 | title = John and Beatrice Whiting's Contributions to the Cross-Cultural Study of Human Development: Their Values, Goals, Norms, and Practices | url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/499.full.pdf+html | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 499–509 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and motivation ==

=== Self-enhancement vs. self-improvement ===
While self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heine|first=Steven|date=1999|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|url=|journal=2017 American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2007/06/07/high-self-esteem-may-be-culturally-universal-international-study-shows/|title=High self-esteem may be culturally universal, international study shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunji|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Positive Self-Evaluation on Cross-Cultural Differences in Well-Being|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include [[Social comparison theory|downward social comparison]], compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, [[Attribution (psychology)|external attributions]] and [[basking in reflected glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Psychology|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Steven J. |last2=Raineri |first2=Andres |title=Self-Improving Motivations and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=January 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=158–163 |doi=10.1177/0022022108326193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and empathy ==

=== Cultural orientation: collectivistic and individualistic ===
A main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prooijen|first1=J.|title=Individualistic and social motives for justice judgments|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=1299|issue=1|pages=60–67|doi=10.1111/nyas.12143|pmid=25708080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Hui (1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=C.H.|title=Measurement of individualism-collectivism|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1988|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The [[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental Attribution Error]] has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic).&lt;ref name="Ross (1977)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross|authorlink1=L.|editor1-last=Berkowitz|editor1-first=L.|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|edition=4th|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, the [[self-serving bias]] was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashima|first1=Y.|authorlink2=Harry C. Triandis|last2=Triandis|first2=H.C.|title=The self-serving bias in attributions as a coping strategy: A cross-cultural study|journal=Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology|date=1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1177/0022002186017001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/resources/transcripts/DiscoveringPsychology/26CulPsych.pdf|title=Discovering Psychology: Cultural Psychology|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=|website=Learner.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=G.|title=Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empathy across cultures ===
These differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill&lt;ref name="Duan &amp; Hill (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Hill|first2=C.E.|title=The current state of empathy research|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1996|volume=43|issue=3|pages=261–74|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy&lt;ref name="Soto &amp; Levenson (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soto|first1=J.A.|last2=Levenson|first2=R.W.|title=Emotion recognition across culture: The influence of ethnicity on empathic accuracy and physiological linkage|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1037/a0017399|pages=874–884|pmc=2877627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional empathy:  taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang&lt;ref name="Duan, Wei, &amp; Wang (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Wei|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=The role of individualism-collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Counseling|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=57–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.&lt;ref name="Kitayama &amp; Markus (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Markus|first2=H.R.|title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural and ethnocultural empathy ===
Cultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Ridley &amp; Lingle (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ridely, C.R.|author2=Lingle, D.W.|editor1-last=Pedersen|editor1-first=P.B.|editor2-last=Draguns|editor2-first=J.G.|title=Counseling Across Culture|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousands Oaks: CA|chapter=Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been further developed with the concept of [[ethnocultural empathy]].&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.W.|last2=Blier|first2=J.|last3=Davidson|first3=M.|last4=Savoy|first4=H.|last5=Tan|first5=J.|last6=Tan|first6=J.|last7=Yakushka|first7=O.|title=The scale of ethnocultural empathy: Development, validation, and reliability|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2003|volume=2|pages=221–234|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.50.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyche|first1=L.|last2=Zayas|first2=L.H.|title=Cross-cultural empathy and training the contemporary psychotherapist|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=245–258|doi=10.1023/A:1010407728614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck&lt;ref name="Eysenck (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=M.|title=Psychology: A student's handbook|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press LTD}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen&lt;ref name="Raosal, Eklund, &amp; Hansen (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raosal|first1=C.|last2=Eklund|first2=J.|last3=Hansen|first3=E.M.|title=Toward a conceptualization of ethnocultural empathy|journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1037/h0099278}}&lt;/ref&gt; posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:

Paucity of:
* (general) knowledge outside one's own culture
* (general) experience with other cultures outside one's own
* (specific) knowledge regarding other people's cultures
* (specific) experiences regarding other people's cultures

and:
* inability to bridge different cultures by understanding the commonalities and dissimilarities

These five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.

Another barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy.  One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeTurk|first1=S.|title=Intercultural empathy: Myth, competency, or possibility for alliance building?|journal=Communication Building|date=2001|volume=50|issue=4|pages=374–384|doi=10.1080/03634520109379262}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)" /&gt; The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.

Four important facets of cultural empathy are:&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;
* Taking the perspective of someone from a different culture
* Understanding the verbal/behavioral expression that occurs during ethnocultural empathy
* Being cognizant of how different cultures are treated by larger entities such as the job market and the media
* Accepting differences in cultural choices regarding language, clothing preference, food choice, etc.

These four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)" /&gt; Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.&lt;ref name="Sue &amp; Sue (1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue|first1=D.W.|last2=Sue|first2=D.|title=Barriers to effective cross-cultural counseling|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=5|pages=420–429|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.24.5.420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on intercultural competence, see [[intercultural competence]].

'''Diocletian windows''', also called '''thermal windows''', are large semicircular windows characteristic of the enormous [[public bath]]s (''[[thermae]]'') of [[Ancient Rome]]. They have been revived on a limited basis by some [[neo-classical architecture|classical revivalist architects]] in more modern times.

==Description==
Diocletian windows are large segmental arched [[window]]s (or other openings) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two vertical [[mullion]]s. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.&lt;ref name=pevsner1&gt;{{cite book|title=Pevsner's Architectural Glossary|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16721-4|editor=Bradley, Simon|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
Diocletian windows are named after the windows found in the [[Baths of Diocletian|Thermae (Baths) of Diocletian]] (AD 302) in [[Rome]]. (The Thermae is now the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].) The variant name, thermal window, also comes from their association with the Thermae of Diocletian.

== Influence ==
[[File:Penn Station3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A five-light variant of the thermal window is seen on the old [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York City (''circa'' 1911).]]

This type of window was revived and used in Italy in the 16th century, especially by [[Andrea Palladio]]. Palladio and others incorporated an elongated Diocletian window in the form of an arched central light flanked by narrower, square-headed apertures. This combination became known as a [[Palladian architecture#The Palladian window|Palladian, or Venetian, window]].

The Diocletian window was much used in the early 18th century by the English architect [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164082/Diocletian-window www.britannica.com- Diocletian Window]&lt;/ref&gt; 3rd [[Earl of Burlington]], one of the originators of the [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival (neo-Palladian)|English Palladian style]], and by his followers.

Diocletian windows continued to be used occasionally in large public buildings in the various devolutions of [[neoclassical architecture]] including the [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]] (1880–1920).

'''Geodiversity''' is the variety of earth materials, forms and processes that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski&gt;Zwolinski, Zb. 2004. ''Geodiversity'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'', A.Goudie (ed.), Routledge: pp. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relevant materials include [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[soil]]s and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brilha2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brilha |first1=José |date=2014 |title=Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review |url= |journal=Geoheritage |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1007/s12371-014-0139-3 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms may comprise [[fold (geology)|folds]], [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[landform]]s and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example [[tectonics]], [[sediment transport]], [[pedogenesis]]) represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, M. 2004. ''Geodiversity: Valuing and Conserving Abiotic Nature''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd {{ISBN|978-0470848951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of [[Geology of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]]) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a [[Geoethics|geoethical]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), "[http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6099 Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges]". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. doi: 10.4401/ag-6099.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to José Brilha geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ''[[ex situ]]''. Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ''ex situ''.&lt;ref name=Brilha2014/&gt;

Guerrilla (Spanish for "little war"), as applied to theatrical events, describes the act of spontaneous, surprise performances in unlikely public spaces to an unsuspecting audience. Typically these performances intend to draw attention to a political/social issue through [[satire]], [[protest]], and carnivalesque techniques. Many of these performances were a direct result of the radical [[social movement]]s of the late 1960s through mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster’s College Dictionary. New York: Random House, 1992, pp.593&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla Theater, also referred to as guerrilla performance, has been sometimes related to the [[agitprop theater]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Filewod03"&gt;Filewod, Alan (2003) ''Modernism and Genocide'', in Richard Paul Knowles, William B.

==Origins==
The term ''Guerrilla Theater'' was coined by Peter Berg, who in 1965 suggested it to [[R.G. Davis]] as the title of his essay on the actions of the  [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], an essay that was first published in 1966.&lt;ref name="BraunsteinDoyle02"&gt;Peter Braunstein, Michael William Doyle (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R178zShWUtIC ''Imagine nation: the American counterculture of the 1960s and '70s''], p.93 note #9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"&gt;{{cite book

Republished in ''[[The SFMT]]'', 149-53. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisRethinking"&gt;Davis (1971) ''Rethinking guerrilla theater, 1971, 1985'' in Donald Lazere [https://books.google.com/books?id=pT8X-YnxOHwC ''American media and mass culture: left perspectives'']  p.599&lt;/ref&gt; The term "guerrilla" was inspired by a passage in a 1961 [[Che Guevara]] essay, which read:&lt;ref name="Gordon07"&gt;Gordon, Kelly Carolyn (2007) ''Guerrilla theater'', in Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1''], pp.568-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernesto Guevara]] ''Guerrilla Warfare'', Thomas M. Davies, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8420-2678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The guerrilla fighter needs full help from the people.... From the very beginning he has the intention of destroying an unjust order and therefore an intention... to replace the old with something new.}}

Davis had studied [[Mime artist|mime]] and modern dance in the 1950s and had discovered [[commedia dell'arte]]. In autumn 1966 around 20 members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe broke off and started their own collective called [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]], who took their name from [[Diggers|a group of 17th century radicals in England]].

== Guerrilla theater in practice ==

Guerrilla theater shares its origins with many forms of political protest and street theatre including [[agitprop]] (agitation-propaganda), [[carnival]], [[parades]], [[Procession|pageants]], [[political protest]], [[performance art]], [[happening]]s, and, most notably, the Dada movement and [[street art|guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;Random House ''Webster's College Dictionary''.  New York: Random House, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this movement is widely studied in Theater History classrooms, the amount of research and documentation of guerrilla theater is surprisingly lacking.  The term, "Guerrilla Theater" seems to have emerged during the mid-1960s primarily as an upshot of activist [[Radical Theater]] groups such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], El [[Teatro Campesino]], and the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Cruz, Jan, ed.  ''Radical Street Performance''.  New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has important roots in [[Allan Kaprow]]'s "happenings".

The first widely documented guerrilla performances were carried out under the leadership of [[Abbie Hoffman]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies).  One of their most publicized events occurred on August 24, 1967, at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] where Hoffman and other Yippies threw dollar bills onto the trading floor below.  Creating a media frenzy, the event was publicized internationally.  In his later publication, ''Soon to be a Major Motion Picture'' (1980), Hoffman refers to his television appearances with specially planned subversive tactics as "guerrilla theater."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar.  ''History of the Theatre''.  7th ed.  Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pg. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla theater was used as a protest demonstration by the anti-war organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. An article from the summer of 1971 published in the glossy magazine ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' detailed one such performance in [[Washington, D.C.]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A squad of soldiers moved through the part adjoining the U.S. Capitol. They were grubby looking troopers, clad in jungle fatigues and "boonie hats" with wide brims turned up. Jumping a low fence, they began shouting at a group of tourists. 'All right. Hold it. Hold it. Nobody move. Nobody move.' Their voices were full of tension and anger. A man broke out of the crowd and started running. Several soldiers fired at once, and the man fell, clutching his stomach. Blood could be seen on the clean sidewalk. The tourists turned away in horror. 'Get a body count,' a soldier yelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Another squad of soldiers emerged from under the Capitol steps. 'All right. ID. ID,' they screeched. 'You got no ID and you [[Viet Cong|VC]].' They quickly grabbed a young woman and led her away, binding her wrists behind her back and prodding her with their rifles.... They grabbed [a] young man and threw him on the ground, tying his hands behind his back. Several of the soldiers kicked him, seeming to aim for his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Then someone took out a long, thick hunting knife and lifted up the man's shirt, holding the knife to his bare stomach, and pushed against it slightly. 'You VC? You VC?' The man said nothing. He was pushed to his feet and shoved down again. Then he was told to get up. This time the knife was pushed to the side of his neck, and the same question was repeated. Still no answer. The man was dragged away.... Then the soldiers left, and a smaller, less angry group of men dressed in khaki fatigues passed out leaflets to the astonished tourists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"''"A US Infantry platoon just passed through here!"'' the pink colored piece of paper read in big bold letters. ''"If you had been Vietnamese... We might have burned your house. We might have shot your dog. We might have shot you... HELP US END THE WAR BEFORE THEY TURN YOUR SON INTO A BUTCHER OR A CORPSE."''&lt;ref&gt;Art Goldberg, "Vietnam Vets: The Anti-War Army," ''Ramparts,'' vol. 10, no. 1 (July 1971), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Post-1970s performance theater==

Another guerrilla performance group that continued the use of the term was the [[Guerrilla Girls]].  This group of feminist artist-activists was established in New York City in 1985 with the purpose of bringing attention to the lack of female artists in major [[art galleries]] and [[museum]]s.  The Guerrilla Girls began their work through guerrilla art tactics which broadened to include guerrilla theater.  Some common practices in their guerrilla theater techniques that have been replicated by other groups include appearing in costume, using assumed names, and disguising their identity.

==Guerrilla theater groups==

The origins and legacy of guerrilla theater can be seen in the work of these political/performance groups:

* [[ACT UP]]
* [[Billionaires for Bush]]
* [[Billionaires for Wealthcare]]
* [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]
* [[The Church of Euthanasia]]
* [[Circus Amok]]
* [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]
* [[El Teatro Campesino]]
* [[Free Southern Theater]]
* [[Reclaim the Streets]]
* [[Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping]]
* [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]
* [[Situationism]]
* [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]
* [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies)
* [[FEMEN]]

The '''I Look Like an Engineer''' movement was created in August 2015 by software developer [[Isis Anchalee]] (formerly Isis Wenger) as a response to the backlash the [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad in which she was featured received. The movement aspired to break the [[stereotype]]s and promote diversity around [[Minority group|unrepresented groups]], particularly (Women, POC, and LGBTQ+) within the engineering industry. Its primary tactic is the use of the [[hashtag]] #ILookLikeAnEngineer on social media sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]], along with pictures of engineers or engineering students.

The I Look Like an Engineer movement has sparked other similar movements that also seek to break stereotypes in their industry, such as I Look Like a Surgeon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/surgeon-hashtag-takes-highlighting-women-article-1.2325102|title=‘I Look Like a Surgeon’ hashtag takes off after ‘I Look Like an Engineer’ movement that celebrated women in STEM|website=New York Daily News|publisher=New York Daily News|last1=Engel|first1=Meredith|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Look like a Professor and I Look Like a Civil Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|title=Diversity in Civil Engineering – I Look Like a Civil Engineer|website=www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OneLogin campaign ==
In the summer of 2015 [[OneLogin]], a software company in San Francisco created a recruitment campaign aimed at attracting engineers to their home office in San Francisco. Four employees were invited to participate, including Anchalee. The ads were placed in the BART public transit stations and showed several OneLogin engineers sharing their experience working for the company. The ad featuring Anchalee went viral on several social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33783007|title=What does an engineer look like?|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-look-like-an-engineer_us_55c0be70e4b06363d5a35cfd|title=#ILookLikeAnEngineer Destroys The Tech Nerd Stereotype|last=Fellow|first=Lorenzo Ligato Editorial|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2015-08-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/hashtag-aims-to-break-gender-stereotypes-in-engineering.html|title=Woman Behind #ILookLikeAnEngineer Says Campaign Against Gender Stereotypes Is ‘Long Overdue’|last=Varn|first=Kathryn|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the launch of the campaign went viral, OneLogin posted an article on their blog that talked about the importance of diversity, inclusion, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/we-are-onelogin|title=We are OneLogin - OneLogin|website=OneLogin|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement beginnings ==
The [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad featuring Isis Anchalee went viral as her particular ad received comments stating the belief that she was a model and not an actual engineer. Anchalee took to [https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.o1j97etct social media] where she posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper describing her job and a caption with the hashtag, #ILookLikeanEngineer. In her post she stated her belief that it is important to raise awareness in tech diversity and break the stereotypes of what an engineer should look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lien|first1=Tracy|title=Think you know what an engineer looks like? #ilooklikeanengineer says think again|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-i-look-like-an-engineer-20150804-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tyler|first1=Carolyn|title=BAY AREA WOMAN CHALLENGES ENGINEER STEREOTYPES IN NEW AD CAMPAIGN|url=http://abc7news.com/technology/bay-area-woman-challenges-engineer-stereotypes-in-campaign/905064/|website=[[ABC 7 News]]|publisher=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her post started the hashtag trend and the hashtag was used 86,000 times by August 7, 2015. The hashtag has been used in approximately 50 countries.

== Support ==
In an effort to make a lasting impact, Michelle Glauser (the spouse of Anchalee co-worker) began a fundraising campaign using [[Indiegogo]] to create billboards with pictures that people had shared on social media using the hashtag #ILookLikeanEngineer. The proceeds were used to put up more billboards to further the I Look Like an Engineer campaign and excess proceeds were used to fund organizations that teach programming to minorities. The fundraiser’s goal was to raise $3,500. The campaigned ended on September 5, 2015 with $47,285 raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/let-s-put-up-an-ilooklikeanengineer-billboard#/|title=Let's Put Up An #ILookLikeAnEngineer Billboard|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, an [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ilooklikeanengineer-community-gathering-tickets-18026391422 #ILookLikeanEngineer community gathering] organized by Michelle Glauser through Eventbrite as part of efforts to continue further the movement was hosted on August 13, 2015 in San Francisco, CA. During the gathering, photographers collected portraits of willing participants for the billboards and as an effort to document the event. The event was sponsored by Segment, [[Rackspace]], [[OneLogin]], and [https://hackbrightacademy.com/ HackBright Academy]. The event included networking, discussions and a Q&amp;A panel which included [https://twitter.com/isisAnchalee Isis Wenger], [https://twitter.com/AliciaMorga Alicia Morga], [https://twitter.com/waynesutton Wayne Sutton], [https://twitter.com/EricaJoy Erica Baker], [https://twitter.com/shaft Leslie Miley], and [https://twitter.com/Itshella_dom Dom DeGuzman].

== Significance ==
The struggles that women face in the field of engineering have a long-documented history. In the postwar era, female engineering students found themselves in a mixture of conflicting and positive situations that shaped not only their professional experiences but the field itself. Women faced backlash from not just male students and professors who objectified and viewed female engineers as potential girlfriends instead of fellow students, but also from women faculty or older female students who demanded that younger women endured the same struggles they did.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girls Coming to Tech|last=Bix|first=Amy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262019545|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus and corporate climate did not change until the mid-1970s when companies began to face civil rights pressure to be more inclusive of female engineers. However, even with these radical changes women continued to experience subtle and overt forms of discrimination in the workplace. During the 1970s, organizations like the [[Society of Women Engineers]] (founded in 1952) among others provided women with support and guidance both on college campuses and in the corporate world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recognizing the challenges that women faced and continue to face in male-dominated fields raises awareness about the importance of diversity and intersectionality in the field of engineering and other tech fields. Social movements are taking place in online spaces more frequently as the community of users tends to be wider and more diverse. It is here where users can use their own personal experiences and public outcry to start global dialogues that can enact change.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Impurities''' are [[chemical substance]]s inside a confined amount of [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[solid]], which differ from the [[chemical composition]] of the material or compound.

Impurities are either naturally occurring or added during [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of a chemical or commercial product. During production, impurities may be purposely, accidentally, inevitably, or incidentally added into the substance.

The levels of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms.  [[standardization|Standards]] have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product.  Strictly speaking, then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material.

==Destructive impurities== 

Impurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material. Examples include [[wiktionary:ash|ash]] and [[debris]] in [[metals]] and leaf pieces in blank white papers. The removal of impurities is usually done chemically. For example, in the manufacturing of [[iron]], calcium carbonate is added to the [[blast furnace]] to remove [[silicon dioxide]] from the [[iron ore]]. [[Zone refining]] is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors.

However, some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means. A mixture of water and [[salt]] can be separated by [[distillation]], with water as the distillate and salt as the solid [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]. Impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases. Removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids.

No matter what method is used, it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material. The reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Removing impurities completely means reducing the [[entropy]] of the system to zero. This would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. What technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible.

==Impurities and nucleation==
When an impure liquid is cooled to its [[melting point]] the liquid, undergoing a [[phase transition]], [[crystal]]lizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid. If there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be [[supercooled]] below its melting point without becoming a solid. This occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid. The solid is eventually formed when [[dynamic arrest]] or [[glass transition]] occurs, but it forms into an [[amorphous solid]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[glass]], instead, as there is no [[long-range order]] in the structure.

Impurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions.   For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys.  Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned [[Kondo effect]] where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom.    Magnetic impurities in [[superconductors]] can serve as generation sites for [[vortex]] defects.   Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in [[ferromagnet]]s and dramatically affect their [[coercivity]].  In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for [[phase transition]]s because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain]] of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.

==Types of marriage==

===Nikāḥ===
[[Image:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|A Muslim bride signing the '''nikkah nama''' or marriage certificate]]
{{Main article|Nikah}}
''nikāḥ'' (Arabic: نكاح, literally, "to collect and bind together")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp Nikah.com Information: Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the first&amp;mdash;and most common&amp;mdash;form of marriage for [[Muslim]]s. It is described in the Qur'an in Surah 4:4.&lt;ref name="Q44"&gt;{{cite quran|4|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations:
*While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the ''[[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]]'' process or the wife seeking a ''[[Khula]]''.
*The couple inherit from each other.
*A legal [[contract]] is signed when entering the marriage. However it is not a requirement that the contract be in writing, it may be oral especially amongst illiterates; and if an agreed end-date is specified in the nikāḥ contract:
**In [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jurisprudence, the contract is invalid.
**In [[Shia Islam|Shia]] jurisprudence, the contract defines a temporary marriage, ''nikāḥ mut'ah''.
{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated that prophet said, "fornicatoresses are those who marry without proof." (Tirmidhi vol. 2 book 6 no.1103)}}
Requirement of witnesses:
*two (2) witnesses from both sides&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html Witnesses for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110182956/http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permission from [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Wali]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm Nikah without Parents' Knowledge?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133650/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sunni: Compulsory ([[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]) ''or'' Strongly recommended ([[Hanafi]])
*Shia: Depending on the scholar, it is either obligatory or obligatory based on precaution.

===Nikāḥ mut‘ah===
{{Main article|Nikah mut‘ah}}
''nikāḥ mut‘ah'' (Arabic: نكاح متعة, temporary marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |website=Answering-Ansar.org |title=Mut'ah, a comprehensive guide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224032516/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |archivedate=2008-02-24 |date=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, There is controversy on the Islamic legality of this type of marriage, since Sunnis believe it was abrogated by Muhammad or Umar.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhara&lt;/ref&gt;while Shias do not hold this. According to Shia Hadith: Ali (r) said ‘Had Umar not banned Mut’ah then the only person to fornicate would have been a disgraceful person, since Mut’ah is easy, and one can attain the objective, there would have then been no need to indulge in haraam acts. It is clear that if Mut’ah’s abrogation was Sahih then Jabir would not have opposed Omar, and that if Islamic prophet outlawed it, the Companions would not have practiced it during the reign of Abu Bakr. Someone asked Abdullah bin Umar (about Mut’ah) saying: ‘Your father prohibited it. (Ibn Umar replied): ‘Is the order of the Messenger of Allah, more deserving to be followed, or the order of my father?’ [http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/mutah/umar-banned-mutah.html].

''However, similar to normal marriages that are common among Sunnis and Shi'ias, the woman still is given her ''[[mahr]]'',and the woman must still observe the ''[[iddah]]'', a period of time where the woman cannot remarry. This is to ensure that there is no pregnancy from the ex-husband and thus clarifies paternal lineage.''

Quran 4:24 (Pickthall)- And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-24/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 24 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ misyar===
{{Main article|Nikah Misyar}}
nikāḥ Misyaar is a nikāḥ in Sunni's carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of [[polygamy]], the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (''"[[nafaqa]]"''), and the husband's right of homekeeping, and access etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |first=Yusuf |last=Al-Qaradawi |title=Misyar marriage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |archivedate=2011-01-04 |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period. Allowing both husband and wife aware of a separation date, prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah Scholars have said it is permissible to marry a Woman with the intention of getting divorced, If the Wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misyar_marriage]

===Nikah Istibdaa===
It is a marriage ( نکاح استبضاع) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Bukhari 5127 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ Shighār===
It is marriage (نکاح شغار) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close  women for marriage without paying [[Mahr]]. It was prohibited by [[Muhammad]]. &lt;ref&gt; sahih Bukhari 6960 &lt;/ref&gt;
=== Nikāḥ ijtimaa===
{{main article|Nikah Ijtimah}}
This is polyandrous marriage, in which up to ten men would have sexual relations with the same woman at around the same time. When she bore a child she would call all the men and attribute paternity of the child to a man of her choosing. This practice was eradicated by Islam.

===Interfaith marriage===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}

Muslim males may marry a non-Muslim female, specifically, one from the "[[People of the Book]]", which includes [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Conversion is optional for the woman,  but she is nonetheless charged with having a proper understanding of her respective faith as well as engaging in its true and thorough practise. Muslim women have generally forbidden from marrying non-Muslims by some interpretations. But today, more and more scholars have been questioning this ages-long assumption.

==Restrictions on marriage==

===Polygyny===
{{Main article|Polygyny in Islam}}
[[Muslim]] men are allowed to practise [[polygyny]], that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per [[Sura]] 4 Verse 3. A man does not need approval of his first wife for a second marriage as there is no evidence in the Qur'an or hadith to suggest this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#18._SECOND_MARRIAGE_WITHOUT_FIRST_WIFE_CONSENT_ Section 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/61 Validity of second marriage without consent of first]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=82068 IslamWeb Fatwa Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; The only requirement is to create fairness among his wives and to never hurt one wife to please another as this would be unjust. If this requirement cannot be fulfilled, then he can only marry one woman.

[[Polyandry]], the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage. The Quran states: (30:21): “And among His signs is that He has created for you, from your selves, mates, that you may incline towards them and find rest in them, and He has engendered love and tenderness between you. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.”

===Permissible age===
''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams)  (''[[baligh]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the Everyday World: Public Policy Dilemmas{{snd}} Page 102, Sohrab Behdad, Farhad Nomani, Farhad Nomani{{snd}} 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#4._MARRIAGE_AGE_ Requirement for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}
Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur'an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the [[People of the Book]], a term which includes [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|5|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.com/oninma.html |title=On Christian Men marrying Muslim Women |accessdate=2008-01-20 |last=El Fadl |first=Abou |year=2006 |work=Scholar of the House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arranged and forced marriages===
An [[Arranged marriage|engagement may be arranged]] between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (''[[wali]]''), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or [[forced marriage|performed under coercion]] is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family's custody and be transferred to her husband's custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad:

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said "But I am your brother." The Prophet said, "You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry."

however; evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]

It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission." [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid;the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

===Adulterers===
Islam does not give [[Adultery|adulterous]] men the right to marry a [[Chastity|chaste]] woman and nor may an adulterous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|221|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], [[Mizan]], Chapter:The Social Law of Islam, [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity|{{cite quran|24|26|style=ref}}}}

===Other===
A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary ([[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]).

Recognition or celebration of same-sex marriage is completely unjustified in the view of Islamic law. [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam forbids homosexuality]] in Qur'anic injunctions and Islamic tradition.

A marriage is registered by the ''[[Qadi]]'' who performs the short ceremony.

Unlike the [[wedding ring]] in Western societies, there is no visible sign worn to show a woman or a man is married. However, some Muslims have found the wedding ring to be a non-religious tradition and have used a ring.

===Mahr===
{{Main article|Mahr}}
Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a [[bride price]], however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father.  Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses.

===Islamic marriage contract===
{{Main article|Islamic marriage contract}}
The purpose, rules, and regulations of the [[Islamic marriage contract]]. A Muslim marriage is not a ''sacrament'', but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the Nikah, ''marriage ceremony'' is the signing of the marriage contract itself.

Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], while Shia will have their own collections, for example [[Kitab al-Kafi|Furu al-Kafi]], thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place.

Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, however the dissolution of the contract [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]], is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort.

==Walima==
{{main article|Walima}}
The [[Walima]] is a dinner given by the groom's side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong [[sunnah]] (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah.

==Behavior within marriage==

===Spousal rights and obligations===
{{Main article|Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam}}
Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife.

[[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar]] narrated:
{{quote|The Prophet said, "All of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards. The ruler is a guardian and the man is a guardian of his family; the lady is a guardian and is responsible for her husband's house and his offspring; and so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards."|Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 62, Number 128}}

It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness.

====Separate accommodation for wife====
The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not like to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband's father, mother and siblings.

Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges."[Sahih Bukhari]

This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;after his marriage he moves out of his father's house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parent's house, as "a man is a guardian of his father's property". So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learndeen.com/jm/blog/85-razi-blog/183-rights-of-spouses-and-issues-in-joint-family-system.html Rights of Spouses and issues with joint family]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
{{Main article|Islamic sexual jurisprudence}}
Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur'an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage.

[[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud]] narrated:
{{quote|We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Apostle said, "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual desire."|Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614011220/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.086 |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from [[God]] as doing the opposite; i.e.,&amp;nbsp;satisfying sexual needs through illicit means has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime [[Fasting#Islam|fasting]] (see [[sawm]]) and [[menstruation]]) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. [[Islamic views on anal sex|Anal sex]] with one's wife is also strictly prohibited.

Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled “Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom”, by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, May 2, 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts" &gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html ], 100 Interesting Facts About …&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery.

===Gender roles===
The Qur'an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/3/36 "And the male is not like the female."]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife.

Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are:
* The right to enjoy each other.
* The right to inherit from each other.
* The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children.

Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are:
* The dower (Mahr)
* Support
* Kind and proper treatment&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 2: The Duties of Men |url=https://www.al-islam.org/principles-marriage-family-ethics-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/part-2-duties-men}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marital relations
* Not to be beaten on face
* Privacy
* Justice between multiple wives
* To be taught her religion
* Defense of her honor&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;

Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are:

* Being head of the household
* To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah
* Marital relations
* That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves
* That she not leave the house without his permission
* That she protect his property
* To be thanked for his efforts
* That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission

These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_8.php Rights of spouses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#15.

'''The Jewish People Policy Institute''' ('''JPPI'''; {{lang-he|המכון למדיניות העם היהודי}}; formerly: '''The Jewish People Policy Planning (JPPPI)'''), is a [[Non-profit organization]] with the purpose of promoting and securing the [[Jew|Jewish people]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish People Policy Institute|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/jewish_people_policy_institute|publisher=NY-The Jewish Week|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is a professional policy planning apparatus and a strategic thought process for the Jewish people in the most fundamental subjects concerning the Jewish people. The institute is served by most prominent public figures from the government, academia, the private sector in Israel and Jewish communities around the world, who constitute the [[think tank]] of this body.

The JPPI's viewpoint is all-Jewish and long term, and a cornerstone of its work is the premise that Israel is the core of the Jewish people. Its think tank systematically and professionally examines the challenges, threats and opportunities that the Jewish people are coping with, and develops principles for policies and strategic alternatives. In addition, it may recommend on immediate steps needed to be taken in order to secure the continuity and prosperity of the Jewish people.

JPPI was founded in 2002 by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], and is run as an independent body. It is headed by a board of directors that is now chaired by [[Dennis Ross]], the special advisor for the Persian Gulf Southwest Asia in U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration. Its current President is Avinoam Bar-Yosef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conference to discuss Jewish world's budget|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4296104,00.html|accessdate=16 November 2013|newspaper=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic Scotland. Retrieved 13 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This article lists the '''oldest extant freestanding buildings in Scotland'''. In order to qualify for the list a [[structure]] must:
* be a recognisable building (defined as any human-made structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous [[occupancy]]);
*incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} in height and/or be a [[listed building]].

This consciously excludes ruins of limited height, roads and statues. Bridges may be included if they otherwise fulfill the above criteria. Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by [[radiocarbon dating]] and should be considered approximate.

The main chronological list includes buildings that date from no later than 1199 AD. Although the oldest building on the list is the Neolithic farmhouse at [[Knap of Howar]], the earliest period is dominated by [[chambered cairn]]s, numerous examples of which can be found from the 4th millennium BC through to the early Bronze Age.

Estimates of the number of [[broch]] sites throughout the country, which date from the [[Iron Age]], range from just over 100 to over 500.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small percentage are sufficiently well preserved for them to be included here and some of those that could be remain undated.

As there are  relatively few structures from the latter half of the first millennium AD and a significant number from the 12th century, the latter group is  placed in a sub-list. There are larger numbers of extant qualifying structures from 1200 onwards and separate lists for 13th-century castles and religious buildings are provided. As the oldest buildings in many of the [[council area]]s in the more urbanised [[Central Belt]] date from after the 14th century a separate list showing oldest buildings by council area is provided.
[[File:Skara Brae - geograph.org.uk - 888338.jpg|thumb|Dwelling at [[Skara Brae]], part of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
There is also a supplementary list of qualifying structures for which no confirmed date of construction is available and a short listing of substantial prehistoric structures that are not buildings as defined above.

'''MASCOS''', or the ARC Centre of Excellence for [[Mathematics]] and [[Statistics]] of [[Complex Systems]], was established in 2003 with about $11 million in funding over five years from the  [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) to research Complex/Intelligent Systems. 

== Overview ==
MASCOS’s overarching strategic vision is to be one of the world’s leading centres in the mathematical and statistical analysis, design and optimisation of complex systems, and to apply that research for scientific, economic, social and environmental benefit. The Centre operates from five nodes: [[The University of Melbourne]], [[Australian National University]], [[The University of New South Wales]], [[The University of Queensland]] and [[La Trobe University]]. In 2008, it will have 14 Chief Investigators and 1 Professorial Fellow, all of whom have international reputations for their research in mathematics and statistics.

[[Complex systems]] play a key role in a vast range of societal activities– climate, the internet, traffic control, power distribution, agriculture, defence, manufacturing, engineering, water management, finance and many more. In any system, be it physical, biological or social, collective phenomena occur as the number of components increase. 

Analysing the behaviour of any individual component gives no indication as to how the system as a whole behaves, but understanding entire systems can lead to the prediction and subsequently the control and optimisation of their behaviour. 

The mathematical and statistical techniques developed to understand these entire complex systems form the basis for the research being undertaken by MASCOS, which in turn has many potential applications to real world problems. 

The underlying problem in complex systems science that guides MASCOS' work may be summed up thus: how do local or small-scale phenomena interact to create complex or chaotic behaviour?

== Applications ==
MASCOS' work revolves around three flagship applications, all of which highlight real-world complex systems, which can be better understood and therefore, potentially, better controlled through the research conducted by MASCOS. These three flagship applications are:

# Accurate assessment of financial risk: The sub-prime loan disaster of 2007 is a reminder of the complex networks that link banks. Even in stable times, the daily fluctuation of interest rates makes the calculation of risk a major challenge.
# Security of large engineering grids: Power grids, the internet and traffic flow can all be described as networks that are prone to dynamic collapse. This, for example, occurred in North American and European power grids in 2003. Security measures are important tools for maintaining system integrity in the face of such critical behaviour.
# Control of emerging pests, diseases and pathogens: Australia has a persistent problem with the introduction of foreign pests or diseases- such as equine flu in 2007.

These, and other applications (e.g. climate modelling) draw upon a variety of mathematical and statistical techniques, which MASCOS has now grouped into four themes. At the mathematical level, each of the themes constitutes a concerted push towards the central problem of the relationship between local behaviour and global complexity. 

Within each theme, clearly identifiable goals are set and a range of projects is tackled. These projects are stepping stones in the solution of the flagship applications described above. Regular workshops are held around each theme, at which agreed projects are developed and reviewed. 

Each theme has a leader and a deputy leader. Almost all members of MASCOS are associated with at least two themes, a situation reflective of their interconnectedness and which maximise cross-pollination of ideas. These are the four themes: 

# Risk Modelling: All complex systems are subject to operational risks, especially those associated with extreme behaviour.
# Critical Phenomena: Critical phenomena are universal features of emergent behaviour in complex systems.
# Dynamical Systems: The complex systems in the flagship applications all involve non-linear dynamical systems.
# Complex Networks: Complexity typically arises from interconnectedness in large-scale systems which can be modelled as a network.

== Focus, scale and interconnectedess ==
The focus, scale and interconnectedness of MASCOS is greatly enhanced by the above-mentioned flagship applications, which are all dependent on the work done in some or all of the four themes. For example, the first application Accurate assessment of financial risk, is being tackled by [[Peter Hall (mathematical statistician)|Hall]]'s classifiers, Borovkov's stochastic analysis, [[Ian Sloan|Sloan]]'s Quasi-Monte Carlo tools and Thompson/Guttmann's Info-Gap work, all supported by the dynamical systems theme members’ studies of stability, and Brent's algorithmic expertise.

The second application, Security of large engineering grids, is being addressed by Hill’s stability theory, Froyland’s and Taylor’s optimisation algorithms, and Pollett’s and Taylor’s network
techniques.

The third application, Control of emerging pests, diseases and pathogens, is being tackled by techniques from risk modelling, such as Pollett’s calibration of stochastic models from discrete-sampled infection data, from Taylor’s work in complex networks in which he develops models that account for spatial structure in the spread of infection, by Brak’s work in critical phenomena – determining conditions for endemicity and other stable regimes, and Froyland’s work in dynamical systems in which he assesses the relative stability of endemic and non-endemic states.

The generic nature of mathematics, where the same methodology can have a wide range of applications, leads to research activities with potentially very broad scale. The above research
program harnesses and exploits this scale particularly well.

== MASCOS legacy ==
An important contribution is the legacy or longer term benefit that the MASCOS research program will provide, and it is here that the mathematical sciences, by their nature, provide broad benefits, even in areas beyond the current scope of MASCOS.

There is a body of common core mathematics and statistics which can be identified as important to solving problems in complex systems such as our flagship applications. The themes are underpinned by a unified mathematical framework which consists of dynamical systems, graph theory, network science, stability theory and stochastic processes that can be used to tackle a wide variety of complex systems problems. The themes are strongly inter-linked. Critical phenomena is being applied to networks to understand transitions, risk analysis is used in studying the reliability of large networks, and dynamical systems theory is used to determine the stability of networks. 

''These links create mathematical synergies toward development of a powerful approach to managing complexity that will be of lasting value to Australian science.''

Thus, for instance, while working on risk classifiers for the first flagship application, Hall's work on classifiers will include improved ways of discriminating among different forms of cancer using genetic data, better ways of detecting covert signals, making the best decisions for important meteorological problems, and so forth. 

The second flagship application will lead to broader ideas on coordinated control that have applications in numerous areas of importance to Australia’s infrastructure. 

Similarly, work done in the third will be of lasting benefit to Australia, not only for its immediate relevance to biosecurity issues, but also because the techniques developed can be applied directly wherever interaction and flow are salient features of the system in question: for example, the control of populations of native fauna, the management of fish stocks, and the propagation of memes in social networks.

More examples of the potential inherent in this approach exist. For instance, improved [[data assimilation]] techniques will be essential for extending existing techniques in meteorology to apply to the wider range of scale and complexity that will arise when developing a new generation of climate models for the Southern Hemisphere. 

The development of the critical dimension of dynamical systems is finding application in coding theory, and Quispel’s bifurcation analysis of the model of the human cortex has already received favourable reactions from both mathematically  and medically oriented research teams. Clinical implementation of control strategies suggested by this work is still at a preliminary stage, but earlier work by collaborator David Liley, based on the same model equations, has already led to a patented EEG reading device.

Additionally, complex networks research undertaken by MASCOS for Patrick Corporation is already being incorporated into Patrick’s software to significantly increase the efficiency of new
container handling infrastructure at Port Botany, Sydney. This research will have a lasting impact on Australia's international trade at Port Botany with the potential to be adopted at other major ports around Australia. While this initial research is embedded in Patrick’s systems, MASCOS continues to hold discussions with Patrick for a second major stage of research. 

Thus, MASCOS’s legacy extends substantially beyond the solution of the flagship applications and key problems– important though they are.

'''Mathematical psychology''' is an approach to [[psychology|psychological]] research that is based on [[mathematical modeling]] of perceptual, thought, cognitive and motor processes, and on the establishment of law-like rules that relate quantifiable stimulus characteristics with quantifiable behavior. The mathematical approach is used with the goal of deriving hypotheses that are more exact and thus yield stricter empirical validations. Quantifiable behavior is in practice often constituted by task performance.

As quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor, the [[measurement|theory of measurement]] is a central topic in mathematical psychology.
Mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to [[psychometrics]]. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to [[experimental psychology]]/[[cognitive psychology]]/[[psychonomics]]. &lt;!--The models used are mostly probabilistic but there are also discrete ones.--&gt; Like [[computational neuroscience]] and [[econometrics]], mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way. Central themes from cognitive psychology; limited vs. unlimited processing capacity, serial vs. parallel processing, etc., and their implications, are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology. &lt;!--There are many subfields including [[measurement|theory of measurement]].--&gt;

Mathematical psychologists are active in many fields of psychology, especially in [[psychophysics]], [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensation]] and [[perception]], [[problem solving]], [[decision theory|decision-making]], [[learning]], [[memory]], and [[psycholinguistics|language]], collectively known as [[cognitive psychology]], and the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|quantitative analysis of behavior]] but also, e.g., in [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[music psychology|psychology of music]].
&lt;!--Some mathematical models include but are not limited to the [[matching law]], [[detection_theory|signal detection theory]], [[game theory]], [[behavioral economics]]]], etc.--&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ernst Heinrich Weber.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Ernst Heinrich Weber]].]]
[[Image:Gustav Fechner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Gustav Fechner]].]]

Mathematical modeling has a long history in psychology starting in the 19th century with [[Ernst Heinrich Weber|Ernst Weber]] (1795–1878) and [[Gustav Fechner]] (1801–1887) being among the first to apply successful mathematical technique of [[functional equations]] from physics to psychological processes. They thereby established the fields of [[experimental psychology]] in general, and that of [[psychophysics]] in particular.

Researchers in [[astronomy]] in the 19th century were mapping distances between stars by denoting the exact time of a star's passing of a cross-hair on a telescope. For lack of the automatic registration instruments of the modern era, these time measurements relied entirely on human response speed. It had been noted that there were small systematic differences in the times measured by different astronomers, and these were first systematically studied by German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]] (1782–1846). Bessel constructed ''personal equations'' from measurements of basic response speed that would cancel out individual differences from the astronomical calculations. Independently, physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] measured reaction times to determine nerve conduction speed.

These two lines of work came together in the research of Dutch physiologist [[Franciscus Donders|F. C. Donders]] and his student [[Johan Jacob de Jaager|J. J. de Jaager]], who recognized the potential of reaction times for more or less objectively quantifying the amount of time elementary mental operations required. Donders envisioned the employment of his ''[[mental chronometry]]'' to scientifically infer the elements of complex cognitive activity by measurement of ''simple reaction time''&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leahey |first=T. H. |year=1987 |title=A History of Psychology |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=Second |isbn=0-13-391764-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following is a set of loose points not well integrated with the main text. It interrupts the flow of the article and doesn't seem to serve a point -----------
In the United States, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] conducted experiments on reaction times, weight discrimination, and color perception. In the famous experiment on weight discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Peirce (with the assistance of [[Robert Jastrow]]) introduced important statistical methods, including
*[[Randomized controlled trial|the randomized assignment of treatments to subjects]], [[blind experiment]]s, and [[logistic regression]].

Peirce's experiment on reaction times invented a [[repeated measures design]] and used [[smoothing]]. Peirce's psycho-physical experiments are discussed in the statistical histories by [[Stephen Stigler#Books|Stephen Stigler]].
----------------------------------------------&gt;
The first psychological laboratory was established in Germany by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who amply used Donders' ideas. However, findings that came from the laboratory were hard to replicate and this was soon attributed to the method of [[introspection]] that Wundt introduced. Some of the problems resulted from individual differences in response speed found by astronomers. Although Wundt did not seem to take interest in these individual variations and kept his focus on the study of the ''general human mind'', Wundt's U.S. student [[James McKeen Cattell]] was fascinated by these differences and started to work on them during his stay in England.

The failure of Wundt's method of introspection led to the rise of different schools of thought. Wundt's laboratory was directed towards conscious human experience, in line with the work of Fechner and Weber on the intensity of stimuli. In the United Kingdom, under the influence of the anthropometric developments led by [[Francis Galton]], interest focussed on individual differences between humans on psychological variables, in line with the work of Bessel. Cattell soon adopted the methods of Galton and helped laying the foundation of [[psychometrics]].

===20th century===

In the United States, [[behaviorism]] arose in opposition to [[introspectionism]] and associated reaction-time research, and turned the focus of psychological research entirely to learning theory.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt; In Europe introspection survived in [[Gestalt psychology]]. Behaviorism dominated American psychology until the end of the [[Second World War]], and largely refrained from inference on mental processes. Formal theories were mostly absent (except for [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]).

During the war, developments in [[engineering]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[computability theory]], [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], and the military need to understand [[human factors|human performance and limitations]], brought together experimental psychologists, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and economists. Out of this mix of different disciplines mathematical psychology arose. Especially the developments in [[signal processing]], [[information theory]], [[linear systems]] and [[filter theory]], [[game theory]], [[stochastic processes]] and [[mathematical logic]] gained a large influence on psychological thinking.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002" /&gt;

Two seminal papers on learning theory in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' helped to establish the field in a world that was still dominated by behaviorists: A paper by Bush and Mosteller instigated the linear operator approach to learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The 1950s saw a surge in mathematical theories of psychological processes, including [[Luce's choice axiom|Luce's theory of choice]], Tanner and Swets' introduction of [[signal detection theory]] for human stimulus detection, and Miller's approach to information processing.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Batchelder |first=W.

E. |editor-last=Kazdin |title=Encyclopedia of Psychology |location=Washington/NY |publisher=APA/Oxford University Press |isbn=1-55798-654-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1950s, the number of mathematical psychologists had increased from a handful by more than a tenfold, not counting psychometricians. Most of these were concentrated at the Indiana University, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Stanford.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2002"&gt;[http://www.mathpsych.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27 Estes, W. K. (2002). History of the Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were regularly invited by the U.S. Social Science Research Counsel to teach in summer workshops in mathematics for social scientists at Stanford University, promoting collaboration.

To better define the field of mathematical psychology, the mathematical models of the 1950s were brought together in sequence of volumes edited by Luce, Bush, and Galanter: Two readings&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). ''Readings in mathematical psychology. Volumes I &amp; II.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and three handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). Handbook of mathematical psychology. Volumes I-III''. New York: Wiley. [https://www.archive.org/download/handbookofmathem017893mbp/handbookofmathem017893mbp.pdf  Volume II from Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of volumes turned out to be helpful in the development of the field. In the summer of 1963 the need was felt for a journal for theoretical and mathematical studies in all areas in psychology, excluding work that was mainly factor analytical. An initiative led by [[Richard C. Atkinson|R. C. Atkinson]], [[R. R. Bush]], [[W. K. Estes]], [[R. Duncan Luce|R. D. Luce]], and [[P. Suppes]] resulted in the appearance of the first issue of the [[Journal of Mathematical Psychology]] in January, 1964.&lt;ref name="Estes2002"/&gt;

Under the influence of developments in computer science, logic, and language theory, in the 1960s modeling gravitated towards computational mechanisms and devices. Examples of the latter constitute so called [[cognitive architectures]] (e.g., [[Production system (computer science)|production rule system]]s, [[ACT-R]]) as well as [[connectionist]] systems or [[neural networks]].

Important mathematical expressions for relations between physical characteristics of stimuli and subjective perception are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] (which is now sometimes called Weber-Fechner Law), [[Ekman's Law]], [[Stevens' Power Law]], Thurstone's [[Law of Comparative Judgment]], the [[Signal detection theory|Theory of Signal Detection]] (borrowed from radar engineering), the [[Matching Law]], and [[Rescorla-Wagner model|Rescorla-Wagner rule]] for classical conditioning. While the first three laws are all [[deterministic]] in nature, later established relations are more fundamentally [[stochastic]]. This has been a general theme in the evolution in mathematical modeling of psychological processes: from deterministic relations as found in classical physics to inherently stochastic models.

'''National Laboratory of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics''' ('''KL FAMO''') is the national inter-university research center with the headquarters at Institute of Physics of [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], [[Poland]]. Established in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forumakad.pl/archiwum/2002/07-08/ARTYKULY/02-kronika.htm|title = Formu Akademickie|accessdate= 2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the Laboratory is focused on [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics|atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO)]].&lt;ref name=strona_KLFAMO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famo.fizyka.umk.pl|title=Official webpage of KL FAMO|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

=== Ultra-cold matter ===
The activities of the ultra-cold matter group at KL FAMO are focused on [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein condensation]] (the first BEC in Poland was created in 2007 in KL FAMO
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wojciech Gawlik|title=Pierwszy polski kondensat Bosego-Einsteina|trans-title= The first Bose-Einstein condensate in Poland|journal=Foton|date=2007|accessdate=2016-04-08|issn=1234-4729|issue=98/2007|url=http://www.foton.if.uj.edu.pl/documents/12579485/11daaeaa-3ffb-4b61-89f0-1ec224ff1f41}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and on ultra-cold molecules' photoassociation [[spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="strona_KLFAMO" /&gt;

=== Optical atomic clocks ===   
Two [[strontium]] [[Atomic clock#Optical clocks|optical lattice atomic clocks]] are operating at the KL FL FAMO. Together with  [[frequency comb|optical frequency combs]] they form the Polish Optical Atomic Clock (POZA). The POZA is a state-of-the-art optical atomic clock, collaboratively developed by scientists from the [[University of Warsaw]], [[Jagiellonian University]], and [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń|Nicolaus Copernicus University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fuw.edu.pl/tl_files/press/docs/2015/FUW150225a%20-%20Optical%20atomic%20clock.pdf|title=Top-precision optical atomic clock starts ticking|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optical clocks' experimental group at KL FAMO is conducting research on, i.a., [[black-body radiation]] influence on the [[Atomic electron transition|atomic transitions]], shapes of molecules potentials by photoassociation [[spectroscopy]],&lt;ref name="strona_KLFAMO" /&gt; and on [[Dark matter#Topological defects|topological defects dark matter]]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last= Wcisło |first= Piotr |display-authors=etal||eprint=1605.05763 |title= Searching for topological defect dark matter with optical atomic clocks|date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum engineering ===
The studies of the [[quantum optics]] group are focused on experimental verifications of fundamental [[quantum mechanics]] predictions. In particular, the Laboratory is  especially interested in [[quantum metrology]], [[quantum information]] and [[quantum key distribution]] studies.  Modern quantum information experiments are performed using single optical [[photon]]s as the so-called [[qubit]]s.&lt;ref name="strona_KLFAMO" /&gt;

=== High resolution spectroscopy ===
High resolution spectroscopic studies in the Laboratory are based on the [[cavity ring-down spectroscopy|Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)]]. In CRDS experiments the resonant [[optical cavity]] filled with a light-absorbing gas is pumped up by the [[laser]]. The [[absorption spectroscopy|absorption spectrum]] can be determined by measuring the wavelength dependence of time constant of the decay of the light transmitted through one of the optical cavity mirrors. The CRDS is an excellent tool for  trace gas detection and precise measurements of weak absorption spectra. The laboratory provides accurate data for spectroscopic databases such as [[HITRAN]].&lt;ref name="strona_KLFAMO" /&gt;

=== Ion traps ===
The research of the ion group is focused on trapped molecular ions in the [[ion trap]]s – relatively new branch of physics. Recent works in this field focus on the production, detection and cooling of the molecular ions. The trapped molecules are subject to spectroscopic investigations and as products/substrates for cold chemistry of single molecules.&lt;ref name="strona_KLFAMO" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)''' refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.

NAMA was first used in the [[Bali Action Plan]] as part of the [[Bali Road Map]] agreed at the [[Bali Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali]] in December 2007, and also formed part of the [[Copenhagen Accord]] issued following the [[COP 15|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]] (COP 15) in December 2009.

==History of the use of NAMA in international agreements==

===Bali Action Plan (December 2007)===
The [[Bali Action Plan]] is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component. 
The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/climatechange/docs/UNDP_BAP_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by all developed countries, and;''
* ''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.''.

===Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009)===
The [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2es.org/copenhagen-accord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions … consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development … Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. '''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported '''nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.''

==What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action?==
* Different countries, different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities 
* Developing countries will effectively implement national action depending on the effective implementation of the commitments by developed countries in providing financial resources and transfer of technology. 
* The priorities of developing countries are economic and social development and poverty eradication.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/39/16/40633672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
India has argued that NAMA means ''voluntary reductions'' by developing countries that ''require to be supported and enabled'' by technology transfer from developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce [[illegal logging]], and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

==Implementation of NAMA==
In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter C. and Schibli R., If you want a Nama tomorrow, you need a POA today (March 2011), Trading Carbon, Reuters. Available at: http://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/110300_Namas_TradingCarbon_SPcs-rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of NAMA submissions==
As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/namainfo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2012 "Submission of more information by developing country Parties, subject to availability, relating to nationally appropriate mitigation actions, including underlying assumptions and methodologies, sectors and gases covered, global warming potential values used, support needs for implementation of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and estimated mitigation outcomes. Submissions from Parties." FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/MISC.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2011 "Compilation of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions to be implemented by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention." FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of NAMA's Submitted==

A list of NAMAs is available at http://www.nama-database.org/.

[[Clean Production Agreement]], [[Chile]], 2012.

==Criticism of NAMA==
Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from [[carbon pricing]] and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stoft, Steven E., Beyond Kyoto: Flexible Carbon Pricing for Global Cooperation (October 23, 2009).

[[File:M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center Nathan M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.jpg|thumb|275px|Entrance to the Yeh Student Center]]

The '''Nathan M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory''', or '''Newmark Lab''', located at 205 N. Mathews Avenue in [[Urbana, Illinois]] on the campus of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], houses the university's [[Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering]].  The Lab was built in 1967, and has been modified and updated a number of times since then.&lt;ref name=fac&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/portalresearch_facilities "Civil and Environmental Engineering: Research Facilities"]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was named after professor and department head [[Nathan M. Newmark]] after his death.

The building consists of classrooms and offices surrounding a large open area called the crane bay for large scale experiments,&lt;ref name=fac /&gt; including those of the Newmark Structural Engineering Lab (NSEL). Newmark also contains a professional machine shop where students and faculty can have material fabricated by the staffed professionals, and a student instrumentation workshop where students and faculty can fabricate materials themselves.

In 2011, the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center was added to the building.

== Crane bay ==

The crane bay is a large open area in the center of Newmark Laboratory with a three story height. It is where much of the department's structural research and testing is done. There are large doors on both the north and south sides of this area, where trucks and equipment can move through.  The crane bay gets its name from two large yellow hydraulic cranes on rails above the room, which move heavy equipment around. The crane bay houses many structural analysis equipment, including a concrete cylinder crusher for strength tests and beam deflection measurement devices. There is also a {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} L-shaped concrete reaction wall with hydraulic actuators, which was added in 2004. The crane bay's large open size is also sometimes used for departmental events such as Engineering Open House and the department's annual career fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Grzegorz Banas | title=NSEL Policy 2009 | url=http://nsel.cee.illinois.edu/website2008upgrade/safety.policy/nsel.policy.2009.02.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center ==

In 2011, an addition called the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center, designed by Teng &amp; Associates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecandsinc.com/newmarkyeh.html "M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center Addition - Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory - University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Campus"]&lt;/ref&gt; was completed at the cost of $7 million, adding {{convert|20500|sqft|m2}}  of classrooms, student study space and meeting rooms. The Yeh Center was funded entirely with private gifts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/yehcenter "Civil and Environmental Engineering: M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leader&gt;[http://issuu.com/ceeatillinois/docs/history_2_pdf_issuu "Leadership and Legacy"]&lt;/ref&gt; in particular a $4 million gift from M. T. Geoffrey Yeh, a 1953 graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering. Yeh is chairman of [[Hsin Chong]] International Holdings, Ltd., a large construction company in China.

"'''On Denoting'''" is an essay by [[Bertrand Russell]]. It was published in the philosophy journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1905. In it, Russell introduces and advocates his theory of denoting phrases, according to which definite descriptions and other "denoting phrases ... never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning."&lt;ref name="Russell 480"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | authorlink = Bertrand Russell   | coauthors =   | title = On Denoting  | journal = Mind  | volume = 14  | issue = 56  | pages = 479-493  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = October 1905  | jstor = 2248381 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory later became the basis for Russell's [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] with regard to proper names, and his view that proper names are "disguised" or "abbreviated" [[definite descriptions]].

In the 1920s, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] referred to the essay as "that paradigm of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "denoting phrase"==

===Russell's concept of a denoting phrase===

For Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]], whose [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas [[Frege]] held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its [[Sense and reference|''Sinn'' and ''Bedeutung'']]), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (''Sinn'') and replaces it with the idea of a [[propositional function]] (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: "a man, any man, every man, the present [[King of France]]... the centre of mass of the [[Solar System]], ...." So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article "the" at the beginning), which "does not denote anything" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not [[referring expression]]s but rather, to borrow a term later coined by [[Keith Donnellan]], they have "attributive" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are "general" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.

===Reference to something that does not exist===

However, at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where "a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')" and cases where they may denote "one definite object (such as '[[:Edward VII|the present King of England]]')". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may "refer" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognised the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential) that Donnellan later proposed.

=== Epistemology ===

In any case, after clarifying the sense of the term "denoting phrase" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: [[knowledge by description]] and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|knowledge by (direct) acquaintance]]. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.

==The theory of descriptions==

=== Mathematical description ===
Russell starts out by defining the "fundamental" notion of a ''[[propositional function]]''. This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of ''unsaturated concepts''. Hence, "''C''(''x'') stands for a proposition in which ''x'' is a constituent and where ''x'', the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined." The notions of ''everything'', ''nothing'' and ''something'' ("the most primitive of denoting phrases") can then be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; C(E) \leftrightarrow \forall x C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(N) \leftrightarrow \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(S) \leftrightarrow \lnot \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' stands for everything, ''N'' stands for nothing and ''S'' stands for something. ''All'' is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasises that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] as he proceeds to illustrate.

===Illustration===

The phrase "the [[:Charles I of England|father]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (F) was executed (E)" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( \left( F \left( x \right) \land  \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow x=y \right) \right) \land E \left( x \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed.

So, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( F \left( x \right) \land \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow  x=y \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions in a primary occurrence is false.  (If the mother of Charles II was ‘unfaithful’ the statement may be false.)  In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. "The present king of [[Samothrace]] is
a great writer") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not.

==Meinong==
He then criticises [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]'s theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore, there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as "the present King of France" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to ''non-existent objects''. Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the "round square" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as "impossible" objects that have no being.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Reinhardt. "Alexius Meinong". ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (ed.) Ted Honderich. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolving the problem of negative existentials==
One of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative [[Existential clause|existentials]]. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls ''primary'' and ''secondary'' occurrences of denoting phrases.

===Statements about concepts where the object does not exist===

Since definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of "the present King of France is not bald." Here the two possible readings are:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land \lnot B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lnot \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

In the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. "Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence." Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies ''only'' the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence.

===Ambiguity===

Russell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: "[[:George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] wondered whether [[Walter Scott|Scott]] is the author of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''." In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the ''de dicto'' / ''de re'' ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence "George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir Walter" can be interpreted as:

:''George IV wondered whether the x that... is identical to the y that....''

where "..." stands for some definite description such as "the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe" and ....stands for something like "the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess". In the ''de re'' case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead:

:''the x that... is such that King George wondered whether x is identical to the y that....''

===Fictional names===

Finally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as "[[Apollo]]" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above.

==Criticisms==
In his essay, "On Referring", [[P. F. Strawson]] criticised Russell's characterisation of statements where the object does not exist, such as "the present King of France", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to "give general directions for its use."&lt;ref name="Strawson 327"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F.

Strawson also argued that we often need to know the use of a word to understand its meaning, such as in statements of the form, "The table is covered with books." In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table is what is being referenced.&lt;ref name="Strawson 332"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P.

In the 19th century the placing of spectacular antiquities in the new museums brought unusual interest from the general public to Oriental studies.]]
'''Oriental studies''' is the academic field of study that embraces [[Near East]]ern and [[Far East]]ern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]]. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of [[Islamic studies]], while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called [[Sinology]]. The study of [[East Asia]] in general, especially in the United States, is often called [[East Asian studies]], while the study of [[Israel]] and [[Jews]] are called [[Israel studies]] and [[Jewish studies]] respectively, although they are often considered the same field.

European study of the region formerly known as "the [[Orient]]" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by [[Imperialism|imperialist]] attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the [[history of ideas]] in the West, called "[[Orientalism]]". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.

== History of Oriental studies ==

=== Pre-Islam ===
The original distinction between the "West" and the "East" was crystallized in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, when [[Athens|Athenian]] historians made a distinction between their "[[Athenian democracy]]" and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the ''Oriens-'' and ''Occidens''-divided administration of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Roman Empire]] at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their [[Ancient Persia]]n neighbours (and usually enemies), but very [[Sino-Roman relations|imprecise]] knowledge of most of the world further East, including the "[[Seres]]" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct [[Roman trade with India]] (unlike with China) in the Imperial period.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:HaytonRemittingHisReportToThePope.JPG|left|thumb|[[Hayton of Corycus]] remitting his report on the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], to [[Pope Clement V]], in 1307.]]
The [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]] and [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European [[Christendom]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (which stretched from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s were considered the "alien" enemies of Christendom. Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalized travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]] and legends of [[Prester John]], although the equally famous, and much longer, account by [[Marco Polo]] was a good deal more accurate.

Scholarly work was initially very largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] and languages like [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works on [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]]. This effort, also called the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]" witnessed a particular [[Latin translations of the 12th century|growth in translations]] of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like [[Constantine the African]], who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and [[Herman of Carinthia]], one of the translators of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete|earliest translation]] of the Qur'an into [[Latin]] was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. [[Gerard of Cremona]] and others based themselves in [[Al-Andaluz]] to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. Later, with the Christian [[Reconquista]] in full progress, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the [[Council of Vienne]] (1312).&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures'' 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universität Berlin. Institut für Judaistik - 2006 "According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311–1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

There was [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|vague but increasing]] knowledge of the complex civilizations in [[China]] and [[History of India|India]], from which luxury goods (notably [[cotton]] and [[silk]] textiles as well as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]) were imported. Although the [[Crusades]] produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the [[Mongol Empire]] had strategic implications for both the [[Crusader kingdoms]] and Europe itself, and led to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|extended diplomatic contacts]]. From the [[Age of Exploration]], European interest in [[Cartography of Asia|mapping Asia]], and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities.

=== Renaissance to 1800 ===

University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Polyglot Bible]], containing the complete existing texts in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], in addition to Greek and Latin. At [[Cambridge University]] there has been a [[Regius Professor of Hebrew (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Hebrew]] since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair in Arabic]] was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included [[Edmund Castell]], who published his ''Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum'' in 1669, whilst some scholars like [[Edward Pococke]] had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The [[University of Salamanca]] had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] initiated a training programme for "Les Jeunes de langues", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like [[François Pétis de la Croix]], who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the [[Far East]] was pioneered by missionaries, especially [[Matteo Ricci]] and others in the [[Jesuit China missions]], and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies.

During the 18th century Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travellers, like [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]], and their languages, remained limited. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''Lettres Persanes'' or [[Voltaire]]'s ironic promotion of [[Zoroastrianism]]; others, like [[Edward Gibbon]], praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], the high social status of scholarship in [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] China.
The [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"]] (English: University of Naples "L'Orientale"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.

The end of the century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the [[archaeology]] of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. [[Egyptology]] led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Kolkata Asiatic Society2.jpg|thumb|The old building of the [[Asiatic Society]] in [[Calcutta]], founded by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] in 1784]]
With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of [[Indo-European languages|close relations between Indian and European languages]], by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as [[James Mill]], denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. [[Karl Marx]], himself of [[Jewish]] origin, characterized the [[Asiatic mode of production]] as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. [[Oriental despotism]] was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of [[progress (history)|progress]] of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria  and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by [[Victor Place]] excavated the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. &lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition resulted in a pioneering publication entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by [[Victor Place]] and [[Felix Thomas]] and published in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  New national museums provided a setting for important archaeological finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight as never before.

The first serious European studies of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were by the scholars [[Eugene Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. In that time, the academic [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|study of Islam]] also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did [[Racism|racist]] attitudes and stereotypes of "inscrutable", "wily" Orientals. This frequently extended to local [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities, who were also of [[Genetic studies on Jews|Oriental origin]] and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,&lt;ref&gt;J. Go, "'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire" in ''Qualitative Sociology' '''27'''.1 (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; to which the new [[biology|biological sciences]] tended to contribute until the middle of the following century.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Experts inspecting the [[Rosetta Stone]] during the [[Second International Congress of Orientalists]] in London, 1874]]
The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of [[post-colonial studies]] and [[Subaltern Studies]]. The influence of [[Orientalism]] (in the sense used by Edward Said in his [[Orientalism (book)|book of the same name]]) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to "a lacuna" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), ''The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam'' (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The post–Cold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the [[Arab world]] and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post–Cold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the [[Cold War]] was the popularization of the '[[clash of civilizations]]' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article entitled "The Roots of Muslim Rage", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post–Cold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] in his 1993 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', called "The Clash of Civilizations?".&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Orientalism}}
The term ''Orientalism'' has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by [[Edward Said]] in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental enlightenment the encounter between Asian and Western thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For example Thomas R. Trautmann in ''Aryans and British India'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-520-20546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From "Oriental Studies" to "Asian Studies" ==

{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Like the term ''[[Orient]]'', ''Orientalism'' derives from the Latin word ''oriens'' (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). "Orient" is the opposite of ''[[Western world|Occident]]'', a term for the Western world. In terms of the [[Old World]], [[Europe]] was considered the [[Western world|Occident]] (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the [[Orient]] (the east).  Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the [[Middle East]]' was then considered 'the Orient'.  However, use of the various terms and senses derived from "Orient" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West.

In most [[North America]]n universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by [[Asian Studies]] localised to specific regions, such as [[Middle East]]ern or Near Eastern Studies, [[South Asia]]n studies, and [[East Asia]]n Studies.  This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple [[civilization]]s. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship.  In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods.

In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Cambridge University]] was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its [[Oriental Institute, Oxford|Faculty for Oriental Studies]], as do [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pontifical Oriental Institute|Rome]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies|London]] (covering African studies also), and [[Oriental Institute (disambiguation)|other universities]].

Various explanations for the change to "Asian studies" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like [[Asian American]]s). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term "Oriental" has been heightened in a more [[politically correct]] atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at [[Princeton University]] was renamed a decade ''before'' Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/near_eastern_studies.html Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By some, the term "Oriental" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. [[Area studies]] that incorporate not only philological pursuits but [[identity politics]] may also account for the hesitation to use the term "Oriental".

Supporters of "Oriental Studies" counter that the term "[[Asia#Etymology|Asian]]" is just as encompassing as "Oriental," and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for "East" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable ''opinions'' about the East with the concept of "the East" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

CIBSE National Lighting Conference, Cambridge, 8–11 April 1990, 182-189, Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, however, the [[interior design]] community has begun to reconsider this practice. Over illumination encompasses two separate concerns:
* Unnecessary electric lighting is expensive and energy-intensive.  Lighting accounts for approximately 9% of residential electricity use {{as of|2001|lc=y}}&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;Department of Energy, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/enduse2001/enduse2001.html&lt;/ref&gt; and about 40% of commercial electricity use.&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;Lighting in Commercial Buildings, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/cbecs2003/lighting/lighting1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excessive levels of artificial light may adversely affect health. These detrimental effects may depend on the spectrum as well as the overall brightness level of light.

Over illumination can be reduced by installing [[occupancy sensor]]s, using [[daylight|natural sunlight]] whenever possible, turning off lights when leaving a room, or changing the type of lightbulb. Over illumination does not refer to [[Photokeratitis|snowblindness]], where high exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] causes physical damage to the eye.  Too little light, the opposite of over illumination, is associated with [[seasonal affective disorder]].

==Causes==

Over illumination can be caused by several factors:
* Illuminating an unoccupied area
* Using electrical lights instead of natural light
* Providing lighting for an occupied area, but with too much intensity
* Installing too few electrical controls. This results in an area that must either be over illuminated or not illuminated at all

In addition, there are ancillary reasons why over illumination might be decided to be necessary. For example, retail stores with large windows will sometimes stay illuminated overnight as a method of crime prevention.

While some aspects of illumination are readily controllable, such as turning off lights when exiting a room, others are determined by the architecture and construction of the building.  For example, [[skylight (window)|skylight]]s decrease the amount of artificial lighting that is required during the daytime, but most buildings do not have them installed.  In addition, too few light switches can also cause issues.  If an office building with large windows only has one switch per floor, then electric lights will illuminate the perimeter areas (with abundant natural light) to same level as the interior zones (which receive less sunlight).

==Health effects==
[[File:FluorescentT8razorback.jpg|thumb|Common T8 [[fluorescent lighting]] fixture frequently used in office environments]]

Over illumination has been linked to various negative health effects.  While some effects might happen because the [[Compact fluorescent lamp#Comparison with incandescent lamps|color spectrum of fluorescent lighting]] is significantly different from [[Color temperature#Categorizing different lighting|sunlight]],&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lumina"&gt;Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., ''Survey of 156 California commercial buildings energy use'', August, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;Peter Boyce and Boyce R Boyce, ''Human Factors in Lighting'', 2nd ed., Taylor &amp; Francis, London (2003) {{ISBN|0-7484-0950-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{Request quotation|date=August 2016}} other symptoms might be caused by light that is simply too intense. In particular, over illumination has been linked to [[headache]]s, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[stress (medicine)|medically defined stress]], anxiety, and decreases in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] function.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;''Cambridge Handbook of Psychology, Health and Medicine'', edited by Andrew Baum, Robert West, John Weinman, Stanton Newman, Chris McManus, Cambridge University Press (1997) {{ISBN|0-521-43686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burks"&gt;Susan L. Burks, ''Managing your Migraine'', Humana Press, New Jersey (1994) {{ISBN|0-89603-277-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pijnenburg"&gt;L. Pijnenburg, M. Camps and G. Jongmans-Liedekerken, ''Looking closer at assimilation lighting'', Venlo, GGD, Noord-Limburg (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knez"&gt;Igor Knez, ''Effects of colour of light on nonvisual psychological processes'', Journal of Environmental Psychology, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2001, Pages 201-208&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies attribute migraine headaches to overly intense light,&lt;ref name="Burks" /&gt; while others linked it with certain spectral distributions.&lt;ref name="Boyce" /&gt;  In one survey bright light was the number two trigger (affecting 47% of respondents) for causing a migraine episode.&lt;ref name="Burks" /&gt; 

Fatigue is another common complaint from individuals exposed to over illumination, especially with fluorescent media.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; 

Likewise, over illumination can also cause stress and anxiety.  In fact, natural light was preferred over purely artificial light by office workers from both eastern and western cultures.&lt;ref name="Nagy"&gt;E. Nagy, Sachiko Yasunaga and Satoshi Kose, ''Japanese office employees' psychological reactions to their underground and above-ground offices'', Building Research Institute, Ministry of Construction, 1 Tatehara, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken 305, Japan, Revised 13 April 1995. Available online 20 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, over illumination can cause [[stress (medicine)|medical stress]]&lt;ref name="Pijnenburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basso"&gt;M.R Basso Jr., ''Neurobiological relationships between ambient lighting and the startle response to acoustic stress in humans'', Int J Neurosci. 2001;110(3-4):147-57,&lt;/ref&gt; and even aggravate other psychological disorders like [[agoraphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hazell and A.J. Wilkins, ''A contribution of fluorescent lighting to agoraphobia'', . Psychol Med. 1990 Aug;20(3):591-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The replacement of natural light with artificial light also decreases task performance under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Knez" /&gt;

===Circulatory and circadian rhythm effects===
[[Hypertension]] effects of over illumination can lead to aggravation of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[erectile dysfunction]], which impacts are outcomes of  long term cumulative exposure and associated systematic increases in blood pressure. The mechanism of this effect seems to be stress by related [[upregulation]] of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] production akin to the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref&gt;Narisada Kohei and Duco Schreude, ''Light Pollution Handbook'', Springer, Netherlands (2004) {{ISBN|1-4020-2665-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biological Effects of Power Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields'', Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, University Press of the Pacific (2002) {{ISBN|0-89875-974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Circadian rhythm]] disruption is primarily caused by the wrong timing of light in reference to the circadian phase. It can also be affected by too much light, too little light, or incorrect spectral composition of light. This effect is driven by stimulus (or lack of stimulus) to photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. The "time of day", the circadian phase, is signalled to the [[pineal gland]], the body’s [[photometer]], by the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]]. Bright light in the evening or in the early morning shifts the phase of the production of [[melatonin]] (see [[phase response curve]]). An out-of-sync melatonin rhythm can worsen [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and increase [[Redox|oxidized]] [[lipid]]s in the [[Ischemia|ischemic]] [[heart]]. Melatonin also reduces [[superoxide]] production and myeloperoxide (an [[enzyme]] in neutrophils which produces [[hypochlorous acid]]) during ischemia-reperfusion.&lt;ref name="Boyce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiter"&gt;R.J. Reiter, Cardiovascular Research; 58:10-19 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy and economic considerations==
Using too much lighting will lead to higher electricity consumption, and therefore higher electricity costs, for the owner of the building.  The solution to this issue is multi-faceted because there are several causes of too much light.

===High-intensity light===
First, over illumination occurs when the intensity of lighting is too high for a given activity.  For example, an office building might have many sets of fluorescent lights to keep the area illuminated after sundown.  During the daytime, however, large windows might allow for abundant amounts of natural sunlight to enter the office.  Therefore, keeping all of the fluorescent lights illuminated during the daytime might cause unnecessary costs and energy consumption.

===Leaving lights turned on===
Likewise, not switching off the lights when exiting a room will also cause higher energy consumption.  Some people avoid frequently turning off CFL bulbs because they think that doing so will cause them to burn out prematurely.  While this is true to a certain extent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/29267-5.4.3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511132153/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/29267-5.4.3.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Department of Energy recommends that 15 minutes is an appropriate time frame.  If someone plans to leave the room for less than 15 minutes, then the light should be left on.  If the room will be unoccupied for more than 15 minutes, then the light should be switched off.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/when-turn-your-lights&lt;/ref&gt;  Another concern is that turning on a fluorescent bulb consumes large amounts of energy.  While fluorescent bulbs do need more energy turn on, the amount of electricity consumed is equal to only a few seconds of normal operation.&lt;ref name="energy.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Consumers Guide to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy'', [[U.S. Department of Energy]], Washington DC (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/science/04qna.html?ex=1346558400&amp;en=fb20488ad5a46f3c&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|date=2007-09-04|accessdate=2008-05-06|first=C. Claiborne|last=Ray|title=Lights Off!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes people do not turn off lights for other reasons, such as an office worker whose company actually pays for the electricity.  In these cases [[building automation]] provides more control.  These solutions provide centralized control of all lighting within a home or commercial building, allowing easy implementation of scheduling, [[occupancy sensor|occupancy control]], daylight harvesting and more. Many systems also support [[demand response]] and will automatically dim or turn off lights to take advantage of DR incentives and cost savings. Many newer control systems are using wireless mesh open standards (such as [[ZigBee]]), which provides benefits including easier installation (no need to run control wires) and interoperability with other standards-based building control systems (e.g. security).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting control saves money and makes sense|url=http://www.daintree.net/downloads/whitepapers/smart-lighting.pdf|publisher=[[Daintree Networks]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural design and the type of light bulbs===
Architectural design can also provide ways of reducing energy usage.  There are technological aspects of [[window]] design where window angles can be calculated to minimize interior glare and reduce interior over illumination, while at the same time reducing solar heat loading and subsequent demand for air conditioning as energy conservation techniques. For the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]] the angled window projections effectively provide permanent sunscreens, obviating interior blinds or shades.

Ideally, the design of a building would create multiple switches for the overhead lighting.  Adjusting these settings would allow the optimal light intensity to be delivered,&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; the most common version of this control being the "three-level switch", also called A/B switching.  Much of the benefit of the excess illumination reduction comes from a better ratio of natural light to fluorescent light that can result from any of the above changes.  Research has been conducted showing worker productivity gains in settings where each worker selects his or her own lighting level.&lt;ref&gt;H. Juslen, M. Wouters M and A. Tenner, ''The influence of controllable task-lighting on productivity: a field study in a factory'',  Appl Ergon., Mar 7;  2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the type of light bulbs that are installed has a significant effect on energy consumption.  The efficiency of light sources vary greatly.  Fluorescent lights produce several times as much light, for given power input, as incandescent lights do, and LEDs are continuing to improve beyond that.  Shades vary in their absorption. Light colored ceilings, walls and other surfaces increase ambient light by reflecting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''Papyrology''' is the study of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc., as preserved in [[manuscript]]s written on [[papyrus]], the most common form of writing material in the ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Papyrology includes both the translation and interpretation of ancient documents in a variety of languages and the care and preservation of rare papyrus originals.

Papyrology as a systematic discipline dates from the 1890s, when large caches of well-preserved papyri were discovered by [[archaeologist]]s in several locations in [[Egypt]], such as Arsinoe ([[Faiyum]]) and [[Oxyrhynchus]]. Leading centres of papyrology include [[Oxford University]], [[Heidelberg University]], [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Leiden University]], the [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], 
[[University of California, Berkeley]] and the Istituto Papirologico "G. Vitelli" connected to the [[University of Florence]]. Founders of papyrology were the Viennese orientalist {{ill|Joseph von Karabacek|de}} (Arabic papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ''The Dictionary of Art'', Grove's Dictionaries, 1996, p.548&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Schubart]] (Greek papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;''The Harvard Theological Review'', Harvard Divinity School 1941, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrian antiquarian {{ill|Theodor Graf|de}} who acquired more than 100,000 Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Persian papyri in Egypt, which were bought by the Austrian [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer]],&lt;ref&gt;Glenn W. Most, ''Disciplining Classics: Altertumswissenschaft als Beruf'', 2002, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigol Tsereteli|G. F. Tsereteli]] who published papyri of Russian and Georgian collections,&lt;ref&gt;Bobodzhan Gafurovich Gafurov, Yuri Vladimirovich Gankovskiĭ, ''Fifty Years of Soviet Oriental Studies'', Institut narodov Azii (Akademii︠a︡ nauk SSSR) 1968, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic George Kenyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Leo Deuel, ''Testaments of Time: The Search for Lost Manuscripts and Records'', Knopf, 1965, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Wilcken]], [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]], [[Arthur Surridge Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies, ''The Journal of Jewish Studies'', Jewish Chronicle Publications, 1974, p.420&lt;/ref&gt; and other distinguished scientists. 

The collection of pagan, Christian and Arabic [[papyrus|papyri]] in Vienna called the {{ill|Rainer papyri|de|Papyrussammlung und Papyrusmuseum Wien}} represents the first large discovery of manuscripts on papyrus found in the [[Fayum]] in [[Egypt]]. Around 1880, a carpet trader in Cairo acquired on behalf of Karabacek over 10,000 papyri and some texts written on linen. Of those Fayum papyri, over 3000 are written in Arabic. The papyri originated from Kôm Fâris ([[Crocodilopolis|Krokodílon Pólis]]) and Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah ([[Herakleopolis Magna]]), the textile pages from Kôm al-‘Azâma. They were exported to Vienna in 1882, and presented in a public exhibition the following year that caused a sensation. Later the papyri were bought by the Grand Duke Rainer and presented to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Anker, ''Libri: International Library Review'', International Federation of Library Associations  1951, p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

The first papyrus was published in the West by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] in [[Velletri]] in 1778, with the title "Charta papyracea Graece scripta Museums Borgiani Velitris" famous by the name of Charta Borgiana.

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press}} was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement.&lt;!-- Please do NOT add "mathematician". Despite the famous theorem that now bears his name, scholars dispute whether the historical Pythagoras was involved in mathematics at all. Please read the rest of the lead and the "Attributed discoveries" section for further information. Thank you. --&gt; His political and religious teachings were well known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included [[vegetarianism]], although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. Following Croton's decisive victory over [[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"){{efn|[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].

Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

==Biographical sources==

No authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=796}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}} and almost nothing is known for certain about his life.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=3–5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–23}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest sources on Pythagoras's life are brief, ambiguous, and often [[satire|satirical]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}} The earliest source on Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by [[Xenophanes of Colophon]], who had been one of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=62}} In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a [[dog]] that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} [[Alcmaeon of Croton]], a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}} incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} The poet [[Heraclitus of Ephesus]], who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras's lifetime,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} remarking that "Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself—much learning, artful knavery."{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}

The Greek poets [[Ion of Chios]] ({{circa|480|421&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) and [[Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa|493|432&amp;nbsp;BC}}) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=14–15}} The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] ({{circa|484|420&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}),{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} who describes him as "not the most insignificant" of Greek sages&lt;ref&gt;4. 95. &lt;/ref&gt; and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain [[immortality]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=88}} The [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] [[rhetoric]]ian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} [[Aristotle]] wrote a treatise ''On the Pythagoreans'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;He alludes to it himself, ''Met.'' i. 5. p. 986. 12, ed. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it may be preserved in the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]''. Aristotle's disciples [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] also wrote on the same subject.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the [[Ancient Greece#Roman Greece|Roman period]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} by which point, according to the German classicist [[Walter Burkert]], "the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone."{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} Three [[Biography#Historical biography|lives]] of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The two later lives were written by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} and were partially intended as polemics against the [[rise of Christianity]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Pyth.'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]], and for its riotous festival culture.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=45–47}} It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian [[natural philosophy]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}} He was a contemporary of the philosophers [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and the historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], all of whom lived in [[Miletus]], across the sea from Samos.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}

===Alleged travels===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of [[Archaic Greece]] was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=22–23}} By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writer [[Antiphon (writer)|Antiphon]], who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work ''On Men of Outstanding Merit'', used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] from the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]] himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at [[Thebes, Egypt|Diospolis]] (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.&lt;ref name="Porphyry6"&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} The [[Middle Platonist]] biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|46|120&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}) writes in his treatise ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]'' that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (meanwhile [[Solon]] received lectures from a [[Sonchis of Sais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|150|215&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=no}}), "Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as [[Plato]] of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]."{{sfn|Press|2003|page=83}} Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. Antiphon. ap. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28–9; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 27; Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the [[Magi]] in [[Persia]] or even from [[Zoroaster]] himself.&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited [[Crete]], where he went to the [[Mount Ida|Cave of Ida]] with [[Epimenides]].&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"/&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns are reputed to have taught Pythagoras [[arithmetic]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns to have taught him astronomy.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the [[Jews]] as well.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Contradicting all these reports, the novelist [[Antonius Diogenes]], writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by [[Dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The third-century AD [[Sophist]] [[Philostratus]] claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sages in [[India]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}}

Ancient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Some identify [[:fr:Hermodamas|Hermodamas of Samos]] as a possible tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2, Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of rival of the poet [[Homer]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Others credit [[Bias of Priene]], Thales,&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 9"&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Anaximander]] (a pupil of Thales).&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Other traditions claim the mythic bard [[Orpheus]] as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The Neoplatonists wrote of a "sacred discourse" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the [[Doric Greek]] dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at [[Leibethra]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and from other religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, [[Pherecydes of Syros]] is mentioned most often.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus and others in Diogenes Laërtius, i. 118, 119; Cicero, ''de Div.'' i. 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Apollonius Paradoxographus]], a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgic]] ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher [[Nicomachus]], tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of [[Delos]], Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Duris of Samos|Duris]], the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met [[Thales of Miletus]], who would have been around fifty-four years older than him.

Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of [[Samos]], is situated in the Northeast [[Aegean Sea]] not far from [[Miletus]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}} Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from [[Aristoxenus]] (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his [[moral]] doctrines from the [[Pythia|Delphic priestess]] [[Themistoclea]].&lt;ref name="Laertiusviii18"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''], viii. 1, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""Ellen Waithe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x7ngECDpxmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Mary Ellen Waithe, ''Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.–500 A.D.'', p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Malone |first=John C. |title=Psychology: Pythagoras to present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Qa6cMQj8AC&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01296-6 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry agrees with this assertion,&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41.&lt;/ref&gt; but calls the priestess Aristoclea (''Aristokleia'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Ménage]]: ''The history of women philosophers''.

Porphyry repeats an account from [[Antiphon]], who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the "semicircle".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=22}} His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the [[Tyrant#Historical forms|tyranny]] of [[Polycrates]] in Samos,&lt;ref name=Boyer /&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 28; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today's [[Crotone]], in [[Calabria]]) in what was then [[Magna Graecia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia J. de Vogel: ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism.''

Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras "did not indulge in the pleasures of love"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=58}} and that he cautioned others to only have sex "whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]], a lady of [[Crete]] and the daughter of Pythenax{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and had several children with her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named [[Telauges]] and [[Arignote]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and a daughter named Myia,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} who "took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions none of these children{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

The wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and quotes several opinions attributed to her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} These writings are now known to be [[pseudepigraphica]]l.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

===Death===
Pythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of [[Sybaris]] in 510 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a [[Greek democracy|democratic constitution]], which the Pythagoreans rejected.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} The supporters of democracy, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} The building was apparently set on fire,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} and many of the assembled members perished;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} only the younger and more active members managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255–259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54–57; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of [[Locris]], where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} They reached the city of [[Metapontum]], where they took shelter in the temple of the [[Muses]] and died there of starvation after forty days without food.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=278}} Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.{{sfn|Simoons|1998|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}

Although the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=5–6}} it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=9–11}} Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been ''[[metempsychosis]]'',{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=300–301}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} the belief that all [[soul]]s are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}} This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36, comp. Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 3; Herodotus, ii. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}} Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=25}}

[[Empedocles]] alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=12}} Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from [[Heraclides Ponticus]] that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–167}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 26; Pausanias, ii. 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 5; Horace, ''Od.'' i. 28,1. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these lives was as [[Aethalides]] the son of [[Hermes]], who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–165}} Next, he was incarnated as [[Euphorbus]], a minor hero from the [[Trojan War]] briefly mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]''.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=165–166}} He then became the philosopher [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]],{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from [[Delos]].{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} One of his past lives, as reported by [[Dicaearchus]], was as a beautiful courtesan.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}

===Mysticism===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]",{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven [[Muse]]s were actually the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] singing together.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} In his philosophical dialogue [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], [[Aristotle]] has his literary double say:

{{quote|When Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, "to observe the heavens," and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web|author1=D.

Pythagoras was said to have practiced [[divination]] and [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Divin.'' i. 3, 46; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the visits to various places in Greece—[[Delos]], [[Sparta]], [[Phlius]], [[Crete]], etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} They believed that all things were made of numbers.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=265}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=27}} The number one (the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all things{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} and the number two (the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]) represented matter.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} The number three was an "ideal number" because it had a beginning, middle, and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] were [[masculine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=467}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=170}}

Ten was regarded as the "perfect number"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was "so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it]," that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|page=66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=28}}

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus of Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87–88}} In his landmark study ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, [[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}} but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=465}}

Scholars Press.; D. J. O'Meara, (1989), ''Pythagoras Revived. Mathematics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity'', pages 35–40.

Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the ''mathematikoi'' ("learners") and the ''akousmatikoi'' ("listeners").{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The ''akousmatikoi'' are traditionally identified by scholars as "old believers" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} whereas the ''mathematikoi'' are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8, 91, 141&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long [[spondee]]s and the boys' "raging willfulness" was quelled.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of [[physical exercise]];{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} therapeutic [[dance|dancing]], daily morning walks along [[scenic route]]s, and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=33–34}}

Pythagorean teachings were known as "symbols" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;Scholion ad Aristophanes, ''Nub.'' 611; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} during which they were required to remain silent.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} seventeen of whom are women.{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of [[Neopythagoreanism]].{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|pages=xvi–xvii}}

Pythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=10}}&lt;ref&gt;comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 32; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=30–31}} In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} which he publicly exhibited at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} and showed to [[Abaris the Hyperborean]] as proof of his identity as the "Hyperborean Apollo".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=47}} He is also said to have borne a golden [[wreath]] atop his head{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} and to have worn [[trousers]] after the fashion of the [[Thrace|Thracians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable [[self-control]];{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} he was always cheerful,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} but "abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}} and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=60–61}} Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} and leading them to trust him with their wives.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}}

Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–22}} classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including [[Pythagorean theorem|his famous theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12; Plutarch, ''Non posse suav. vivi sec.

According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of [[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] centuries before Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, 462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=6–7}} but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}} Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he&amp;mdash;or his students&amp;mdash;may have constructed the first [[Mathematical proof|proof]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=33}} Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.{{efn|There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone.

According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} However, this legend is demonstrably false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}}

===In astronomy===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary [[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and the first to identify the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning star]] and the [[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306–308}} and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a [[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.{{sfn|Dicks|1970|page=68}}

==Later influence in antiquity==
===On Greek philosophy===
[[File:Timaeus trans calcidius med manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Old manuscript with writing in a thin, fancy script with colored geometric diagrams illustrating the text.|Medieval manuscript of [[Calcidius]]'s Latin translation of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', which is one of the Platonic dialogues with the most overt Pythagorean influences{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}]]
{{See also|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, [[Phlius]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] during the early fourth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=48–49}} Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher [[Archytas]] was highly influential on the politics of the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in Magna Graecia.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–43}} He was a close friend of Plato{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–40}} and he is quoted in Plato's ''Republic''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=40, 44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' VII, 530d&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=1}} Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have a strong "Pythagorean coloring",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}} are extremely Pythagorean in character.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}

According to [[R. M. Hare]], Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' may be partially based on the "tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers" established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world"{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} and it is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphicism|Orphism]].{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} The historian of philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33–37}} He concludes that "I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought."{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123–124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] philosophers such as [[Eudorus of Alexandria|Eudorus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] hailed the rise of a "new" Pythagoreanism in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=124}} At around the same time, [[Neopythagoreanism]] became prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} The first-century AD philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the soul as a "kind of mathematical harmony."{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist [[Nicomachus]] likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} [[Numenius of Apamea]] interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=126–127}}

===On art and architecture===
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting showing a massive room with a high, domed ceiling. A hole is open at the top of the dome. Columns and statues line the walls.|[[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], depicted in this eighteenth-century painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], was built according to Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}}]]

Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}} Early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.{{efn|"For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form"{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}}}} The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}), which was mathematically calculated.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=62}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}} [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that "all things are numbers".{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}}

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–65}} Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]) behind aesthetic perfection.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor [[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}{{efn|"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290–294.}} In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. [[Rhys Carpenter]] states that the ratio 2:1 was "the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]],{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=154}} a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=154–156}} The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=157–158}} and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=158}} The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=158–159}} It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=159}} The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=159–161}} with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} The apse depicts a scene of the poetess [[Sappho]] leaping off the [[Lefkada|Leucadian cliffs]], clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=162–164}}

The emperor [[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}} The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical [[dome]], and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=167–168}} The single [[oculus]] at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=168}} The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=169–170}} The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}}

===In early Christianity===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–65}} [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340 AD), bishop of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], praises Pythagoras in his ''Against Hierokles'' for his rule of silence, his frugality, his "extraordinary" morality, and his wise teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to [[Moses]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In one of his letter, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] ({{circa}} 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–58}} [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=58–59}} In ''[[On the Trinity]]'', Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a ''philosophos'' or "lover of wisdom" rather than a "sage".{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}} In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}}

==After antiquity==
===In the Middle Ages===
[[File:Pythagore-chartres.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval carving of a man with long hair and a long beard hunched over a musical instrument he is working on|Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the [[archivolts]] over the right door of the west portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes Laërtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from Greek into Latin{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's ''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as well,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work ''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in [[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}}

===On modern science===
In his preface to his book ''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161–171}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, "warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}

[[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} he attributed the discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} [[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be "a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that "In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36–37}} By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are "following the pure Pythagorean tradition."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}

===On vegetarianism===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Painting showing Pythagoras on the far left quizzically stroking his beard as he gazes upon a massive pile of fruits and vegetables.

Next to him, a fleshy, nude woman with blonde hair plucks fruits from it. Slightly behind her, two other women, one partially clothed and the other nude but obscured by the tree branch, are also plucking fruits. At the far right end of the painting, two nude, faun-like men with beards and pointed ears hurl more fruits upon the pile.|''Pythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism'' (1618-1630) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a belief that vegetarianism was healthful and nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]

A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} It was through [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise "Of Cruelty" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable "Pythagoras and the Countryman" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as "Pythagoreans".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled "To the Pythagorean Diet"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}

===On Western esotericism===
Early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish [[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the [[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a "religious magi"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} [[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean symbolism,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637),{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284–288}} and, in his book ''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287–288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286–287}} [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the "heirs of Pythagoras".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}

[[Dante Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56–57, he declares: "five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity."{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90–91}} The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction {{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of [[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of [[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91–92}} and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}

The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's ''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}

'''Retrofitting''' refers to the addition of new technology or features to older systems.
* [[power plant]] retrofit, improving power plant efficiency / increasing output / reducing emissions
* [[home energy retrofit]], the improving of existing buildings with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] equipment
* [[seismic retrofit]], the process of strengthening older buildings in order to make them earthquake resistant
* Naval vessels often undergo retrofitting in dry dock to incorporate new technologies, change their operational designation, or compensate for perceived weaknesses in their design or gun plan.

==Benefits of a retrofit==
* Saving on [[capital expenditure]] while benefiting from new technologies
* Optimization of existing plant components
* Adaptation of the plant for new or changed products
* Increase in piece number and cycle time
* Guaranteed spare parts availability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma-automation.com/Retrofitting.1520.0.html?&amp;L=1, article on retrofit, retrieved on 4 June 2010]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.controleng.com/single-article/controls-retrofit-boosts-printing-production-for-packaging-manufacturer/dc88d98fd08caf326e1458d61f97b548.html|title=Controls retrofit boosts printing production for packaging manufacturer {{!}} Control Engineering|website=www.controleng.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
Principally retrofitting describes the measures taken in the manufacturing industry to allow new or updated parts to be fitted to old or outdated assemblies (like blades to wind turbines).

The production of retrofit parts is necessary in manufacture when the design of a large assembly is changed or revised. If, after the changes have been implemented, a customer (with an old version of the product) wishes to purchase a replacement part then retrofit parts and assembling techniques will have to be used so that the revised parts will fit suitably onto the older assembly.

Retrofitting is an important process used for valves and actuators to ensure optimal operation of an industrial plant. One example is retrofitting a 3-way valve into a 2-way valve, which results in closing one of the three openings to continue using the valve for certain industrial systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.baelzna.com/blog/chilled-water-system-valves|title=3-Way Valves Vs. 2-Way Valves in a Chilled Water Systems|last=America|first=Baelz North|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrofitting can improve a machine or system’s overall functionality by using advanced and updated equipment and technology—such as integrating Human Machine Interfaces into older factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/design-engineering-blogs/guest-blog-retrofit-your-way-to-industry-4-0/147234/|title=Retrofit your way to Industry 4.0|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eurekamagazine.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is [[custom car|car customizing]], where older vehicles are fitted with new technologies: [[power window]]s, [[cruise control]], [[remote keyless system]]s, electric [[fuel pump]]s, etc.

==Environmental management==
The term is also used in the field of [[environmental engineering]], particularly to describe [[construction]] or renovation projects on previously built sites, to improve [[water quality]] in nearby [[stream]]s, [[river]]s or [[lake]]s. The concept has also been applied to changing the output mix of [[energy]] from [[power plant]]s to [[cogeneration]] in [[urban area]]s with a potential for [[district heating]].

Sites with extensive [[impervious surface]]s (such as parking lots and rooftops) can generate high levels of [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] during rainstorms, and this can damage nearby water bodies.  These problems can often be addressed by installing new stormwater management features on the site, a process that practitioners refer to as stormwater retrofitting. Stormwater management practices used in retrofit projects include [[rain garden]]s, [[permeable paving]] and [[green roof]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD (2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080626221608/http://www.cwp.org/Store/usrm.htm#3#3 "Urban Stormwater Retrofit Practices."]&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[stream restoration]].)''

==Naval vessels==
Many naval vessels have undergone retrofitting and refitting, sometimes entire classes at once. For instance, the [[New Threat Upgrade]] program of the US Navy saw many vessels retrofitted for improved anti-air capability. Naval vessels are often retrofit for one of three reasons: to incorporate new technology, to compensate for performance gaps or weaknesses in design, or to change the ship's [[Hull classification symbol#The modern hull classification system|classification]].

Militaries of the world are often ardent adopters of the latest technology, and many technological advances have been spurred by warfare, especially in fields such as radar and radio communications. Because of this, and the significant investment that a ship hull represents, it is common for retrofitting to be performed whenever new systems are developed. This may be as small as replacing one type of radio with another, or replacing out-dated cryptography equipment with more secure methods of communication, or as major as replacing entire guns and turrets, adding armor plate, or new propulsion systems.

Other ships are retrofit to compensate for weaknesses perceived in their operational capabilities. This was the secondary purpose of the US Navy's New Threat Upgrade program, for instance. Major changes in doctrine or the art of warfare also necessitate changes, such as the anti-aircraft upgrades performed on many World War Two-era vessels as air power became a dominant part of naval strategy and tactics.

Additionally, because of the investment a hull represents, few navies scrap front-line warships. Many times smaller ships are retrofitted for patrol, coast guard, or specialized roles when they are no longer fit for duty as part of a warfleet. The Japanese [[Momi-class destroyer|Momi class]] from the interwar period, for example, was converted from destroyers to patrol boats in 1939, as they were no longer capable enough to serve in the role of destroyer. Other times classes are retrofit because they are no longer needed in warfare, due to changes in tactics. For instance, the [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS Langley]] was an aircraft carrier converted from a collier (coal carrying ship for supply coal-fired steam ships with fuel) of the Jupiter-class.

Because of the heavy use of retrofitting and refitting fictional navies also include the concept. As an example, in the Star Trek [[MMORPG]] Star Trek Online players can purchase retrofitted ships of famous Star Trek ship classes such as those manned by the protagonists of the Star Trek TV series. This is done to allow players to pilot iconic ships of the series from old series of the show that wouldn't naturally be latest-and-greatest ships due to their obsolescence or size but are retrofit to be suitable for a maximum-level player-character admiral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22879">The '''simulation hypothesis''' or '''simulation theory''' proposes that all of reality, including the earth and the universe, is in fact an artificial simulation, most likely a [[computer simulation]]. Some versions rely on the development of a [[simulated reality]], a proposed technology that would seem realistic enough to convince its inhabitants the simulation was real. The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many [[science fiction]] stories and films.

==Origins==
There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion. This [[skeptical hypothesis]] can be traced back to antiquity; for example, to the "[[Zhuangzi (book)#.22The Butterfly Dream.22|Butterfly Dream]]" of [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You're living in a computer simulation, and math proves it|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5799396/youre-living-in-a-computer-simulation-and-math-proves-it|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Indian philosophy of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]].

==Simulation hypothesis==
[[File:Nick Bostrom.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Bostrom]] in 2014]]

{{quote|Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don't think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears.|Nick Bostrom, ''Are you living in a computer simulation?'', 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243–255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ancestor simulation===
In 2003, philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] proposed a [[trilemma]] that he called "the simulation argument". Despite the name, Bostrom's "simulation argument" does not directly argue that we live in a simulation; instead, Bostrom's trilemma argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true:
# "The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one"
The trilemma points out that a technologically mature "posthuman" civilization would have enormous computing power; if even a tiny percentage of them were to run "ancestor simulations" (that is, "high-fidelity" simulations of ancestral life that would be indistinguishable from reality to the simulated ancestor), the total number of simulated ancestors, or "Sims", in the universe (or [[multiverse]], if it exists) would greatly exceed the total number of actual ancestors.

Bostrom goes on to use a type of [[Anthropic principle#Character of anthropic reasoning|anthropic reasoning]] to claim that, ''if'' the third proposition is the one of those three that is true, and almost all people with our kind of experiences live in simulations, ''then'' we are almost certainly living in a simulation.

Bostrom claims his argument goes beyond the classical ancient "[[skeptical hypothesis]]", claiming that "...we have interesting empirical reasons to believe that a certain [[logical disjunction|disjunctive]] claim about the world is true", the third of the three disjunctive propositions being that we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Thus, Bostrom, and writers in agreement with Bostrom such as [[David Chalmers]], argue there might be empirical reasons for the "simulation hypothesis", and that therefore the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis but rather a "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical hypothesis]]". Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument for which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: "If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility #''n'' that obtains.' But different people pick a different ''n''. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true."

As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that "Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."&lt;!-- The entire trilemma section up to here is cited to: --&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2003"&gt;Bostrom, N., 2003, [http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html Are You Living in a Simulation?], Philosophical Quarterly (2003), Vol. 53, No. 211, pp. 243-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/faq.html The Simulation Argument Website] FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/matrix.html The Simulation Argument: Why the Probability that You Are Living in a Matrix is Quite High], [[Nick Bostrom]], Professor of Philosophy at [[Oxford University]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "M@M"&gt;Davis J. Chalmers [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics] Dept of Philosophy, U. o Arizona; paper written for the philosophy section of ''[[The Matrix]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Bostrom's anthropic reasoning===
{{further|Anthropic principle}}

Bostrom argues that, ''if'' "the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one", ''then'' it follows that we probably live in a simulation. Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps "Sims" do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Weatherson]]. "Are you a sim?" The Philosophical Quarterly 53.212 (2003): 425-431.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting "neural ancestor simulations" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's "ancestor simulations", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Dainton, Barry. "On singularities and simulations." Journal of Consciousness Studies 19.1 (2012): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars categorically reject or are uninterested in anthropic reasoning, dismissing it as "merely philosophical", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

Some critics reject the [[block universe]] view of time that Bostrom implicitly accepts and propose that we could be in the first generation, such that all the simulated people that will one day be created [[philosophical presentism|don't yet exist]].&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

The cosmologist [[Sean M. Carroll]] argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if a civilization is capable of performing simulations, then it will likely perform many simulations, which implies that we are most likely at the lowest level of simulation (from which point one's impression will be that it is impossible to perform a simulation), which contradicts the arguer's assumption that advanced civilizations can most likely perform simulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/08/22/maybe-we-do-not-live-in-a-simulation-the-resolution-conundrum/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis===
[[File:Molecular Dynamics Simulation of DPPC Lipid Bilayer.webm|thumb|Simulation down to molecular level of very small sample of matter]]
Some scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that we live in a simulation) is false. Physicist [[Paul Davies]] deploys Bostrom's trilemma as part of one possible argument against a near-infinite [[multiverse]]. This argument runs as follows: if there were a near-infinite multiverse, there would be posthuman civilizations running ancestor simulations, and therefore we would come to the untenable and scientifically self-defeating conclusion that we live in a simulation; therefore, by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', existing multiverse theories are likely false. (Unlike Bostrom and Chalmers, Davies (among others) considers the simulation hypothesis to be self-defeating.)&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul, Charles William. "Multiverse cosmological models." [[Modern Physics Letters A]] 19.10 (2004): 727-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some point out that there is currently no proof of technology which would facilitate the existence of sufficiently high-fidelity ancestor simulation. Additionally, there is no proof that it is physically possible or feasible for a posthuman civilization to create such a simulation, and therefore for the present, the first proposition must be true.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;
Additionally there are proofs of [[limits of computation]].

==Consequences of living in a simulation==
Economist [[Robin Hanson]] argues a self-interested high-fidelity Sim should strive to be entertaining and praiseworthy in order to avoid being turned off or being shunted into a non-conscious low-fidelity part of the simulation. Hanson additionally speculates that someone who is aware that he might be a Sim might care less about others and live more for today: "your motivation to save for retirement, or to help the poor in Ethiopia, might be muted by realizing that in your simulation, you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hanson]]. "How to live in a simulation." Journal of Evolution and Technology 7.1 (2001).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis physically==
A long-shot method to test one type of simulation hypothesis was proposed in 2012 in a joint paper by physicists Silas R. Beane from the University of Bonn (now at the University of Washington, Seattle), and Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage from the University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Beane |first= Silas |author2= Zohreh Davoudi |author3= Martin J. Savage |date= 9 November 2012 |title= Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation |arxiv= 1210.1847 |laysource= The Physics arXiv Blog  |laysummary= http://www.technologyreview.com/view/429561/the-measurement-that-would-reveal-the-universe-as-a-computer-simulation/ |laydate= October 10, 2012 |quote= ABSTRACT Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10^&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.|ref= |separator= |postscript= |bibcode= 2014EPJA...50..148B|doi= 10.1140/epja/i2014-14148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption of finite computational resources, the simulation of the universe would be performed by dividing the continuum space-time into a discrete set of points. In analogy with the mini-simulations that [[lattice gauge theory|lattice-gauge theorists]] run today to build up [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] from the underlying theory of [[strong interaction]]s (known as [[Quantum chromodynamics]]), several observational consequences of a grid-like space-time have been studied in their work. Among proposed signatures is an [[anisotropy]] in the distribution of ultra-high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s, that, if observed, would be consistent with the simulation hypothesis according to these physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation|title=Are We Living in a Computer Simulation?|first=Clara|last=Moskowitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multitude of physical observables must be explored before any such scenario could be accepted or rejected as a theory of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/users/savage/Simulation/Universe/|title=Physics Home|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Campbell et al. propose several experiments aimed at testing the simulation theory in their ''On testing the simulation theory'' paper.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Campbell, Houman Owhadi, Joe Sauvageau, David Watkinson: ''On testing the simulation theory.'' {{arXiv|1703.00058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the experiments, which reached $236,590, more than the required sum of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simulation/do-we-live-in-a-virtual-reality|title=Do we live in a Virtual Reality?|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy==
Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.)  That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching.  Could she not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

===Science fiction themes===
{{main|Simulated reality in fiction|Simulated consciousness (science fiction)}}
Science fiction has highlighted themes such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer gaming for more than fifty years. ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' (1964) by [[Daniel F. Galouye]] (alternative title: ''Counterfeit World'') tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes, in which the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world. The book was made into a German made-for-TV film called  [[World on a Wire|“World on a Wire”]] (1973) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The movie ''[[The Thirteenth Floor]]'' (1999) was also loosely based on this book. "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" is a short story by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' in April 1966, and was the basis for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'' (1990 film)]] and [[Total Recall (2012 film)|''Total Recall'' (2012 film)]]. In ''[[Overdrawn at the Memory Bank]]'', a 1983 television movie, the main character pays to have his mind connected to a simulation. More recently, the same theme was repeated in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicted a world in which artificially intelligent robots enslaved humanity within a simulation set in the contemporary world. The 2012 play ''World of Wires'' was partially inspired by the Bostrom essay on the simulation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/theater/reviews/world-of-wires-at-the-kitchen-review.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Brantley | title=‘World of Wires' at the Kitchen — Review | date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Extremis (Doctor Who)|Extremis]]" (broadcast on 20 May 2017 on [[BBC One]]) of the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', aliens called "The Monks" plan an invasion of Earth by running and studying a holographic simulation of Earth with conscious inhabitants. When the virtual Doctor finds out about the simulation he sends an email about the simulation to his real self so that the real Doctor can save the world. In the first season of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', a science-fiction animated comedy, the episode "[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]" Aliens trap the lead role (Rick) in a simulated reality in order to trick him into revealing his formula for concentrated dark matter. In the game ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', it is revealed that the whole world of the gods Bionis and Mechonis was a simulation run by Alvis, the administrative computer of a phase transition experiment facility (heavily implied to be "Ontos" in Xenoblade Chronicles 2) after Klaus destroyed the universe in a multi-verse experiment. ''[[Simulation Theory (album)|Simulation Theory]]'' is also the name of the eighth album by British alternative band [[Muse (band)|Muse]], released on the 9th of November 2018.

{{Marxian economics |Concepts}}

In the theoretical works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] and subsequent [[Marxist]] writers, '''socialization''' (or the '''socialization of production''') is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor. With the development of capitalism, production becomes centralized in firms and increasingly mechanized in contrast to the pre-capitalist modes of production where the act of production was a largely solitary act performed by individuals. Socialization occurs due to centralization of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in industries where there are [[increasing returns to scale]] and a deepening of the division of labor and the specialization in skills necessary for increasingly complex forms of production and value creation. Progressive socialization of the forces of production under [[capitalism]] eventually comes into conflict with the persistence of relations of production based on private property; this contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation of the social product forms the impetus for the socialization of property relations (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marx's critique of political economy, as capitalism develops a contradiction emerges between the increasingly socialized act of production and the private ownership and appropriation of surplus value. Classical Marxist theory posits that this contradiction will intensify to a point where socialization of surplus value appropriation in the form of [[social ownership]] of the means of production will be necessitated, resulting in a transition from capitalism to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Karl Marx defined socialization as a general phenomenon where the labor process comes to embody the capabilities and constraints developed in society as opposed to private experiences, with objective socialization of the forces of production being the deepening of the social division of labor including specialization of skills and deepening interdependence between industries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Marxist theory ==
Socialization is a process that begins to take place in capitalism as large-scale manufacturing based on a vertical [[division of labour]] displaces "cottage industry" - the small-scale production shops, guilds and family-run businesses that existed in [[Feudalism|feudal economies]]. This process transforms the act of production into an increasingly social and collective process involving planning and greater coordination among producers, but appropriation of the social product in the form of private profit continues to be a private affair by investors and owners of the enterprise. Furthermore, exchange of the commodities produced is the private act of a small group of capitalists or an individual owner. As the process of socialization expands, a contradiction between the socialized nature of production and the individual nature of appropriation of the surplus product arises, coinciding with the obsolescence of the functions performed by the capitalists (the private owners).

The socialization and centralization of industry and capital under capitalism lays the foundations for a socialist economy. Socialism entails ownership of the socialized means of production by the workers engaged in the production either in the form of [[Worker cooperative|worker ownership]] or [[social ownership]] by all of society. The establishment of social ownership over the means of production resolves the contradiction between social production and private exchange/appropriation under capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', by Engels, Friedrich. From "Part III: Historical Materialism": "Capitalist Revolution - transformation of industry, at first be means of simple cooperation and manufacture. Concentration of the means of production, hitherto scattered, into great workshops. As a consequence, their transformation from individual to social means of production — a transformation which does not, on the whole, affect the form of exchange. The old forms of appropriation remain in force. The capitalist appears. In his capacity as owner of the means of production, he also appropriates the products and turns them into commodities. Production has become a social act. Exchange and appropriation continue to be individual acts, the acts of individuals. The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves, and which modern industry brings to light."&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Marx envisioned socialization under socialism as involving an expansion of [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] on the part of workers over their work processes, in contrast to the rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy that characterizes traditional capitalist enterprises. As workers gain more autonomy, they also gain more collective decision-making power and control over their work processes. Socialization of the ownership of the means of production is different from [[nationalization]], which can, but usually does not imply the socialization of the workplace. In a capitalist economy, socialization is limited because the socialized enterprise continues to operate in a commodity economy under the capitalist laws of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialisation&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization therefore takes a different form in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] than in the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19065">'''Spatial citizenship''' describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal [[space|spatial]] decision making through the [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as [[map]]s, [[virtual globe]]s, [[GIS]], and the [[Geoweb]]). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. [[Convention (norm)|social rule]]s, [[spatial planning]]) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.

Spatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are [[Emancipation|emancipatory]] forms of [[citizenship]] and the "reflexive appropriation of space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boscaljon |first=Daniel |date=Spring 2014 |title=The reflexive appropriation of space |journal=Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=15 |pages=3–11 |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1438&amp;context=ijcs |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in citizenship education ==
Spatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: 
* Spatial citizenship respects multiple institutional and locational setups. It is de-linked from traditional national "citizenship" as it is not tied to the nation or local state as predefined spatial entities. Spatial citizenship is based upon the principles of [[human rights]] and [[democracy|democratic negotiation]] to ensure a basis for conciliation and compromise.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It is based on the concept of activist citizenship (in contrast to [[active citizenship]]) formulated by Katharyne Mitchell and Sarah Elwood, who challenge unquestioned social rules that limit participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elwood |first1=Sarah |last2=Mitchell |first2=Katharyne |date=Winter 2013 |title=Another politics is possible: neogeographies, visual spatial tactics, and political formation |journal=Cartographica |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=275–292 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katharyne_Mitchell/publication/265895477_Another_Politics_Is_Possible_Neogeographies_Visual_Spatial_Tactics_and_Political_Formation/links/54c07e490cf28eae4a696b59.pdf |quote=Recognizing neogeography as a site of political formation paves the way toward realizing its broader potential in the development and practice of a critical spatial citizenship. We develop these arguments from a three-year neogeography project conducted with young teens. [...] As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or challenge those put forth by others. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship refers to an open and flexible conception of social institutions. It supplants the notion of belonging to one specific place with the notion of belonging to multiple and fluid [[community|communities]] that may or may not be linked with a particular location on the Earth's surface. Angharad Stephens and Vicki Squire have argued that societal negotiation processes have shifted away from fixed communities due to new information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Angharad Closs |last2=Squire |first2=Vicki |date=June 2012 |title=Politics through a web: citizenship and community unbound |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=551–567 |doi=10.1068/d8511 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13714/1/13714.pdf |quote=What happens to citizenship when the nation and the state are no longer assumed to be the inevitable starting points from which politics is defined? This article considers how a refusal of the nation as political community and a questioning of the state as guarantor of rights and responsibilities reconfigure our understandings of citizenship. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Vânia |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |date=2013 |chapter=Where do critical thinking and spatial citizenship meet? Proposing a framework of intersections |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Car |editor2-first=Adrijana |editor3-last=Strobl |editor3-first=Josef |editor4-last=Griesebner |editor4-first=Gerald |title=Creating the GISociety: conference proceedings |location=Berlin; Offenbach |publisher=Herbert Wichmann Verlag |pages=306–316 |isbn=9783879075324 |oclc=854921245 |chapterurl=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vania_Carlos/publication/270818697_Where_Do_Critical_Thinking_and_Spatial_Citizenship_Meet_Proposing_a_Framework_of_Intersections/links/54b53b5c0cf28ebe92e4dcb0.pdf |quote=Consequently, every citizen can produce own spatial narratives, and can communicate and negotiate them with others in fluent web communities (Closs Stephens &amp; Squire 2012). This links to concepts of emancipated citizenship education (e.g. Bennett, Wells &amp; Rank 2009; Mitchell &amp; Elwood 2012) aimed to challenge existing frameworks of rules, referring to an ideological approach that considers power relations and divergent interests in society as driving forces. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship draws special attention to [[web community|web communities]] and geo-social networks. A spatial citizen is a 'self-actualizing citizen' who, in contrast to the 'dutiful citizen' concept of the past, is able to use [[Web 2.0]] and [[cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications to compare different and potentially contradicting information sources and communicate his/her own alternative ideas via [[collaboration|collaborative]] web tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=W. Lance |last2=Wells |first2=Chris |last3=Rank |first3=Allison |date=April 2009 |title=Young citizens and civic learning: two paradigms of citizenship in the digital age |journal=Citizenship Studies |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=105–120 |doi=10.1080/13621020902731116 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lance_Bennett/publication/248984320_Young_citizens_and_civic_learning_Two_paradigms_of_citizenship_in_the_digital_age/links/53e336b70cf275a5fddab4db.pdf |quote=The preponderance of school-based civic education programs reflects traditional paradigms of dutiful citizenship (DC) oriented to government through parties and voting, with citizens forming attentive publics who follow events in the news.

Their AC learning styles favor interactive, networked activities often communicated through participatory media such as videos shared across online networks. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gryl |first1=Inga |last2=Jekel |first2=Thomas |date=2012 |title=Re-centring geoinformation in secondary education: toward a spatial citizenship approach |journal=Cartographica |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |doi=10.3138/carto.47.1.18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in social geography: appropriation of space ==
Spatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented [[social geography]] and new [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jekel |first1=Thomas |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |last3=Schulze |first3=Uwe |date=2015 |chapter=Education for spatial citizenship |editor1-last=Solari |editor1-first=Osvaldo Muñiz |editor2-last=Demirci |editor2-first=Ali |editor3-last=Schee |editor3-first=Joop |title=Geospatial technologies and geography education in a changing world: geospatial practices and lessons learned |location=Tōkyō; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=35–49 |isbn=9784431555186 |oclc=900306594 |doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55519-3_4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Werlen |first=Benno |date=1993 |title=Society action and space: an alternative human geography |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415069653 |oclc=25372963 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

In these theories, spaces are regarded as being [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and [[discourse]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of [[Power (social and political)|social power relations]], the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the [[deconstruction]] of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a "us". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;Sbicca, Joshua and Perdue, Robert. (2014). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14742837.2013.822782 Protest Through Presence: Spatial Citizenship and Identity Formation in Contestations of Neoliberal Crises] Social Movement Studies, Volume 13, Issue 4 pp. 309-327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial citizenship in the geoinformation society ==
Geographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to [[mobile computing]] in combination with [[Geoweb]] applications. For instance, maps on [[smart phone]]s guide people in their everyday actions, but at the same time limit their opportunities for action by limiting the variety of potential meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Florian |date=2014 |chapter=Everyday geomedia use and the appropriation of space |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Sanchez |editor2-first=Eric |editor3-last=Gryl |editor3-first=Inga |editor4-last=Juneau-Sion |editor4-first=Caroline |editor5-last=Lyon |editor5-first=John |title=Learning and teaching with geomedia |location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=10–28 |isbn=9781443862134 |oclc=885014629 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDxQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of spatial citizenship understand geo-media as instruments of [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] and [[communication]].
* Reflection on geo-media means reflecting on the limitations of previously given meanings by using theories of [[critical cartography]] to ask which aspects of potential relevance for a certain spatial problem or decision making are included and excluded in the given meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harley |first=John Brian |date=Summer 1989 |title=Deconstructing the map |journal=Cartographica |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008?rgn=main;view=fulltext |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, self-reflection requires being aware of one's own, [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[hypothesis]] construction while using geo-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEachren |first1=Alan M. |last2=Buttenfield |first2=Barbara P. |last3=Campbell |first3=James B. |last4=DiBiase |first4=David W. |last5=Monmonier |first5=Mark |date=1992 |chapter=Visualization |editor1-last=Abler |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Marcus |editor2-first=Melvin G. |editor3-last=Olson |editor3-first=Judy M. |title=Geography's inner worlds: pervasive themes in contemporary American geography |series=Occasional publications of the Association of American Geographers |volume=2 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |pages=99–137 |isbn=0813518296 |oclc=25008961 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aspects allow for a more mature appropriation of space with geo-media, while being aware of and gaining insight into the construction process of meanings attached to space.
* Communication with geo-media means communicating using spatial representations. Thanks to [[usability|user-friendly]] [[web mapping]] tools within the Geoweb, users ([[prosumer]]s) can easily produce their own geo-media and share it web-wide. Collaboration features allow for the negotiation of constructions of space with other users, for example through [[volunteered geographic information]] (VGI). The study of spatial citizenship examines subjectivity, impact on everyday action, social power relations, competition, and negotiation in VGI.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Spatial citizenship also aims at increasing awareness of [[geographic information]] produced involuntarily by users through automatic data collection that many Geoweb platforms (especially mobile phones) include to support the interests of service providers (see [[location-based service]]s).

== Education ==
The goal of education for spatial citizenship is to enable learners to achieve a reflexive appropriation of space as the basis for mature action in space by reflective geo-media use and active, reflective geo-media production.&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"/&gt; Using a broad variety of learning environments orientated toward the learners' needs, the educational approach of spatial citizenship is applicable at different levels from [[primary education|primary]] to [[tertiary education]]. Apart from technological proficiency, spatial citizenship education aims at two additional main competencies:
* Being able to achieve a reflective use of geo-media, while understanding the process of the social construction of spaces, with the result of either consciously accepting given meanings or producing alternative meanings.
* Being able to communicate alternative meanings effectively with geo-media and using geo-media as instruments to support [[argumentation]] in negotiation processes on contradictory meanings.

== Scientific response ==
The [[European Commission]]-funded project SPACIT furthers education for spatial citizenship by developing teacher training standards, [[curriculum|curricula]], and learning modules for teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPACIT: education for spatial citizenship |url=http://www.spatialcitizenship.org/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-10-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another EU-funded project, digital-earth.eu, linked with the SPACIT project by connecting stakeholders using or interested in using geo-media in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital-earth.eu |url=http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112227/http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported spatial citizenship through the creation of [[Standards-based education reform|educational standards]], the collection of best-practice examples, and the provision of learning environments applicable to teachers in everyday classroom situations. Digital-earth.eu also promoted these concepts related to spatial citizenship in political circles concerned with the development of the Europe2020 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe2020: Europe's growth strategy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-11-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''Tele-epidemiology''' is the application of [[telecommunications]] to epidemiological research and application, including space-based and internet-based systems.

Tele-epidemiology applies [[Communications satellite|satellite communication systems]] to investigate or support investigations of [[infectious disease]] [[outbreak]], including disease [[Rebound effect|reemergence]]. In this application, space-based systems (i.e. [[GIS]], [[GPS]], [[SPOT_(satellite)#SPOT_5|SPOT5]]) use natural index and in-situ data (i.e. [[NDVI]], [[Meteosat]], [[Envisat]]) to assess health risk to human and animal populations. Space-based applications of tele-epidemiology extend to [[health surveillance]] and [[Emergency medical services|health emergency response]].&lt;ref name="marechael"&gt;Marechal, F., Ribeiro, N., Lafaye, M., Guell, A. (2008) Satellite imaging and vector-borne diseases: the approach of the French National Space Agency (CNES). Geospatial Health 3(1), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Internet-based applications of tele-epidemiology include sourcing of epidemiological data in generating internet reports and [[Real-time data|real-time]] [[Spatial epidemiology|disease mapping]]. This entails gathering and [[structuring]] epidemiological data from news and [[social media]] outlets, and [[Cartography|mapping]] or reporting this data for application with research or public health organizations. Examples of such applications include [[HealthMap]] and [[ProMED-mail]], two [[Web service|web-based services]] that map and e-mail global cases of disease outbreak, respectively.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;Keller, M., Blench, M., Tolentino, H., Freifeld, C.C., Mandl, K.D., Mawudeku, A., Eysenbach, G., Brownstein, J.S. (2009) Use of unstructured event-based reports for global infectious disease. Emerging Infectious Diseases 15(5), 689-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] often refers generally to [[telehealth]] for applications linking communication and information technologies such as [[telesurgery]] and [[telenursing]], to [[healthcare administration]].

== Clinical applications==
*Provides real-time information about disease prevalence across populations to public health, physicians and citizens, globally.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Diminishes [[communicable disease]] risk by mobilizing local medical efforts to respond to disease outbreaks, especially in vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Enhances the ability of managing the  proliferation of communicable [[pathogens]].&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Can be used as a management tool in public health to discover, assess, and act on [[epidemiological]] data. For example, gathering and identifying disease relevant risk factors helps to identify treatment interventions and implement the prevention strategies that could lessen the effects of the outbreak on the general population and improve clinical outcomes at the individual, patient-leve&lt;ref&gt;Wiemeken, T.L., Peyrani, P., Ramirez, J.A. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Could prove useful to commerce, travelers, public health agencies and federal governments, and diplomatic efforts.&lt;ref name="keller" /&gt;
*Public health agencies and federal governments might take advantage of Tele-epidemiology for predicting the propagation of communicable diseases.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Provides users and governments with information for [[early warning systems]].

==Non-clinical applications==
*Applications of tele-epidemiology are not being used frequently in clinical settings
*The use of space-based systems are important for research and public health efforts, though these activities are driven largely by secondary or tertiary organizations, not the public health agencies themselves.
*Relevant data can be used for research and is widely accessible through existing internet outlets. 
*Data can be disseminated through internet reports of disease outbreak for real-time disease mapping for public use.&lt;ref name="keller" /&gt; The application of HealthMap and ProMED-mail demonstrate considerable [[global health]] utility and accessibility for users from both the public and private domains.
*Internet-based platforms can be used by the general public to determine local and international disease outbreaks. Consumers can also contribute their own epidemiologically-relevant data to these services.

==Advantages==
Space-based tele-epidemiological initiatives, using satellites, are able to gather environmental information relevant to tracking disease outbreaks. S2E, a French multidisciplinary consortium on spatial surveillance of epidemics, has used satellites to garner relevant information on [[vegetation]],  [[meteorology]] and [[hydrology]]. This information, in concert with clinical data from humans and animals, can be used to construct predictive mathematical models that may allow for the forecasting of disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt; 

Web-based tele-epidemiological services are able to aggregate information from several disparate sources to provide information on disease surveillance and potential disease outbreaks. Both ProMED-mail and Healthmap collect information in several different languages to gather worldwide epidemiological information.&lt;ref name="HealthMap"&gt;HealthMap (2012) [http://www.healthmap.org/about/ About HealthMap] Last accessed December 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These services are both free and allow both health care professionals and laypeople to access reliable disease outbreak information from around the world and in real-time.

==Disadvantages==
Space-based methodologies require investment of resources for the collection and management of epidemiological information; as such, these systems may not be affordable or technologically feasible for developing countries that need assistance tracking disease outbreaks. Further, the success of space-based methodologies is predicated on the collection of accurate ground-based data by qualified public health professionals. This may not be possible in developing countries because they lack basic laboratory and epidemiological resources&lt;ref&gt;Butler, D. (2006) Disease surveillance needs a revolution. Nature 440, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based tele-epidemiological initiatives have a unique set of challenges that are different from those experienced by space-based methodologies. HealthMap, in an effort to provide comprehensive worldwide information, contains information from a variety of sources including eyewitness accounts, online news and validated official reports.&lt;ref name="HealthMap" /&gt; As a result, the site necessarily relies upon third party information, the veracity of which they are not liable.

==Biography and awards==
Born in May 1966, he is best known for his numerous [[Antarctic]] expeditions, particularly the period recreations of historical treks by Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] and Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], as well as the  record-breaking Antarctic crossing in 1999, undertaken with fellow Australian explorer [[Peter Treseder]]. As a result, he is the joint record holder for the fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic [[South Pole]] from the true edge of Antarctica (where the ice of the continent meets the sea).

He holds dual Australian/UK citizenships and spends his time primarily in Australia, with visits to the UK, the Americas, and Africa, for business and exploration-based activities and public engagements.

He is the author of ''The Unforgiving Minute'' which recounts his expeditions to the North and South Pole as well as the crossing of several Australian deserts. He is also involved in various philanthropic ventures including as a Board Member of Zoos SA (comprising [[Adelaide Zoo]] and [[Monarto Zoo]]), fundraising work with Helping Rhinos (a UK charity aiming to save rhinoceros species from extinction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpingrhinos.org/events/99/tim-jarvis-adventure-series|title=Helping Rhinos|last=|first=|date=27 September 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and his former role as councillor of the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]. He is also co-writer of a course for the Open University in environmental management. The course was linked with the [[BBC]]'s Frozen Planet series that aired in 2011.

Jarvis was accepted into the [[Yale World Fellows Program]] for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/worldfellows Yale World Fellows Program]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 9 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The program aims to broaden and strengthen the leadership skills of emerging leaders from across the world as they work on progressing thinking on global issues and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timjarvis.org/index.php?m=21 Upcoming Events/Latest News]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

For his work on the 25zero project, Jarvis was awarded Conservationist of the Year in 2016 by the Australian Geographic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/awards/2016/10/tim-jarvis-conservationist-of-the-year-2016|title=Tim Jarvis is awarded Conservationist of the Year for his 25zero project|last=|first=|date=13 October 2016|website=|publisher=Australian Geographic Society|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is subsequently the only person to ever have been awarded both Adventurer and Conservationist medallions by the Society. Jarvis was also recognised with the Society's 'Spirit of Adventure' medal for his kayak journey across [[Lake Eyre]], Australia's largest salt lake, in 2004.

He received the [[Sydney Institute of Marine Science]]’s Emerald award (their highest) in 2013 for services to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sims.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Invitation-emerald-dinner-2013.pdf|title=SIMS Emerald Dinner 2013|last=|first=|date=1 January 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreation of Douglas Mawson's expedition ==

In April 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timjarvis.org/expeditions/sir-douglas-mawson-antarctic-journey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111221132/http://www.timjarvis.org/expeditions/sir-douglas-mawson-antarctic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Jarvis completed an expedition in Antarctica where he attempted to recreate the amazing expedition and human feat of Sir [[Douglas Mawson]]. Jarvis walked close to 500&amp;nbsp;km pulling a sleigh full of supplies, and living on almost the same rations as Mawson himself. Jarvis wanted to find out if the story of Mawson was physically possible. At the end of the expedition Jarvis said, "I haven't really done what Mawson did because I have doctors checking my situation, a film crew following me and a number of other safety precautions. Mawson had none of that."

The 2008 film of the expedition is available on DVD, ''Mawson – Life and Death In Antarctica''. The summary reads, "Combining the drama of Jarvis' contemporary adventure with chilling dramatic reconstructions, expert commentary and footage from the original expedition photographed by Frank Hurley, this is an extraordinary story of human survival."  Tim is also author of a book of the same name (Melbourne University Press, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-522-85486-2}}).

== Shackleton Epic ==

In February 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/test/wp-content/uploads/SE-NEWS-RELEASE-TEAM-ARRIVES-IN-STROMNESS-11-Feb-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis and five others successfully recreated Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s epic crossing of the Southern Ocean in the ''Alexandra Shackleton'', a replica of the ''James Caird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Team sets out to recreate Shackleton's epic journey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/team-sets-out-to-replicate-shackletons-epic-journey-8436009.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 January 2013|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same materials, clothing, food and a [[Thomas Mercer Chronometers|Thomas Mercer chronometer]] as in the original voyage,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/salon-qp/10425336/thomas-mercer-legacy-marine-chronometer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis and the team sailed their replica ''James Caird'' from Elephant Island, in the Southern Ocean, to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]], just as Shackleton did in 1916.&lt;ref name="timjarvis1"&gt;[http://www.timjarvis.org/shackletonepic/ Tim Jarvis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519192452/http://www.timjarvis.org/shackletonepic/ |date=19 May 2014 }}. Retrieved on 9 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The sea voyage was followed by a trek across the mountainous interior of South Georgia to the historic whaling station of Stromness. The construction of the replica ''James Caird'' was started in June 2008 and was finished in 2010, and was officially launched on 18 March 2012 in [[Dorset]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timjarvis.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ShackletonEpicMediaNotificationFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021011605/http://www.timjarvis.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ShackletonEpicMediaNotificationFinal.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hon. Alexandra Shackleton is patron of the expedition.&lt;ref name="timjarvis1"/&gt; The project, led by Jarvis, was the first to successfully recreate the 'double' voyage using only period gear.

Members of the Shackleton's Epic crew were Nick Bubb, Barry 'Baz' Gray, Paul Larson, Seb Coulthard, and [[Ed Wardle]]. The expedition's patron was the Hon. [[Alexandra Shackleton]], granddaughter of Sir Ernest Shackleton.

Jarvis was awarded the [[Royal Institute of Navigation]]’s Certificate of Achievement, in recognition of his leadership of the Shackleton Epic Expedition Team.

A documentary of the epic crossing has been made and ''[[Shackleton: Death or Glory]]'' went to air in the UK in September 2013 on Discovery UK and Australia in November 2013 on Special Broadcasting Service Australia; titled ''Chasing Shackleton'' for the USA market, it went to air in that region in January 2014 on the Public Broadcasting Service.&lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/film/&lt;/ref&gt;

A book authored by Tim titled ''Shackleton's Epic, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival'', published by Harper Collins, went on sale in the UK and Australia in November 2013; titled ''Chasing Shackleton, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival'' for the USA market, it went on sale in January 2014 in the USA. {{ISBN|978-0-00-754952-8}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/book/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tourism geography''' is the study of [[travel]] and [[tourism]], as an industry and as a [[social]] and [[culture|cultural]] activity. Tourism geography covers a wide range of interests including the environmental [[impacts of tourism|impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.

Tourism geography is that branch of science which deals with the study of travel and its impact on places.

[[Geography]] is fundamental to the study of tourism, because tourism is geographical in nature. Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people. Physical geography provides the essential background, against which tourism places are created and environmental impacts and concerns are major issues, that must be considered in managing the development of tourism places.

The approaches to study will differ according to the varying concerns. Much tourism management literature remains [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] in methodology and considers tourism as consisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, A and Crang, M (2001) 'The trouble with tourism and travel theory?' in ''Tourist Studies'' 1(5) p.5-22&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in [[human geography]] have resulted in approaches such as those from [[cultural geography]], which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the [[sense of place]] at a destination.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, J, Urry, J and Axhausen, K (2006) ''Mobilities, Networks, Geographies'' Aldershot:Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tourist'' by Dean MacCannell and ''The Tourist Gaze'' by [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] are classics in this field.

'''Violence against prostitutes''' has been reported worldwide, both on a physical and psychological level. The victims are predominantly women, including in extreme cases murder both inside and outside the workplace.

Women working in prostitution experience more levels of violence against them than women working in other fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rodríguez Martínez, Pilar. "An Intersectional Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence and Workplace Violence among Women Working in Prostitution."''Revista Española De Investigaciones Sociologicas'' no. 151 (July 2015): 123-138. ''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[homicide]] rate for female sex workers  in the United States was estimated to be 204 per 100,000, although this figure mixes illegal work with legal work.{{sfn|Potterat|Brewer|Muth|Rothenberg|2004}} This figure is considerably higher than that for the next riskiest occupations in the United States during a similar period (4 per 100,000 for female liquor store workers and 29 per 100,000 for male taxicab drivers).{{sfn|Castillo|Jenkins|1994}}  The prevalence of violence against prostitutes varies by location.  A study of female prostitutes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada over the age of 14 who used illicit drugs other than marijuana found that 57% of prostitutes experienced some form of gender-based violence over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence and structural correlates of gender based violence among a prospective cohort of female sex workers|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2939|journal = BMJ|date = 2009-08-11|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 2725271|pmid = 19671935|pages = b2939|volume = 339|doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2939|first = Kate|last = Shannon|first2 = T.|last2 = Kerr|first3 = S.

== Types of violence ==

=== Physical ===
[[Violence|Physical violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} World report on violence and health|url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical violence is more commonly experienced by outdoor sex-workers with 47% of prostitutes working outdoors reporting being kicked, punched, or slapped in one study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In a study of prostitutes working in San Francisco, 82% of participants reported having experienced some type of physical violence since entering prostitution, with 55% of these assaults being committed by a client.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prostitution, Violence, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J013v27n03_03|journal = Women &amp; Health|pages = 37–49|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1300/j013v27n03_03|first = Melissa|last = Farley|first2 = Howard|last2 = Barkan|pmid=9698636|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found a slightly rate lower with 74% of sex-workers reported experiencing some form of physical abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History of Abuse and Psychological Distress Symptoms among Female Sex Workers in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities|journal = Violence and victims|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0886-6708|pmc = 2777761|pmid = 19634364|pages = 399–413|volume = 24|issue = 3|first = Monica|last = Ulibarri|first2 = Shirley J.|last2 = Semple|first3 = Swati|last3 = Rao|first4 = Steffanie A.|last4 = Strathdee|first5 = Miguel A.|last5 = Fraga-Vallejo|first6 = Jesus|last6 = Bucardo|first7 = Adela|last7 = De la Torre|first8 = Juan|last8 = Salazar-Reyna|first9 = Prisci|last9 = Orozovich|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.3.399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
[[Psychological abuse]], also referred to as mental abuse or emotional abuse is  characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including [[anxiety]], [[chronic depression]], or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = D.

E.|last = Thompson|first2 = C. A.|last2 = Kaplan|doi=10.1192/bjp.168.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that this type of violence "includes, but is not limited to, being insulted (e.g. called derogatory names) or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated or belittled in front of other people; being threatened with loss of custody of one's children; being confined or [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] from family or friends; being threatened with harm to oneself or someone one cares about; repeated shouting, inducing fear through [[intimidating]] words or gestures; [[controlling behavior]]; and the destruction of possessions."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are certain types of psychological or emotional abuse that sex workers are more prone to such as denial of basic needs, forced drug or alcohol consumption, and being arrested for carrying condoms to name a few.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Women working in prostitution are especially vulnerable to psychological abuse, particularly [[verbal abuse]], because many customers and other members of society view them as "whores" or as generally undesirable women. Often verbal abuse will occur either while the service is being given, or after it has been given and the customer is not satisfied. In both these cases, verbal abuse can be a precursor to sexual violence from the client.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In one study, 78% of sex-workers reported having experienced emotional or psychological abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual ===
[[Sexual violence]] is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion, unwanted sexual comments or advances, acts to traffic a person or acts directed against a person's sexuality, regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

(1998). ''Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict''.  Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur,&lt;/ref&gt;  The risks of sexual abuse are overall lower than the risks of physical abuse. with the exception of indoor prostitutes who report a higher rate of rape or attempted rape than any one type of physical violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In one study, 44% of sex-workers reported having experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rates of sexual assault and rape are higher among women (including transgender women) than among men, though the overall rate is high with one study finding that 68% of respondents had been raped since entering prostitution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These high levels of sexual violence suffered by sex workers have very traumatic effects on the men and women working as prostitutes. High levels of rape other forms of sexual violence while working as a prostitute have been linked to higher levels of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Contributing factors ==
Studies have shown that younger sex-workers tend to experience more client violence than their older colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Furthermore, cisgender and transgender female sex workers are also more likely to experience violence committed by a client than their male sex worker counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Legal vs illegal sex work ===
Laws prohibiting prostitution can make it difficult for the men and women engaging in prostitution to report any violence they may experience while on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=hwlj|title = For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politician and Judges|last = Almodovar|first = Norma Jean|date = January 1, 1999|journal = Hastings Women's Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often transactions or arrangements to meet up with clients must be made in secret in places where prostitution is illegal.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Barnard, Marina A.

''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The decriminalization of sex work in New Zealand has shown that violence is reduced when sex workers are not forced to work alone, or in isolated places. Sex work was always legal in New Zealand but decriminalization removed laws that increased danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/parl-support/research-papers/00PLSocRP12051/prostitution-law-reform-in-new-zealand|title=New Zealand Parliament - Prostitution Law Reform in New Zealand|work=Parliament.nz|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrators ==

===Violent clients, pimps and police officers===
Perpetrators may include violent clients and [[pimps]]. Clients oftentimes attempt to maintain a power balance that favors them over the prostitutes.  This is often done through different methods of violence such as sexual, emotional, and physical.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Though pimps may be perpetrators of violence against sex workers with 53% of sex workers in one study reporting that violence at the hands of pimps is a major problem, 33% of subjects interviewed in that same study reported that the main benefit to having a pimp is the protection from potential assault.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ca066bbe-c370-4f90-a033-f2ed967c0e92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=120|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the illegality of sex work in many parts of the world, sex workers often have to service clients in discreet and isolated spaces where they are less likely to get caught by the police. Because of this isolation, sex workers are made more vulnerable to attacks by their clients. According to a study conducted on one hundred and thirty people working in [[San Francisco]] as street sex workers, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon and 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918115439/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the United States sex work is illegal, and so sex workers are not able to report violence done against them in fear of being arrested themselves. In certain states anti-prostitution mandates carry a minimum sentence and can increase to felony charge after multiple arrests, which leads to difficulty finding housing and employment, and disqualification for welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Melissa Gira. "The War on Sex Workers." ''Reason.com''. N.p., 21 Jan. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally sex workers may be registered as sex offenders, or face deportation if they have precarious migratory or citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahab | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Panichelli | first2 = Meg | year = 2013 | title = Ethical and Human Rights Issues in Coercive Interventions With Sex Workers | url = | journal = Journal of Women and Social Work | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 344–49 | doi=10.1177/0886109913505043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the stigma that exists around sex work, police are less likely to investigate attacks on sex workers.{{sfn|Wong|Holroyd|Bingham|2011}}  As one sex worker in South Africa reports "to gather evidence of a crime against a sex worker, they have to first take it seriously,”. “If we go to the police to report abuse, we’re made fun of, we’re told ‘you deserve it.’ They chase you away,” notes another sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2011/12/15/ending-police-abuse-sex-workers/|title=Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored|last=Mgbako|first=Chi|date=December 15, 2011|website=Rewire|publisher=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers themselves are common perpetrators of violence against prostitutes. A study of sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found that half of the women had been beaten by police and about a third had been gang-raped by police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "In South Africa, where sex work has been illegal since the former apartheid regime criminalized it in 1957, police officers often fine sex workers inordinate sums of money and pocket the cash, resulting in a pattern of economic extortion of sex workers by state agents."&lt;ref&gt;Mgbako, Chi. "Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored." ''Rewire''. Rewire, 15 Dec. 2011. Web. 04 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serial killers===
[[File:Jack the ripper.jpg|thumb|Jack the Ripper attacks a woman]]
Sex workers (particularly those engaging in [[street prostitution]]) are also sometimes targeted by [[serial killer]]s, who may consider them easy targets and less likely to be missed, or who use the religious and social stigma associated with sex workers as justification for their murder.

The unidentified serial killer known as [[Jack the Ripper]] killed at least five sex workers in [[London]] in 1888. Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.

[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in [[Northern England]].

[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.

[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.

[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

In December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).

== Efforts to combat ==
Most efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By sex workers ===
Because of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many sex workers have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.  A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that "40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Michelle S | year = 1999 | title = Prostitutes, Drug Users, and Thieves: The Invisible Women in the Campaign to End Violence Against Women | url = | journal = Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 459–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government policy ===
[[File:Sex Worker Rights - London SlutWalk 2011.jpg|thumb|Sex Workers' Rights demonstration at London SlutWalk 2011]]
[[UN Women]] supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;UN Women. "Notes on Sex Work, Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking." NSWP (2013).  Accessed September 23, 2015. http://www.nswp.org/resource/un-womens-note-sex-work-sexual-exploitation-and-trafficking&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, however, the United States of America requires that all countries it gives aid to for AIDS/HIV+ prevention and relief agree to an "[[anti-prostitution pledge]]" that dictates that the country receiving aid must adopt policy that treats sex work and prostitution the same as sex trafficking.  This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Lerum, Kari."Reducing Violence against Sex Workers: What are the policy options?." Human Rights for All (2011). Accessed September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.  Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Wolong National Nature Reserve''' ({{zh|s=卧龙自然保护区|t=臥龍自然保護區|p=Wòlóng Zìránbǎohùqū}}) is a [[protected area]] located in [[Wenchuan County]], [[Sichuan Province]], People's Republic of China. Established in 1963 with an initial size of about 20,000 hectares, the reserve was further expanded in 1975, covering an area of about 200,000 hectares in the [[Qionglai Mountains]] region. There are over 4,000 different species recorded in the reserve.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm About Wolong], Wolong National Natural Reserve.&lt;/ref&gt; According to China's Third National Giant Panda Survey, Wolong National Nature Reserve houses about 150 wild individuals of highly endangered [[giant panda]]s. The reserve is also a home to many other endangered species including: [[snow leopard]]s, [[red pandas]], [[golden snub-nosed monkey|golden monkey]]s, [[white-lipped deer]] and many precious plants. Before the devastating [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|2008 Wenchuan earthquake]] Wolong got up to 200,000 visitors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Wei|last2=Vogt|first2=Christine A.|last3=Luo|first3=Junyan|last4=He|first4=Guangming|last5=Frank|first5=Kenneth A.|last6=Liu|first6=Jianguo|date=2012-04-25|title=Drivers and Socioeconomic Impacts of Tourism Participation in Protected Areas|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035420|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=4|pages=e35420|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0035420|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3338832|pmid=22558149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Wei|last2=Vogt|first2=Christine A.|last3=Lupi|first3=Frank|last4=He|first4=Guangming|last5=Ouyang|first5=Zhiyun|last6=Liu|first6=Jianguo|date=2016-02-01|title=Evolution of tourism in a flagship protected area of China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2015.1071380|journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism|volume=24|issue=2|pages=203–226|doi=10.1080/09669582.2015.1071380|issn=0966-9582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area is superseded by the [[Wolong Special Administrative Region]].

== Background ==
In June 1980, the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda was established at Wolong with the efforts of both [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund (WWF)]] and the Chinese government. To this date, researchers have conducted many breeding research projects on giant pandas and have successfully bred 66 panda cubs.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Lil regale 04Infl China Sichuan Wolong 18 06 04.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Lilium regale]]'', a local native flower]]
A mountain stream runs through the Wolong Valley (where the reserve is); the stream is heavily armoured with boulders and smaller rounded stones.  Stream waters are rather [[alkaline]] with [[pH]] levels in the range of 8.91. (Hogan, 2007)  [[Water quality]] [[turbidity]] is quite high due to extensive sand and [[gravel]] mining in stream.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.M., Lumina Tech, ''Environmental analysis of the Wolong National Nature Reserve'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2001 research by Dr. Jianguo Liu of [[Michigan State University]], the rate of destruction is higher after the reserve's creation than before its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Jianuo, Marc Linderman, Zhiyun Ouyang, Li An, Jian Yang, and Hemin Zhang. "Ecological Degradation in Protected Areas: The Case of Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas." ''Science'' 292.5514 (2001): 98-101. Web. 18 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[NASA]]'s satellite images and records of population, Liu's research team concluded that due to tourism and the increase in local population, the reserve is facing an unprecedented threat. "Tourists don't think they have an impact on panda habitat, but indirectly each visitor has some impact," Liu said. "We don't see ourselves as a destructive force, but we are."&lt;ref&gt;(April 6, 2001) [http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2001/2001-04-06-02.asp Endangered Pandas Not Safe in Chinese Nature Reserve], Environment News Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
The giant panda is the most famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are the [[Ussuri dhole]], [[Asian black bear]], [[Asiatic golden cat]], [[red panda]], [[hog badger]] and [[yellow-throated marten]]. Hooved mammals are represented by [[Sichuan takin]]s, [[wild boar]], [[musk deer]], [[mainland serow]]s, [[Chinese goral]]s, [[tufted deer]] and [[sambar deer]]. Other noticeable mammals include [[golden snub-nosed monkey]]s, [[Tibetan macaque]]s, [[complex-toothed flying squirrel]]s, [[Rhizomys|bamboo rat]]s, and [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]]s.&lt;ref name="Johnson1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson, Kenneth G. |author2=Wei, Wang |author3=Reid, Donald G. |author4=Jinchu, Hu |title=Food Habits of Asiatic Leopards (''Panthera pardus fusea'') in Wolong Reserve, Sichuan, China |work=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=74 |number=3 |date=August 1993 |pages=646–650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like [[clouded leopard]]s and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like [[white-lipped deer]], [[snow leopard]]s and [[Turkestan lynx]]es.&lt;ref name="Riley&amp;Riley2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riley |first1=William |last2=Riley |first2=Laura |title=Nature´s Strongholds.

Camera-trap surveys conducted in the reserve area between 2005 and 2009 did not record any [[leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Li, S., Wang, D., Lu, Z. &amp; Mc Shea, W.J. |year=2010 |title=Cats living with pandas: The status of wild felids within giant panda range, China |journal=Cat News 52 |pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
