      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7939">'''''A Nervous Smile''''' is a play written by [[John Belluso]] that was originally commissioned by the [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]. It opened March 4, 2005 for the 29th annual [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belluso|first1=John|title=A Nervous Smile|date=2006|publisher=Dramatists Play Services Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8222-2095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/|title=Humana Festival of New American Plays - Actors Theatre of Louisville|website=Actors Theatre of Louisville|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was originally directed by [[David Esbjornson]] and starred Sean Haberle as Brian, Maureen Mueller as Eileen, Mhari Sandoval as Nic, and [[Dale Soules]] as Blanka. Unseen characters include heavy reference to Brian and Eileen's child Emily and Nic's son Dominic, both of whom have severe [[cerebral palsy]] as well as to Nic's ex-husband and Blanka's adult daughter. The story is set in a present-day Manhattan apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anervoussmile.wordpress.com/the-play/|title=The Play|website=A Nervous Smile|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==

'''Brian:''' Husband to Eileen in his late 30s, a college professor and failed novelist. Throughout the play he struggles to understand his place as father to a child with cerebral palsy and also grapples with his relationship to his wife and to the woman he is having an affair with.

'''Eileen:''' Wife to Brian in her early 40s. A multi-millionaire from investing in her father's company, she is snobbish, alcoholic, and regularly pops pills ([[Vicodine]] and [[Oxycontin]] being the two primarily mentioned and utilized drugs). She doesn't have any desire to be raising a child with cerebral palsy but also feels a motherly instinct to remain with Emily that Brian doesn't appear to feel.

'''Nic:''' A single mom who was once good friends with Eileen. She is now having an affair with Brian. She works as a lawyer who can hardly support her son Dominic, who has severe cerebral palsy. She initially agrees to run away with Brian but freezes up at the last moment and decides she must stay with her son.

'''Blanka:''' Brian and Eileen's maid in her late 50s. She is originally from Russia and is the one who actually cares for Emily. Blanka knows Emily's secrets and is the only character in this play to acknowledge Emily as a real person.

== Plot ==

=== Act I ===
The play begins with Brian, Eileen, and Nic returning to Brian and Eileen's apartment in Manhattan. They've just come from the funeral of a child from the Cerebral Palsy Support Group that the three attend. They stopped at a bar on their way home and seem to show an overall lack of empathy for the family of the child that passed. There are clear tensions among the three and while Eileen is out of the room it is revealed that Brian is having an affair with Nic. You then find out that offstage Emily is having a seizure and Eileen once again exits to calm her daughter. While she is away Brian admits his and Eileen's plan. He tells Nic of his dreams to live with her in Buenos Aires and this can happen because Eileen is going to grant him a divorce as well as half of his money ($10 million) and a promise that they will never see one another again. The couple have planned to abandon Emily at the emergency room in the middle of the night. Brian wants Nic to come with him and insists that she call Dominic's father to have him pick up their son so Nic can run away with Brian. The act ends with Eileen returning to the living room and encouraging Nic to go with the plan and to love Brian. Just before the blackout, Nic agrees to go.

=== Act II ===
This act opens during the middle of the next night, the night in which they plan on abandoning their children and running away. Nic arrives at the apartment early feeling overwhelmed and needing to begin the plan immediately. Brian agrees and goes to wake Eileen and gather her things. While he does so, Nic is left alone. Suddenly, Blanka wakes from where she is sleeping under a blanket on the living room couch. She speaks with Nic and tries to understand why Nic feels the need to abandon her child and Blanka works desperately to convince Nic to stay. Nic, in response, tells her of one of the 'bad days' Dominic had recently and how overwhelmed she has become caring for him, reasoning that because of this her only option is to leave. The scene ends with Brian carrying a sleeping Emily out the door with Nic and Eileen close on his heels.

=== Act III ===
This act begins once more in the Manhattan apartment. Nic and Eileen sit in the living room. The audience learns that Brian left Nic at the airport security check when she began to have second thoughts about running away with him and abandoning her son. It is also revealed that Eileen had fallen into a drug-induced sleep at her own gate and missed her flight to London. Police found them both and they were quickly arrested for child abandonment. Nic has luckily been granted shared custody of her son. However, Eileen is likely to lose Emily and is having to pack up her things which will be picked up by social workers as Emily is going into foster care. As the two women reflect on their shared experiences the image of Brian (wherever he is in the world) appears and he expresses his true hatred for Emily and everything she represents to him. Blanka then returns, having spent all of the money that Brian originally paid her to not go to the police. In an emotional outburst, she convinces Eileen to listen to some of Emily's poems which is the last thing the audience hears as the lights go out. They hear a robotic communication board voice slowly becoming the voice of a little girl.

== Augmented communication ==
In some cases of cerebral palsy, the damage is so severe that is affects the person's speech and language abilities. While they may be able to have complex thoughts and ideas, their muscles and vocal chords are unable to form the words that they are trying to express. Augmented forms of communication can vary greatly and include non-technology picture boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amyspeechlanguagetherapy.com/communication-boards.html|title=Communication Boards|website=Amy Speech &amp; Language Therapy, Inc.|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; text boards and digitized speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioddev.org/inventory_detail.php?equip_id=2657|title=Institute on Disabilities {{!}} Programs {{!}} Assistive Technology {{!}} PATLL {{!}}ECO2 Communication Device|website=www.ioddev.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Nervous Smile,'' we see the two different ends of the augmented communication spectrum, with Dominic possessing a basic communication board and Emily having both an advanced wheelchair and advanced augmented communication that can provide a voice, save things she's said, and predict what she will say.

The {{Nihongo|'''Agency for Cultural Affairs'''|文化庁|bunkachō}} is a special body of the [[Japan]]ese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). It was set up in 1968 to promote Japanese arts and culture. As of April 2018, it is led by the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, [[Ryohei Miyata]].  

The agency's budget for FY 2017 rose to ¥104.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=8 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the [[Cultural Properties Protection Division]] protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, art [[copyrights]], and improvements in the [[Japanese language|national language]]. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and film-making. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and [[The National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the [[Japan Art Academy]], which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who personally bestows the highest accolade, the [[Order of Culture]]. In 1989, for the first time two women — a writer and a costume designer — were nominated for the [[Order of Culture|Order of Cultural Merit]], another official honor carrying the same stipend.

The Cultural Properties Protection Division originally was established to oversee restorations after [[World War II]]. As of April 2017, it was responsible for 1,784 historic sites, including the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Heijō Palace|Heijokyo]], and [[Fujiwara-kyō|Fujiwara]], 402 scenic places, and 1,024 national monuments, and for such indigenous fauna as [[ibis]] and [[stork]]s. In addition, about 13,500 items had the lesser designation of [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]], with fine arts and crafts accounting for the largest share, with over 10,000 so designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=38 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government protects buried properties, of which some 300,000 had been identified. During the 1980s, many important prehistoric and historic sites were investigated by the archaeological institutes that the agency funded, resulting in about 2,000 excavations in 1989. The wealth of material unearthed shed new light on the controversial period of the formation of the Japanese state.

A 1975 amendment to the [[Cultural Properties Protection Act]] of 1897 enabled the Agency for Cultural Affairs to designate traditional areas and buildings in urban centers for preservation. From time to time, various endangered traditional artistic skills are added to the agency's preservation roster, such as the 1989 inclusion of a kind of ancient doll making.

One of the most important roles of the Cultural Properties Protection Division is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and performing arts through their living exemplars. Individual artists and groups, such as a dance troupe or a pottery village, are designated as ''[[Intangible Cultural Property (Japan)|mukei bunkazai]]'' (intangible cultural assets) in recognition of their skill. Major exponents of the traditional arts have been designated as ''[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|ningen kokuho]]'' (living national treasures). About seventy persons are so honored at any one time; in 1989 the six newly designated masters were a ''[[Kyōgen|kyogen]]'' (comic) performer, a chanter of ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet) theater, a performer of the ''nagauta [[shamisen]]'' (a special kind of stringed instrument), the head potter making [[Imari porcelain|Nabeshima]] decorated porcelain ware, the top pictorial [[lacquer-ware]] artist, and a metal-work expert. Each was provided a lifetime annual pension of ￥2 million and financial aid for training disciples.

A number of institutions come under the aegis of the Agency for Cultural Affairs: the national museums of Japanese and Asian art in [[Tokyo National Museum|Tokyo]], [[Kyoto National Museum|Kyoto]], [[Nara National Museum|Nara]], [[National Museum of Art, Osaka|Osaka]] and [[Kyushu National Museum|Fukuoka]], the cultural properties research institutes at Tokyo and Nara, and the national theaters. During the 1980s, the [[National Noh Theatre]] and the [[National Bunraku Theater]] were constructed by the government.

The agency is based in the [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda Ward]] of [[Tokyo]]. Its relocation to [[Kyoto]] is scheduled by [[Fiscal year#Japan|fiscal]] 2021.&lt;ref name="organization"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organization |url = http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/about/organization/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amazing Grace''''' is a 2006 British-American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Michael Apted]], about the campaign against the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the [[British Empire]], led by [[William Wilberforce]], who was responsible for steering anti-slave trade legislation through the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. The title is a reference to the [[hymn]] "[[Amazing Grace]]". The film also recounts the experiences of [[John Newton]] as a crewman on a slave ship and subsequent [[religious conversion]], which inspired his writing of the poem later used in the hymn. Newton is portrayed as a major influence on Wilberforce and the abolition movement.

The film premiered on 16 September 2006 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], followed by showings at the [[Heartland Film Festival]], the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], and the [[European Film Market]], before opening in wide US release on 23 February 2007,&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt; which coincided with the 200th anniversary of the date the British parliament voted to [[Slave Trade Act 1807|ban the slave trade]].

==Plot==
In 1796, William Wilberforce is severely ill and taking a recuperative holiday in [[Bath, Somerset]], with his cousin, [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]]. It is here that William is introduced to his future wife, [[Barbara Spooner Wilberforce|Barbara Spooner]]. Although he initially resists any romantic overtures, she convinces him to relate the story of his career.

The story flashes back 15 years to 1782, and William recounts the events that led him to where he is now. Beginning as a young, ambitious, and popular Member of Parliament (MP), he experiences a [[Born again Christian|religious enlightenment]] and aligns himself with the [[Low Church|evangelical wing]] of the [[Church of England]]. William contemplates leaving politics to study theology, but is persuaded by his friends [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Hannah More]], and [[Olaudah Equiano]] that he will be more effective doing the work of God by taking on the unpopular and dangerous issue of the abolition of the British [[slave trade]]. His conviction in the cause deepens following a meeting with his former mentor John Newton (introduced sweeping a church floor dressed in [[sackcloth]]) who is said to live "in the company of 20,000 ghosts... slaves". As a former slave ship captain turned Christian, he deeply regrets his past life and the effects on his fellow man. Newton urges William to take up the cause.

Pitt becomes Prime Minister and William becomes a key supporter and confidant. Pitt gives William the opportunity to present a bill before the house outlawing the slave trade. William's passionate campaigning leads him to become highly unpopular in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He is opposed by a coalition of MPs representing vested interests of the slave trade in London, Bristol, [[Glasgow]], and [[Liverpool]] led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] and the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]]. Despite popular support and the assistance of an unlikely ally in the form of [[Charles James Fox]], William's bill to abolish the slave trade goes down to defeat. Afterward, the film portrays [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] as one of his few friends and allies remaining in Parliament, however even their relationship becomes strained. Pitt, now facing the stresses of leading a [[Minority government|shaky coalition]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], tells William that his cause must now wait for a more stable political climate.

William keeps up the fight but after years of failure he is left exhausted and frustrated that he was unable to change anything in the government. Believing his life's work has been in vain, he becomes physically ill (in the film he is depicted as suffering from chronic [[colitis]] which causes him to become addicted to [[laudanum]] prescribed for the crippling pain), which brings the story back up to 1797. Having virtually given up hope, William considers leaving politics forever. Barbara convinces him to keep fighting because there is no other person who is willing or able to do so. A few days afterward, William and Barbara marry. Several years pass with no further success. William's wife and new children provide him with the support and strength needed to carry on the fight.

Finally, with a renewed hope for success William devises a backdoor method of [[Fabian strategy|slowly weakening the slave trade through seemingly innocuous legislation]]. Aided by Thornton, Clarkson, and new ally [[James Stephen (British politician)|James Stephen]] and cheered on by the now terminally ill Pitt, he reintroduces his bill to abolish the slave trade. In time, after the 20-year campaign and many attempts to bring legislation forward, he is eventually responsible for a [[Slave Trade Act 1807|bill being passed through Parliament]] in 1807, which abolishes the slave trade in the [[British Empire]] forever.

The film was shot primarily in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], Yorkshire.

Shooting took place during October 2005 and involved the [[tall ship]]s, ''[[Kaskelot (tall ship)|Kaskelot]]'', ''Earl of Pembroke'', ''[[Johanna Lucretia]]'' and ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;Full details of the filming can be found at Gloucester Docks and the Sharpness Canal website – [http://www.gloucesterdocks.me.uk/gloucester/filming.htm Filming "Amazing Grace"] and details of the ships used at [http://www.gloucesterdocks.me.uk/vessels/squaresail.htm Square Sail on the Canal].&lt;/ref&gt; During January 2006, the scenes from The Houses of Parliament were shot at the 1743 Church within [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]]. The wedding scene was filmed at [[Garsington]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/garsington-st-mary/|title=St Mary, Garsington|work=A Church Near You|publisher=Archbishops' Council|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Amazing Grace'' received positive reviews. [[Philip French]] described the film as "not exactly innovative" and compared it to "earnestly worthy prewar Warner Brothers cinebiographies".

==Life and career==
Dr Sprinkle was born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to a [[Russian-Jewish]] mother and a [[Polish-Jewish]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url = http://shtetlmontreal.com/2011/02/18/dr-annie-sprinkle-on-shtetl/|title=Dr. Annie Sprinkle on ''Shtetl''|series=Shtetl: Your Alternative Jewish Magazine|airdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as the "prostitute and porn star turned sex educator and artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seductive aesthetics of postcolonialism|first=Rekha|last=Menon|publisher=Hampton Press|date=May 1, 2010|quote="How can one miss, the ''Sex Goddess,'' Annie Sprinkle (the postporn modern artist), Tantric inspired cosmic Kali, Sprinkle as the Neo Sacred Prostitute / Goddess.

She then performed two-women shows with [[Elizabeth Stephens|Beth Stephens]] titled ''Exposed; Experiments in Love, Sex, Death and Art'', ''Dirty Sex Ecology'', ''Earthly: An Ecosex Bootcamp'', and ''Ecosex Walking Tour.''&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Lawrence &amp; [[Ellen Evert Hopman]] (1996) ''People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out.'' (Reissued as ''Being a Pagan: Druids, Wiccans &amp; Witches Today'' in 2002. Destiny Books. {{ISBN|0-89281-904-9}}.) Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work and publications, spanning over four decades, are studied in courses at numerous universities, in theater history, [[women's studies]], [[performance studies]], GLBTQ studies, and [[film studies]] courses. She also is a faculty member at the Oakland, California-based [[The New School of Erotic Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vitzthum | first = Virginia | title = Annie Sprinkle swims forward | url = http://www.salon.com/health/col/vitz/2000/02/08/sprinkle/ | work = [[Salon.com]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = February 8, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ellen Steinberg, Dr Sprinkle began working at the ticket booth at Tucson's Plaza Cinema at 18, when ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was playing.&lt;ref name=rialto&gt;{{cite web | title = Annie Sprinkle: The Early Years (audio podcast interview) | url = http://www.therialtoreport.com/2013/04/07/podcast-05-annie-sprinkle-the-early-years/ | website = therialtoreport.com | publisher = The Rialto Report | date = April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was busted, and when Steinberg had to appear in court as a witness, she met and fell in love with ''Deep Throat's'' director, [[Gerard Damiano]], and became his mistress, following him to New York City, where she lived for twenty-two years.&lt;ref name=rialto /&gt; Not long after becoming Damiano's mistress, Steinberg began working in porn herself and, at that time, started calling herself '''“Annie.”''' (Below can be found more details about the stage name she adopted.) Annie's first porn movie was ''Teenage Deviate,'' which was released in 1975. Perhaps her best known mainstream porn featured role was in ''Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle'' (co-directed by Sprinkle and sexploitation veteran [[Joseph W. Sarno]]) which was the No. 2 grossing porn film of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 18, 2009|first=Reg|last=Little|work=Oxford Times|title=Iffley and the former porn star|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/4435987.Iffley_and_the_former_porn_star/|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Annie Sprinkle Neo Sacred Prostitute.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork depicting Annie Sprinkle as "The Neo Sacred Prostitute" (own concept).]]
In 1991, Sprinkle created the ''Sluts and Goddesses'' workshop, which became the basis for her 1992 production ''The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop – Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps,'' which was co-produced and co-directed with videographer [[Maria Beatty]], and featured music by composer [[Pauline Oliveros]]. Sprinkle pioneered new genres of sexually explicit film and video such as edu-porn, gonzo, post porn, xxx docudrama, art porn, and feminist erotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chandler | first = Meghan | title = The erotic anatomies of Charles Estienne and Annie Sprinkle | journal = [[Porn Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–401 | doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.958385 | date = October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle has also presented many sex workshops with fellow sex facilitator [[Barbara Carrellas]], with whom she presented the stage production ''Metamorphosex.''&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt;

She starred in [[Nick Zedd]]'s experimental films ''War Is Menstrual Envy'' (1992), ''Ecstasy in Entropy'' (1999), and ''Electra Elf: The Beginning'' (2005).

Dr Sprinkle has appeared in almost 200 films, including [[hard-core pornography|hard-]] and [[softcore pornography]], [[B movie]]s, loops, numerous documentaries, various TV shows including four [[HBO]] ''[[Real Sex]]'' programs. She has also produced, directed, and starred in several of her own films, such as ''Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn,'' ''Annie Sprinkle's Amazing World of Orgasm,'' and ''Linda/Les &amp; Annie--The First Female to Male Transsexual Love Story.'' These films played in hundreds of film festivals, in museums and galleries. Her work in adult films earned her a spot on the Adult Star Path of Fame in [[Edison, New Jersey]], and she was inducted to both the [[List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame|AVN Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Starr |first1=Astoria |title=13 AVN Hall of Fame 80's and 90's Stars: Where Are They Now? |url=https://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/13-avn-hall-of-fame-80s-and-90s-stars-where-are-they-now/ |date=12 May 2016 |publisher=therichest.com |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]] in 1999. For three decades, she has presented her work as a visiting artist at many major universities and colleges in the US and Europe. Currently her lecture presentation is called "My Life and Work as a Feminist Porn Activist, Radical Sex Educator, and Ecosexual." She has also presented dozens of "Free Sidewalk Sex Clinics," offering free sex education to the public in public space.

Dr Sprinkle's work has always been about sexuality, with a political, spiritual, and artistic bent. In December 2005, she committed to doing seven years of art projects about love with her art collaborator and eventual wife, Beth Stephens. They called this their ''Love Art Laboratory.'' Part of their project was to do an experimental art wedding each year, and each year had a different theme and color. The seven-year structure was adapted to their project by invitation of artist [[Linda Montano|Linda M. Montano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benn |first=D. |title=Annie Sprinkle on the Adult Star Path of Fame: 43 Stars Laid in New Jersey |url=http://www.pornonewsnetwork.com/news.php?id=863 |website=pornonewsnetwork.com |publisher=Porno News Network |date=2006 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle and Stephens have done twenty-one art weddings, eighteen with ecosexual themes. They married the Earth, Sky, Sea, Moon, Appalachian Mountains, the Sun, and other non-human entities in nine different countries.

Dr Sprinkle and her partner [[Beth Stephens]] became pioneers of ecosexuality, a kind of earth-loving sexual identity, which states, “The Earth is our lover.” Their Ecosex Manifesto proclaims that anyone can identify as an Ecosexual along with being “GLBTQI, heterosexual, asexual, and/or Other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sexecology.org/research-writing/ecosex-manifesto/ | title=Ecosex Manifesto | accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Sprinkle has also long championed sex worker rights and health care. She has also worked as a prostitute from 1973-1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bell | first = Shannon | author-link = Shannon Bell | contribution = Writing the prostitute body: feminist reproductions | editor-last = Bell | editor-first = Shannon | editor-link = Shannon Bell | title = Reading, writing, and rewriting the prostitute body | pages = 79–80, 203 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780253208590 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpZRowUJfgUC&amp;pg=PA203 Preview.]&lt;br /&gt;

Dr Sprinkle identifies as a [[sex-positive feminist]], and much of her activist and sex education work reflects this philosophy. In 2009, she appeared in the French documentary film ''Mutantes: Punk, Porn, Feminism,'' speaking about the beginnings of the movement as well as her own contributions to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1576434/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title=Mutantes at IMDb| accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dr Sprinkle and her wife/collaborator [[Beth Stephens]] were official artists in [[Documenta 14]], widely considered to be the most significant art exhibition in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. They presented performances and visual art, lectured, and previewed their new film documentary, Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/nature-ecosexual-annie-sprinkle-porn-star-queer|title=Nature is your lover, not your mother: meet ecosexual pioneer Annie Sprinkle|last=Theobald|first=Stephanie|date=2017-05-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGx-s9gj6rM|title=Video: "Ecosexual Walking Tour" of female porn activist Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens in Kassel during documenta 14.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
As noted above, Steinberg first gave herself the name '''“Annie”''' when she started working in pornography. As her career continued, she had an epiphany one night and she says that on that night," as if from the goddess herself," the name '''“Annie Sprinkle”''' came to her. She thought the name appropriate because "I was attracted by the sprinkles over ice cones (I am a bit of a sugaraholic!) and I love waterfalls, urine, vaginal fluids, sweat, anything wet. So the name 'Annie Sprinkle' seemed perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annie Sprinkle |work=Miradas |language=Spanish |url=http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |others=escrito por Redacción de Miradas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501234022/http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |archive-date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:compotier avec fruits, violon et verre.jpg|thumb|250px|''Composition with Fruit, Guitar and Glass'', 1912, [[Pablo Picasso]]]]
'''Appropriation''' in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009. pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the [[history of the arts]] ([[literature|literary]], [[visual arts|visual]], [[music]]al and performing arts). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp]].

Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work '''recontextualizes''' whatever it borrows to create the new work. In most cases the original 'thing' remains accessible as the original, without change.

==Definition==
Appropriation has been defined as "the taking over, into a work of art, of a real object or even an existing work of art."&lt;ref name="Tate Terms"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Wilson |first1=Simon |last2=Lack |first2=Jessica |title=The Tate Guide to Modern Art Terms |url= |place=London |publisher=[[Tate Publishing Ltd]] |pages=20–21 |year=2008|isbn=978-1-85437-750-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate Gallery]] traces the practise back to [[Cubism]] and [[Dadaism]], but continuing into 1940s [[Surrealism]] and 1950s [[Pop art]]. It returned to prominence in the 1980s with the [[Neo-minimalism|Neo-Geo]] artists.&lt;ref name="Tate Terms" /&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
In the early twentieth century [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] appropriated objects from a non-art context into their work.  In 1912, Picasso pasted a piece of oil cloth onto the canvas. Subsequent compositions, such as  ''Guitar, Newspaper, Glass and Bottle'' (1913) in which Picasso used newspaper clippings to create forms, became categorized as ''synthetic [[cubism]]''.  The two artists incorporated aspects of the "real world" into their canvases, opening up discussion of signification and [[representation (arts)|artistic representation]].

[[Marcel Duchamp]] is credited with introducing the concept of the '''ready-made''', in which "industrially produced utilitarian objects...achieve the status of art merely through the process of selection and presentation."&lt;ref&gt;Elger, D. (2006). Dadaism. Koln: Taschen, pp. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp explored this notion as early as 1913 when he mounted a stool with a bicycle wheel and again in 1915 when he purchased a snow shovel and humorously inscribed it  “in advance of the broken arm, Marcel Duchamp.”&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D (ed.).(2009). ''Appropriation: Documents of contemporary art''. London and Cambridge: Whitechapel Gallery and the MIT Press, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, Duchamp formally submitted a [[readymade]] into the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibition under the pseudonym, R. Mutt.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', it consisted of a porcelain urinal that was propped atop a pedestal and signed "R. Mutt 1917".  The work posed a direct challenge to traditional perceptions of fine art, ownership, originality and plagiarism, and was subsequently rejected by the exhibition committee.&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"&gt;Plant, S. (1992). [https://monoskop.org/images/2/24/Plant_Sadie_The_Most_Radical_Gesture_The_Situationist_International_in_a_Postmodern_Age.pdf The most radical gesture: The Situationist International in a postmodern age]. London and New York: Routledge, pp.44&lt;/ref&gt;  Duchamp publicly defended ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', claiming "whether Mr.Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance.  He CHOSE it.  He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view—and created a new thought for that object."&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"/&gt;

The [[Dada]] movement (including Duchamp as an associate) continued with the appropriation of everyday objects. Dada works featured deliberate irrationality and the rejection of the prevailing standards of art. [[Kurt Schwitters]], who produced art at the same time as the Dadaists, shows a similar sense of the bizarre in his "merz" works. He constructed these from found objects,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and they took the form of large constructions that later generations would call [[installation art|installation]]s.

The [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], coming after the Dada movement, also incorporated the use of '[[found objects]]' such as [[Méret Oppenheim]]'s ''Object (Luncheon in Fur)'' (1936).  These objects took on new meaning when combined with other unlikely and unsettling objects.

In 1938 Joseph Cornell produced what might be considered the first work of film appropriation{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} in his randomly cut and reconstructed film ''Rose Hobart''.

In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] used what he dubbed "combines", literally combining readymade objects such as tires or beds, painting, [[Screen-printing|silk-screens]], collage, and photography.  Similarly, [[Jasper Johns]], working at the same time as Rauschenberg, incorporated found objects into his work.

The [[Fluxus]] art movement also utilised appropriation:{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} its members blended different artistic disciplines including visual art, music, and literature. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s they staged "action" events and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials.

Along with artists such as [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Andy Warhol]] appropriated images{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} from commercial art and popular culture as well as the techniques of these industries. Often called "[[pop art]]ists", they saw mass popular culture as the main vernacular culture, shared by all irrespective of education. These artists fully engaged with the ephemera produced from this mass-produced culture, embracing expendability and distancing themselves from the evidence of an artist's hand.

In 1958 Bruce Conner produced the influential ''A Movie'' in which he recombined existing film clips.  In 1958 Raphael Montanez Ortiz produced ''Cowboy and Indian Film'', a seminal appropriation film work.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 1970s [[Dara Birnbaum]] was working with appropriation to produce [[feminist art|feminist works of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welchman|first1=John|title=Art After Appropriation: Essays on Art in the 1990s|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-80136-5|pages=33, 190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udVhfuujhF0C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20appropriation&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978-79 she produced one of the first video appropriations. ''[[Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman]]'' utilised video clips from the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meigh-Andrews|first1=Chris|title=A History of Video Art|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-85785-188-8|page=194|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQq5AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20technology%20transformation&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''appropriation art''''' was in common  use in the 1980s with artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]], who addressed the act of appropriating itself as a theme in art.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Levine often quotes entire works in her own work, for example photographing photographs of [[Walker Evans]]. Challenging ideas of originality, drawing attention to relations between [[power (sociology)|power]], [[gender]] and [[creativity]], [[consumerism]] and commodity value, the social sources and uses of art, Levine plays with the theme of "almost same". [[Elaine Sturtevant]] (also known simply as Sturtevant), on the other hand, painted and exhibited perfect replicas of famous works. She replicated Andy Warhol's ''Flowers'' in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. She trained to reproduce the artist's own technique—to the extent that when Warhol was repeatedly questioned on his technique, he once answered "I don't know. Ask Elaine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Ulrich Obrist|title=Elaine Sturtevant obituary|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/19/elaine-sturtevant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s [[Richard Prince]] re-photographed advertisements such as for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarette]]s or [[photo journalism|photo-journalism]] shots.  His work takes anonymous and ubiquitous cigarette billboard advertising campaigns, elevates the status and focusses our gaze on the images.

Appropriation artists comment on all aspects of culture and society. [[Joseph Kosuth]] appropriated images to engage with [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology|epistemological theory]]. Other artists working with appropriation during this time with included [[Jeff Koons]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Greg Colson]], and [[Malcolm Morley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the 1990s artists continued to produce appropriation art, using it as a medium to address theories and social issues, rather than focussing on the works themselves. [[Damian Loeb]] used film and cinema to comment on themes of [[simulacrum]] and reality. Other high-profile artists working at this time included [[Christian Marclay]], [[Deborah Kass]], [[Damien Hirst]]{{dubious|date=October 2013}} and [[Genco Gulan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://visualartbeat.com/self-portrait-by-genco-gulan/ | work=Visual Art Beat | first=Marcus | last=Graf | title=Self Portrait? by Genco Gülan | date=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the digital age ==
Since the 1990s, the exploitation of historical precursors is as multifarious as the concept of appropriation is unclear. A hitherto unparalleled quantity of appropriations pervades not only the field of the visual arts, but of all cultural areas. The new generation of appropriators considers themselves "archeolog[es] of the present time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Paolo Bianchi, quoted by Hedinger J.; Meyer, T.|title=Introduction to Whats next|url=http://whtsnxt.net/000|date=2011|publisher=Kadmos|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speak of "postproduction", which is based on pre-existing works, to re-edit "the screenplay of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourriaud|first1=Nicolas|title=Postproduction. Culture as screenplay. How art reprograms the world|date=2002|publisher=Lucas &amp; Sternberg|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation of works made by others or of available cultural products mostly follows the concept of use. So-called "prosumers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Toffler|first1=Alvin|title=The third wave. The classic study of tomorrow|date=1980|publisher=Bantam|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;—those consuming and producing at the same time—browse through the ubiquitous archive of the digital world (more seldom through the analog one), in order to sample the ever accessible images, words, and sounds via 'copy-paste' or 'drag-drop' to 'bootleg', 'mashup' or 'remix' them just as one likes. Appropriations have today become an everyday phenomenon.

The new "generation remix"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Djordjevic, V. |editor2=Dobusch, L. |title=Generation Remix|date=2014|publisher=iRights Media|url=http://irights-media.de/webbooks/generationremix/}}&lt;/ref&gt;—who have taken the stages not only of the visual arts, but also of music, literature, dance and film—causes, of course, highly controversial debates. Media scholars [[Lawrence Lessig]] coined in the begin of the 2000s here the term of the [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig's Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]] (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand are the celebrators who foresee a new age of innovative, useful, and entertaining ways for art of the digitized and globalized 21st century. The new appropriationists will not only realize Joseph Beuys' dictum that everyone is an artist but also "build free societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardy|first1=S.|title=Rip!: A Remix Manifesto|url=http://creativegeneralist.com/2009/03/rip-a-remix-manifesto/|website=Creative Generalist|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By liberating art finally from traditional concepts such as aura, originality, and genius, they will lead to new terms of understanding and defining art. More critical observers see this as the starting point of a huge problem. If creation is based on nothing more than carefree processes of finding, copying, recombining and manipulating pre-existing media, concepts, forms, names, etc. of any source, the understanding of art will shift in their sight to a trivialized, low-demanding, and regressive activity. In view of the limitation of art to references to pre-existing concepts and forms, they foresee endless recompiled and repurposed products. Skeptics call this a culture of recycling with an addiction to the past&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Retro Mania Pop Culture’s Addiction To Its Own Past|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4-dcDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that only lazy people who have nothing to say let themselves be inspired by the past in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Albini, Steve, quoted by Benjamin Franzen; Kembrew McLeod|title=Copyright Criminals|date=2009|publisher=documentary film}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others fear, that this new trend of appropriation is caused by nothing more than the wish of embellishing oneself with an attractive genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=cf. Diedrichsen|first1=Diedrich|title=Showfreaks und Monster|journal=Texte zur Kunst. Artists' Artists|date=September 2008|volume=No. 71|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''appropriationism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aden|first1=Maike|title=Let's dance like we used to....

Appropriationism is discussed—in comparison of appropriation forms and concepts of the 20th century which offer new representations of established knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aden|first1=Maike|title=Ulises Carrión Carries On!|journal=Journal of Artists' Books (JAB)|date=Summer 2016|volume=No. 40, in prep.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as a kind of "racing standstill",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Virilio|first1=Paul|title=Rasender Stillstand|date=1992|publisher=Hanser|location=München}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the acceleration of random, uncontrollable operations in highly mobilised, fluid Western societies that are governed more and more by abstract forms of control. Unlimited access to the digital archive of creations and easily feasible digital technologies, as well as the priority of fresh ideas and creative processes over a perfect masterpiece leads to a hyperactive hustle and bustle around the past instead of launching new expeditions into unexplored territory that could give visibility to the forgotten ghosts and ignored phantoms of our common myths and ideologies.

== Appropriation art and copyright ==
Appropriation art has resulted in contentious [[copyright]] issues regarding its validity under copyright law.  The U.S. has been particularly litigious in this respect. A number of [[case law|case-law]] examples have emerged that investigate the division between transformative works and [[derivative work]]s.

[[Andy Warhol]] faced a series of lawsuits from photographers whose work he appropriated and [[Screen-printing|silk-screened]]. Patricia Caulfield, one such photographer, had taken a picture of flowers for a photography demonstration for a photography magazine. Without her permission, Warhol covered the walls of [[Leo Castelli]]'s New York gallery with his silk-screened reproductions of Caulfield's photograph in 1964. After seeing a poster of Warhol's unauthorized reproductions in a bookstore, Caulfield sued Warhol for violating her rights as the copyright owner, and Warhol made a cash settlement out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_flowers.html|title=Andy Warhol's Flower Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Warhol's famous ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' are generally held to be non-infringing of the soup maker's [[trademark]], despite being clearly appropriated, because "the public was unlikely to see the painting as sponsored by the soup company or representing a competing product. Paintings and soup cans are not in themselves competing products", according to expert trademark lawyer [[Jerome Gilson]].&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;as quoted in Grant,Daniel, ''The Business of Being an Artist'' (New York: Allworth Press, 1996), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Koons]] has also confronted issues of copyright due to his appropriation work (see ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]''). Photographer Art Rogers brought suit against Koons for [[copyright infringement]] in 1989.  Koons' work, ''String of Puppies'' sculpturally reproduced Rogers' black-and-white photograph that had appeared on an airport greeting card that Koons had bought. Though he claimed [[fair use]] and [[parody]] in his defense, Koons lost the case, partially due to the tremendous success he had as an artist and the manner in which he was portrayed in the media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  The parody argument also failed, as the appeals court drew a distinction between creating a parody of modern society in general and a parody directed at a specific work, finding parody of a specific work, especially of a very obscure one, too weak to justify the fair use of the original.

In October 2006, Koons successfully defended a different work by claiming "[[fair use]]". For a seven-painting commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin, Koons drew on part of a photograph taken by [[Andrea Blanch]] titled ''Silk Sandals by Gucci'' and published in the August 2000 issue of ''Allure'' magazine to illustrate an article on metallic makeup. Koons took the image of the legs and diamond sandals from that photo (omitting other background details) and used it in his painting ''Niagara'', which also includes three other pairs of women's legs dangling surreally over a landscape of pies and cakes.

In his decision, [[Judge Louis L. Stanton]] of U.S. District Court found that ''Niagara'' was indeed a "transformative use" of Blanch's photograph. "The painting's use does not 'supersede' or duplicate the objective of the original", the judge wrote, "but uses it as raw material in a novel way to create new information, new aesthetics and new insights. Such use, whether successful or not artistically, is transformative."

The detail of Blanch's photograph used by Koons is only marginally copyrightable. Blanch has no rights to the Gucci sandals, "perhaps the most striking element of the photograph", the judge wrote. And without the sandals, only a representation of a woman's legs remains—and this was seen as  "not sufficiently original to deserve much copyright protection."
 
In 2000, [[Damien Hirst]]'s sculpture ''Hymn'' (which [[Charles Saatchi]] had bought for a reported £1m) was exhibited in ''Ant Noises'' in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over this sculpture. The subject was a 'Young Scientist Anatomy Set' belonging to his son Connor, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull (Emms) Toy Manufacturer.  Hirst  created a 20-foot, six-ton enlargement of the Science Set figure, radically changing the perception of the object. Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, [[Children Nationwide]] and the [[Toy Trust]] in an out-of-court settlement. The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first.

Appropriating a familiar object to make an art work can prevent the artist claiming copyright ownership. [[Jeff Koons]] threatened to sue a gallery under copyright, claiming that the gallery infringed his proprietary rights by selling bookends in the shape of balloon dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/04/DDRN1HIDPL.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Sam | last=Whiting | title=Jeff Koons' balloon-dog claim ends with a whimper | date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koons abandoned that claim after the gallery filed a complaint for declaratory relief stating, "As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/36786/6-hilarious-zingers-from-the-balloon-dog-freedom-suit-filed-against-jeff-koons |title=6 Hilarious Zingers From the Balloon-Dog Freedom Suit Filed Against Jeff Koons |date= January 21, 2011 |website=BlouinArtinfo |last=ALLEN |first=EMMA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, photojournalist Patrick Cariou sued artist [[Richard Prince]], [[Gagosian Gallery]] and [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli books]] for copyright infringement. Prince had appropriated 40 of Cariou's photos of [[Rastafari]] from a book, creating a series of paintings known as ''Canal Zone''. Prince variously altered the photos, painting objects, oversized hands, naked women and male torsos over the photographs, subsequently selling over $10 million worth of the works.

In September 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit questioned the Second Circuit's interpretation of the fair use doctrine in the ''Cariou'' case. Of particular note, the Seventh Circuit noted that "transformative use" is not one of the four enumerated fair use factors but is, rather, simply part of the first fair use factor which looks to the "purpose and character" of the use. The Seventh Circuit's critique lends credence to the argument that there is a split among U.S. courts as to what role "transformativeness" is to play in any fair use inquiry.&lt;ref name="proskauer.com"/&gt;

In 2013, Andrew Gilden and Timothy Greene published a law review article in The ''University of Chicago Law Review'' dissecting the factual similarities and legal differences between the ''Cariou'' case and the ''[http://www.ipinbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/salinger-opinion.pdf Salinger v. Colting]'' case, articulating concerns that judges may be creating a fair use "privilege largely reserved for the rich and famous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fair Use for the Rich and Fabulous? {{!}} The University of Chicago Law Review {{!}} The University of Chicago|url = https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/fair-use-rich-and-fabulous|website = lawreview.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Archangel Michael]]''' may be depicted in [[Christian art]] alone or with other [[angels]] such as [[Gabriel]] or saints. Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the 8th century, e.g. the stone casket at [[Mortain|Notre Dame de Mortain]] church in France.&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;  He is very often present in scenes of the [[Last Judgement]], but few other specific scenes, so most images including him are devotional rather than narrative.  The angel who rescues [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] from the "fiery furnace" in the Book of {{Bibleref2|Daniel|3|NIV|Daniel Chapter 3}} is usually regarded in Christian tradition as Michael; this is sometimes represented in [[Early Christian art]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s, but rarely in later art of the Western church. 

In most depictions Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield,&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; in the style of a Byzantine officer, which is typically found even in Western depictions, though some late-medieval ones have him in contemporary knightly armour.  Like other angels, in late-medieval Western art he may have what are known as [[feather tights]], with large feathers over most of his body, as on the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]].  He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance.&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early 4th century, when [[Emperor Constantine]] defeated [[Licinius]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 324 AD, not far from the ''[[Michaelion]]'', a church dedicated to Archangel Michael.&lt;ref name=Richard &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan, and associated him with the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:9|12:9]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine and the Christian empire'' by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 {{ISBN|0415174856}} page 315&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard [[iconography]] of Archangel Michael as a [[warrior saint]].&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

In other depictions Michael may be holding a pair of scales in which he weighs the [[souls]] of the departed and may hold the [[book of Life]] (as in the [[Book of Revelation]]), to show that he takes part in the [[Last judgment|judgment]].&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cathenc &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm |title=Catholic encyclopedia: '&amp;#39;St. Michael the Archangel'&amp;#39; |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this form of depiction is less common than the slaying of the dragon.&lt;ref name=rich141 &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 141-147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelangelo]] depicted this scene on the altar wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |title=Vatican website: Sistine Chapel |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031746/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |archivedate=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield may bears the Latin inscription ''[[Quis ut Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|087973910X}} page 520&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art]] Michael was often shown wearing the formal court robes and ''[[loros]]'' that were worn by the Emperor and his bodyguard on special occasions, rather than as a normal warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the [[Day of Judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Saints in art'' by Rosa Giorgi, Stefano Zuffi 2003 {{ISBN|0892367172}} pages 274-276&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely reproduced image of ''[[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]'', an icon of the [[Cretan school]], depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], with [[Gabriel]] on the right side of [[Madonna and Child|Mary and Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church'' by Alfredo Tradigo 2006 {{ISBN|0892368454}} page 188&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] depictions, there are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in [[Mytilene]], Archangel Michael of [[Panormitis]] and Archangel Michael of [[Nenita (Greece)|Nenita]]. Each of these icons is different.

&lt;!--More typically, he is represented as the Chief Commander of the [[Heavenly hosts]], holding a sword in one hand; in the other he often carries either a shield, a date-tree branch, a spear, or a white banner (possibly with a scarlet cross). Some icons show him holding an orb in one hand and a staff in the other. Inside the orb are often the superimposed Greek letters ΧΡ, the [[ChiRho]] symbol for Christ.

Michael is also represented in icons as standing on a horizontal body and with his left arm held high, holding a small image of a "baby". The body represents a human being at the time of his death and the image of the "baby" represents the soul of the deceased. This icon came about since the belief that the Archangel Michael takes the souls of the dead to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. This is typical of the miraculous and wonder-working Archangel Michael of Panormitis, in Symi of Greece.

In Russian iconography he is most likely to be wearing red. In many instances, Michael tramples the devil under his feet, which may be depicted as a dragon. This comes from the tradition that Michael was the main opponent of Satan in the [[War in Heaven|battle for Heaven]]. Satan, previously called Samael, was always looking to discredit [[Israelites|Israel]], while Michael was its main protector. In the end, Satan attempted to drag Michael down in his [[Fallen Angels|fall from the heights]], but Michael was rescued by God. --&gt;

'''Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger''' ({{lang-he|ברכה אטינגר, ברכה ליכטנברג-אטינגר}}) is an Israeli-born painter and theorist. As [[visual arts|visual artist]] she has mainly produced paintings, drawings, notebooks and photography. She is also a philosopher, psychoanalyst and writer.

Ettinger's work consists mostly of oil painting and writing. Ettinger is now considered to be a prominent figure among both the French painters' and the [[Culture of Israel#Fine arts|Israeli art]]'s scenes. Ettinger's art was recently analysed at length in the book ''Women Artists at the Millennium'',&lt;ref name=Millennium&gt;''Women Artists at the Millennium'', 2006, Edited by [[Carol Armstrong]] and [[Catherine de Zegher]]. {{ISBN|0-262-01226-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-262-01226-3}}.

Bracha Ettinger was born in Tel Aviv on 23 March 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://errol.oclc.org/laf/no96-32063.html Library of Congress Name Authority File]&lt;/ref&gt; She received her M.A. in [[Clinical Psychology]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] where she worked as research assistant then personal assistant of [[Amos Tversky]] (1969/70, 1973/74, 1974/75) and [[Danny Kahneman]] (1970/71).&lt;ref name="EGS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bracha Ettinger Biography |url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |website=egs.edu |publisher=The European Graduate School |accessdate=2 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905213057/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Loni Ettinger in June 1975 and moved to London where she studied, trained and worked between 1975 and 1979 at the London Centre for Psychotherapy (with Elsa Seglow), the [[Tavistock Clinic]] and the [[Philadelphia Association]] (with [[R. D. Laing]]). Her daughter the actress Lana Ettinger&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Lana Ettinger]]&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%94 %D7%90%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A8]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}} was born in London. She returned to Israel in 1979 and worked at Shalvata Hospital. Ettinger, who has painted and drawn since early childhood, is self-taught. In her early days she avoided the art scene. In 1981 she decided to become a professional artist and moved to Paris where she lived and worked from 1981 to 2003 with her partner Joav Toker. Her son Itai was born in 1988. As well as painting, drawing and photography, she began writing, and received a D.E.A. in [[Psychoanalysis]] from the [[University Paris Diderot|University Paris VII Diderot]] in 1987, and a Ph.D. in [[Aesthetics]] of Art from the [[University of Paris VIII]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt;

Ettinger had a solo project at the [[Pompidou Centre]] in 1987, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Calais in 1988. In 1995 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, and in 1996 she participated in the [[Contemporary art]] section of ''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996'' exhibition in the [[Pompidou Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996.'' Paris: Flammarion and Centre Georges Pompidou, 1996. {{ISBN|2-85850-898-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 she had a mid-life retrospective at the [[Centre for Fine Arts]] (The Palais des Beaux Arts) in Brussels, and in 2001 a solo exhibition at the [[Drawing Center]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger: Eurydice Series.'' Edited by Catherine de Zegher and Brian Massumi. ''Drawing Papers,'' n.24. NY: The Drawing Center, 2001. With texts by Judith Butler, Bracha Ettinger, Adrien Rifkin and the editors, and including a conversation between the Bracha Ettinger and Creigie Horsfield.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as working as an artist, Ettinger continued to train as psychoanalyst with [[Françoise Dolto]], Piera Auglanier, Pierre Fedida, and [[Jacques-Alain Miller]], and has become an influential contemporary [[French feminists|French feminist]].&lt;ref&gt;Couze Venn, in: ''Theory, Culture and Society''.

Even though she was still based mainly in Paris, Ettinger was visiting professor (1997–1998) and then research professor (1999–2004) in [[psychoanalysis]] and aesthetics at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt; Since 2001 she has also been visiting professor in Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics at the AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History (now CentreCATH).&lt;ref name=CATH&gt;AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cath/ahrc/people/fellows/ble.html AHRC B.Ettinger page].&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger had partly returned to Israel in 2003, and has kept studios in both Paris and Tel Aviv ever since. She was a lecturer at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem until 2006.&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt; 
Some of her specific academic fields of endeavor are [[Feminist theory#Psychoanalysis|feminist psychoanalysis]], art, [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], the [[gaze]], sexual difference and [[gender studies]], [[Jacques Lacan]], the feminine, early (including pre-birth) psychic impressions, pre-maternal and maternal subjectivity.

Ettinger's research concerns light and space, and in this it follows from [[Monet]] and [[Rothko]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Erin, Manning, Erin. "Vertiginious Before the Light." in ''Art as Compassion''.

From 1981 until 1992, Ettinger's principal artwork consisted of drawing and mixed media on paper as well as notebooks and artist's books, where alongside theoretical work and conversations she made ink and wash painting and drawing. Since 1992, apart from her notebooks, most of her artwork consists of mixed media and oil paintings, with few parallel series that spread over time like: "Matrix — Family Album", "Autistwork" and "Eurydice", with themes of generational transmission of memory, personal and historical trauma, the Shoah and the World Wars,&lt;ref&gt;[[Griselda Pollock]], Between painting and the Digital, in: ''Bracha L.

&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger has become one of the major artists of the [[New European Painting]]. Along with painting she has worked on installations, theoretical research, lectures, video works, and "encounter events". Her paintings, photos, drawings, and notebooks have been exhibited at the [[Pompidou Centre]] (1987, 1996, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ettinger|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;s=ettinger\website=centrepompidou.fr|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;–2011), and the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1997. In the last decade, Ettinger's oil on canvas paintings involve figures like Medusa, Demeter and Persephone, and Eurydice. Though from 2010 onward her work still consists mainly of oil paintings and drawings, she is also doing new media animated video-films where the images are multi-layered like her painting. In 2015, Ettinger participated in the 14th [[Istanbul Biennial]] drafted and curated by [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pavilion Istanbul in/+Leeds Part 3|url=http://www.pavilion.org.uk/events/2015/Bracha-Ettinger/|website=pavilion.org.uk|publisher=Pavilion|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalyst==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2015}}
{{Technical|section|date=April 2017}}

Ettinger is a theoretician who proposed an [[ontology]] of string-like subject-subject (trans-subjective) and subject-object (transjective) transmissivity for a rethinking of the human subject. Working at the intersections of human [[subjectivity]], [[Human female sexuality|feminine sexuality]], maternal subjectivity, [[psychoanalysis]], [[art]] and [[aesthetics]], she contributed to psychoanalysis the idea of a feminine-maternal sphere, function, and structure with its symbolic and imaginary dimensions based on femaleness in the real (womb). This dimension, as symbolic, contributes to ethical thinking about human responsibility to one another and to the world. She is a senior clinical psychologist, and a practising psychoanalyst. Her artistic practice and her articulation, since 1985, of what has become known as the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity have transformed contemporary debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and cultural studies. Ettinger was an analysand of [[Ronald Laing]] in London and [[Piera Aulagnier]] in Paris. She is member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis (TAICP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Institute|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.taicp.org.il/&amp;prev=search|website=taicp.org|publisher=TAICP|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Lacanian School (NLS) and the [[World Association of Psychoanalysis]] (AMP / WAP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapol.org/en/index.html# World Association of Psychoanalysis]&lt;/ref&gt; For Ettinger, the Freudian attitude to psychoanalysis is crucial as it emphasizes the phantasmatic value of materials that arise during regression. To Freud and Lacan she adds, however, a feminine-maternal space-time with its particular structures, functions, and dynamics in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. She claims that, in a similar way, when seduction is assigned to the paternal figure during regression, it is recognized in most cases as a result of the therapeutic process itself. It is worked-through accordingly without therapist's father-blaming, and without a resulting father-hate. Therapists must likewise realize that during regression phantasmatic maternal "not-enoughness" appears and must also be recognized as the result of the process itself, and be worked-through without the mother-hating that Ettinger considers contributes to a "psychotization" of the subject, and a block to the passage from rage to sorrow and compassion. To be able to recognize the phantasmatic status of the psychic material arising during therapy, the Lacanian concepts of Symbolic, Imaginary and Real are useful to her.

The idea of a corpo-Real is a part of her symbolization of a new feminine psychic zone (the matrixial, the womb as time space of psychic encounter-event), in both male and female subjects, and of the feminine-matrixial sexual difference. Thus, even if Ettinger critiques the Freudian and Lacanian analysis of the feminine, she considers herself as a "post" or "neo" Freudian and Lacanian, who elaborates the feminine in continuity to these psychoanalysts, but claims a supplementary feminine-maternal Eros. Ettinger criticises Winnicott and Bollas for offering patients a "ready-made mother-monster" as a cause for each psychic pain. She considers any practice of archaic-motherhood blaming as an obstacle, as "hystericizing" and even momentarily "psychoticizing" (in the sense of leading to internal splits rather than recognition of differences,) when such "cause" is brought as "explanation" by the analyst, a "cause" attributed to the unremembered early period of life where I and non-I are transconnected. Ettinger agrees with Lacan that the "ultimate" cause is in principle lacking: ''objet a''. She calls for a delicate process of differentiation, coemergence, and cofading between the generations, especially in analysing the same-sex (daughter-mother, son-father) relationships, with emphasize on transmission, not split. Thus, the process itself helps to negotiate and articulate delicately sexual difference, in the present. To the idea that the self is structured via mirror-like reflection she adds that of primal [[apperception]] of the other, through "fascinance" (aesthetic openness to the other and the cosmos), compassion and awe (affective accesses to the other) directed from the beginning to the (m)Other and the outside, not to the self.

===Psychoanalytic theory===

====Major concepts====
Ettinger invented the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply "[[The Matrixial]]", with concepts like border linking, borderspacing, martial borderspace, copoiesis, wit(h)messing and co/in-habit(u)ation.&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrixial Trans-subjectivity" in: ''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture and Society, Volum 23, Numbers 2–3, 2006.ISSN 0263-2764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Carriance, Copoiesis and the Subreal.” In: ''Saltwater. Theory of Thought Forms''. 14th Istanbul Biennial Catalogue. Edited by Carolyn Christov Bokargiev, 2015. Printed also in: Bracha L. Ettinger. A α א And My Heart Wound-Space.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger is a [[Freud]]ian and Lacanian scholar and follows the late [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Object relations theory]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]/[[Félix Guattari]].

====The early theory: from 1985 through the 1990s====
Ettinger articulated a feminine-maternal (and feminine-prematernal) dimension, space, function, Eros and dynamics in the human Unconscious. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. "I" and "non-I", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious "strings", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes ("feminine", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the 'matrixial gaze' and the process of 'co-poiesis'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first sexual difference for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminie-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection ([[Julia Kristeva]]) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant's primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordurelaint) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacant) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to "inter-subjectivity" and "self" psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is "The Matrixial Borderspace" (reprint of essays from 1994–1999) published in French in 1999&lt;ref&gt;''Regard et Espace-de-bord matrixiels''. La lettre volee. {{ISBN|2-87317-102-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 2006,&lt;ref name=Borderspace&gt;''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press 2006, edited by [[Brian Massumi]] and forwarded by [[Judith Butler]] and Griselda Pollock. {{ISBN|0-8166-3587-0}} [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/E/ettinger_matrixial.html Upress relevant page].&lt;/ref&gt; but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005–2006.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly: "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility", "Fascinance" and "Com-passionate Co-response-ability, Initiation in Jointness, and the link x of Matrixial Virtuality". All published in 2006 — see list of recent publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The theory in the 2000s====
Her more recent artistic and theoretical work centers around the spiritual in art and ethics. In the domain of psychoanalysis, around the question of same-sex differences, the primary feminine difference is the difference opened between woman (girl) and woman (m/Other), maternal subjectivity, maternal/pregnance Eros of com-passion, the effects of compassion and awe and the passion for borderlinking and borderspacing&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Diotima and the Matrixial Transference: Psychoanalytical Encounter-Event as Pregnancy in Beauty." In: Van der Merwe, Chris N., and Viljoen, Hein, eds. Across the Threshold: Explorations of Liminality in Literature. New York: Peter Lang &amp; Potchefstroom: Literator, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4331-0002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that three kinds of fantasy (that she names Mother-fantasies) should be recognized, when they appear in a state of regression aroused by therapy itself, as primal: Mother-fantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment. Their mis-recognition in psychoanalysis (and analytical therapy), together with the ignorance of maternal Eros of com-passion leads to catastrophic blows to the matrixial daughter-mother tissue and hurts the maternal potentiality of the daughter herself, in the sense that attacking the "non-I" is always also attacking the "I" that dwells inside an "I"-and-"non-I" trans-subjective matrixial (feminine-maternal) tissue. Contributing to Self psychoanalysis after [[Heinz Kohut]], Ettinger articulated the difference between com-passionate borderlinking, compassion (as affect) and empathy, and between "empathy without compassion" and "empathy within compassion", claiming that the analyst's empathy without compassion harms the matrixial psychic tissue of the analysand, while empathy within compassion leads to creativity and to the broadening of the ethical horizon. Ettinger explains how by empathy (toward the patient's complaints) ''without'' compassion (toward the patient's surrounding past and present family figures, no less than toward the patient itself), the therapist "produces" the patient's real mother as a "ready-made monster-mother" figure, that serves to absorb complaints of all kinds, and thus, a dangerous splitting is induced between the "good" mother figure (the therapist) and a "bad" mother figure (the real mother). This splitting is destructive in both internal and external terms, and mainly for the daughter-mother relations, since the I and non-I are in any case always trans-connected, and therefore any split and projected hate (toward such figures) will turn into a self-hate in the woman/daughter web. Such a concept of subjectivity, where "non-I" is trans-connected to the "I", has deep ethical implications&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility: Besideness, and the three Primal Mother-Phantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment". In: ''Athena: Philosophical Studies''. Vol. 2 (Vilnius: Versus). 2006. 100–135. ISSN 1822-5047.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as far-reaching sociological and political implications that have been further developed by [[Griselda Pollock]] in order to rethink [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern art]] and History. Ettinger's recent theoretical proposals starting around 2008 include the three Shocks of maternality and the paternal infnticide impulses (Laius Complex)&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7910">'''Chickenshed''' (also known as '''Chicken Shed''' or the '''Chicken Shed Theatre Company''') is a [[Great Britain|British]] [[theatre]] company based in [[Southgate, London]].

Chickenshed’s membership programme comprises four Children’s theatre groups and two Youth theatre groups for young people aged 5–21 years.  They run Saturday and holiday workshops for ages 5–12 years and performance and singing workshops for adults. They also operate education courses in inclusive performing arts at BTEC, Foundation Degree and BA (Hons) Levels.

Chickenshed was founded by teacher Mary Ward and singer/composer Jo Collins in 1974. It began in a disused chicken barn  in Barnet, which is how it came to be called Chickenshed. Mary Ward started teaching in 1966 and was struck by how much better the children she taught could be reached through drama than any other subject and those who struggled in other fields shone in an environment where the work was created to fit those taking part rather than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.chickenshed.org.uk/ambassador-and-guardian#sthash.93KHHxh4.dpuf |title=Ambassador and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chickenshed has a purpose built theatre complex in Southgate. The theatre has four performance spaces: The Rayne Theatre which seating 300, a smaller Studio Theatre, and Amphitheatre and a Bar/restaurant that regularly hosts music and comedy evenings. They also have a branch in Kensington and Chelsea. Since 2000, Chickenshed has established 19 'Sheds' in the UK and two in Russia. These Sheds have been set up and trained by Chickenshed but then go to run independently, linked to Chickenshed by a shared vision of inclusive practice and philosophy. We are always looking for organisations or consortiums of organisations to work with us to establish new 'Sheds' / inclusive community theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chickenshed.org.uk/outreach/set_up_a_shed | publisher=ChickenShed | accessdate=2007-09-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929071223/http://www.chickenshed.org.uk/outreach/set_up_a_shed | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chickenshed is registered as a [[Charitable organization|charity]] under the name The Chickenshed Theatre Trust. In 1996, company founder Mary Ward was awarded the MBE for Services to the Arts followed in 1999, with a Creative Britons Award, to acknowledge her 25 years of work with the theatre,&lt;ref name="Creative Britons Award"&gt;{{cite news

Chickenshed appointed Lou Stein as its artistic director on 4 April 2016.

==Music==
The first musical writers for Chickenshed were Jo Collins and Anthony Filby, who together formed Colby music, through which they published a collection of musicals that Chickenshed performed. The music team has since greatly expanded.
In December 1997, Chickenshed released a single, entitled "I Am In Love With The World", performed by children from the theatre.  At [[bookmaker]]'s [[odds]] of 4/1, the song was one of the contenders to become the UK [[Christmas number-one single]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Diana had been the royal patron of the theatre along with Dame [[Judi Dench]], who is also a great supporter, and it was one of her favorite charities.&lt;ref name="Creative Britons Award"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Our History | url=http://www.chickenshed.org.uk/about/history | publisher=ChickenShed | accessdate=2007-09-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929071230/http://www.chickenshed.org.uk/about/history | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2003 saw the release of ''The Chicken Shed Album'', a compilation that marked the 30th anniversary of the theatre company. Contributors to the album included supporters of the organisation, such as [[Cliff Richard]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Bob Hoskins]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]], as well as three tracks by Chicken Shed itself. Jo Collins &amp; Chickenshed recorded a song, "Talk Through Me" for the 2007 [[show tunes]] album ''[[Over the Rainbow (2007 album)|Over the Rainbow]]'', in aid of [http://www.childhospice.co.uk The Association of Children's Hospices].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">'''Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis''', known as '''CARLA''', was a proprietary software program developed by the architectural firm Willis &amp; Associates of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1971.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:CARLA brochure 01.tif|thumb|right|CARLA Brochure]]
[[File:CARLA brochure 02.tif|thumb|right|CARLA Brochure]]
In the 1970s, there were not many architectural and engineering firms that recognized the computer’s potential as a tool for financial evaluation. [[Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills]], a firm in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], produced managing [[software]] designed to organize an array of financials that could help identify a successful development investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Economic Probes, Key to Developer’s Success, enhanced by Computers from Building Design and Construction|journal=The Magazine of Commercial and Industrial Building|date=June 1972|publisher=A Cahner’s Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; This application was limited to financial analysis and marked the first phase of computer application in [[architecture]]. In 1971, Willis and Associates innovated the computer’s spatial analysis capacities for application in architectural and [[land-use planning|land planning]] practices, foreshadowing the eventual development of [[computer-aided design]] and mapping programs in architecture and urban planning. CARLA was able to produce in a twenty-day period what by traditional methods and analyses would achieve in four to six months, allowing land development and construction to take place more rapidly. This was an important consideration in the 1970s when rates of inflation were rising and construction delays could introduce significant cost increases.  CARLA could process “500% more information in 400% less time and at 40% of the cost generated by utilizing the more traditional methods.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff Writer|title=Computer Moves into Land Studies|publisher=S.F., Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle|date=September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software Development==
[[File:058 CARLA computer room.jpg|thumb|left|CARLA Computer Room]]
CARLA was a customized software program conceived by [[Beverly Willis]] and written in house by a [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] student, Jochen Eigen, designed to analyze prospective land parcels for their development potential as large-scale multi-unit complexes. Jochen Eigen wrote the programming scripts that directed CARLA as the managing software to interface a variety of planning unit concepts with a mapping program that could then process a variety of planning proposals against the site’s fixed fields of relevant data. The data was extracted from traditional analog topographical maps soil analysis, and marketing information.

Once the physical characteristics were entered into CARLA, the computer could generate contour perspectives of the site from any point plotted along an x, y, x axis and help identify areas of common building suitability, natural drainage patterns slope analysis and areas requiring cut and fill. Using the CARLA grid as a structural template, multiple planning unit concepts were introduced and profiled against the site’s fixed characteristics and CARLA would then determine what plan, how many building units and of what variety could be successfully integrated into designated areas within the site.  These tests were repeated until a match that produced environmentally and economically sound results was identified.

The computer graphic information reports were represented either in the form of topographical site perspectives, contour maps or as a sequence of numeric values organized within a template matrix that allowed the architect to identify the optimal relationships and planning concept. This work then became the basis for presentation materials that were used to introduce the client/developer to the proposed designs.

==Selected Projects==

===IRS Computer Center Building (unbuilt)===
In 1976, Willis &amp; Associates was awarded a federal building commission from the General Services Administration (GSA) in [[Washington, D.C.]], representing the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and administered by the GSA office in [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].  The project was conceived by the IRS as a prototype design that would be site-adapted for nine subsequent buildings in IRS regions across the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=John|title=Beverly Willis Oral History Project|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/beverlywillis/|website=The Bancroft Library|publisher=Regional Oral History Office|accessdate=11 October 2015|location=University of California, Berkeley|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Computer Center Building was part of an $800 million dollar program to automate tax returns at tax processing campuses servicing different IRS regions nationwide. Willis &amp; Associates’ program CARLA provided the technical knowledge required for the IRS Computer Center Building.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Aliamanu Valley Community for Military Family Housing (1978)===

In 1974, Willis &amp; Associates, Inc., was awarded an architectural and engineering contract for the design and plan of the Aliamanu Valley Community for Military Housing in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The project was a $110 million complex of 11,500 inhabitants, residing in 525 buildings on a 524-acre site. It was the first joint family housing venture in Hawaii.  The community consisted of an Army-Navy complex of 2,600 family apartments: 1,600 Army apartments, 800 Navy apartments, and 200 for the Marine Corps.

Though CARLA had been previously used in designing multi-housing complexes on challenging sites, the Aliamanu site presented a greater challenge due to a non-active volcanic crater floor in a one hundred year old flood plain of clay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=David J.|title=A-E Computerized Path to Large-Scale Housing|journal=Engineering News Record|date=November 1976|pages=Cover Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental to the development of an economical land-use plan for Aliamanu was the firm’s belief that the “best site plans are those that least disturb the land, that preserve the natural drainage channels and minimize need to cut and fill.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Land planning decisions were based on the principle−Less construction means less destruction. CARLA’s analyses allowed for less earth-moving for the project, causing less destruction to the environment and lowering overall construction costs.

In a [[non-fiction]] [[book]], a '''conclusion''' is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing.  This generally follows the body or perhaps an [[afterword]], and the conclusion may be followed by an [[epilogue]], [[outro (book)|outro]], [[postscript]], appendix/[[Addendum#In books|addendum]], [[glossary]], [[bibliography]], [[index (publishing)|index]], [[erratum|errata]], or a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. [[Aristotle]], in ''The Rhetoric'', tells us a good writer should do this in the conclusion: "make the audience well-disposed towards ourselves and ill-disposed to our opponent." It's a good opportunity to make inferences or predictions, or to ask the audience to consider what would happen if they do not accept our point of view by making a connection to society in general.

'''''Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer''''' is an [[advertisement|announcement trailer]] for the 2011 video game ''[[Dead Island]]'', which was developed by [[Techland]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by [[Giles Lamb]].

The trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.

==Plot==
The story is presented in [[Reverse chronology|reverse chronological order]] and in [[slow motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/03/23/dead-island-there-is-an-apocalypse-happening/|title=Dead Island: "There is an apocalypse happening"|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|work=[[VG247]]|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/dead-island-cgi-trailer/2300-6299756/|title=Dead Island CGI Trailer|first=Dan|last= Mihoerck |date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected [[zombie outbreak]] occurs.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.

The father opens the door and picks up a [[fire axe]] to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck.  To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5837416/the-final-moments-of-that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-discovered-in-the-game|title=The Final Moments of That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family Discovered in the Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''[[Dead Island]]'', originally announced in 2007 by Techland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/08/dead-island-details-rescued|title=Dead Island Details Rescued|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2007|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[survival horror]] video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5775798/that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-theyre-not-in-the-game|title=That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family? They're Not In The Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=April 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, [[Deep Silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/coj-dev-still-working-on-dead-island|title=COJ dev still working on Dead Island |first=Ellie|last=Gibson|date=June 7, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/dead-island-trailer-shows-the-worst-vacation-ever/|title=Dead Island Trailer Shows The Worst Vacation Ever|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=February 16, 2011|first=Ryan|last=Fleming|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/02/16/welcome-to-dead-island|title=Welcome to Dead Island|first=Ryan|last=Geddes|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer was produced and made by the [[Glasgow]]-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for ''[[Killzone 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/dead-island-trailer-creators-revealed/0108748|title=Dead Island trailer creators revealed|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, [[Deep Silver]] gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists.&lt;ref name="Line"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/37118-dead-island/|title=Dead Island: The game behind the stunning trailer, developed by Axis Animation and Savalas, is finally ready for release|first=Henry|last=Northmore|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel [[non-linear]] and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room.&lt;ref name="G4TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/710713/dead-island-the-making-of-an-amazing-video-game-trailer/|title=Dead Island: The Making Of An Amazing Video Game Trailer|first=Anthony|last=Hernandez|work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the "discovery" of the outbreak, its inevitability,&lt;ref name="Dev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/how-we-made-the-gore-ballet-dead-island-trailer/0116981|title=How we made the 'gore ballet' Dead Island trailer|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|first=Rob|last=Crossley|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109577-Dead-Island-Publisher-Shares-Its-Trailer-Making-Secrets|title=Dead Island Publisher Shares Its Trailer-Making Secrets|first=Logan|last=Westbrook|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in [[slow motion]], as they believed that it could make the action feel "balletic" instead of purely violent.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The trailer is made up of [[computer imagery]], and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of ''Dead Island''.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of "artwork", stating influence from the ''Carousel'' trailer from [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Escapist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_303/8817-The-Ballet-of-Death|first=Robert|last=Rath|title=Rise From Your Grave: The Ballet Of Death|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was also designed to showcase "great zombie moments" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/07/paradise-lost-how-dead-island-hopes-to-live-up-to-emotional-trailer/|title=How Dead Island hopes to live up to emotional trailer|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer's music was composed by [[Giles Lamb]], who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be "somber", "melancholy", and "elegant",&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a "juxtaposition between beauty and horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/25/dead-island-cinematic-designer-responds-to-mixed-trailer-reactions.aspx|title=Dead Island Cinematic Designer Responds To Mixed Trailer Reactions|first=Annette|last=Gonzalez|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3537988/dead-island-the-reckoning|title=Dead Island: The Reckoning|first=Russ|last=Pitts|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/02/dead-island-release-trailer/|title=How a viral trailer set up Dead Island as a triple-A game release next week|first=Matthew|last=Lynley|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through [[YouTube]], exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; ''Dead Island'' also became one of the most searched items on [[Google]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]] for several days.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; Following the trailer's release, ''Dead Island'' became a widely anticipated game.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

Many critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared it favorably to [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/17/dead-island-trailer-controversial|title=Dead Island: Will It Be The Most Controversial Trailer Ever Made|first=Keith|last=Sturat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fahey from ''[[Kotaku]]'' called the trailer's use of the dead girl "heartbreaking" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game.&lt;ref name="Kok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5762287/dead-island-returns-and-a-little-girl-dies|title=The Most Heartbreaking Zombie Video Game Trailer You'll Ever See|first=Mike|last=Fahey|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its graphics and pacing also received commendation.&lt;ref name="Reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-problem-with-game-trailers/1100-6365663/|title=The Problem With Game Trailers|first=Laura|last= Parker |date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse.&lt;ref name="reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/09/dead-islands-trailer-was-amazing-appalling-and-enlightening/|title=Dead Island's Trailer Was Amazing, Appalling And Enlightening|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Schreier from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/02/dead-island-trailer/|title=Don't Get Caught Up In Dead Island Trailer Hype|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually "shy away from", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; Ben Parfitt from ''[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]'' found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/opinion-that-dead-island-trailer/04843|title=OPINION: That Dead Island trailer|first=Ben|last=Parfitt|work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dead-island-trailer-creator-speaks-to-dead-girl-controversy/|title=Dead Island trailer creator speaks to dead girl controversy|first=Matt|last=Bradford|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rath from ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' also liked the segment, calling it "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.&lt;ref name="Escapist"/&gt;

The lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer.&lt;ref name="Reception"/&gt; Daemon Hatfield from [[IGN]] similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/04/gdc-is-dead-island-anything-like-its-debut-trailer|title=GDC: Is Dead Island Anything Like Its Debut Trailer|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.&lt;ref name="reception"/&gt;

The trailer was given a gold award at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/dead-island-trailer-wins-gold-award-at-cannes-advertising-fe/|title=Dead Island trailer wins Gold award at Cannes ... advertising festival|first=Christopher|last=Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/ten_of_the_best_cgi_game_trailers.html|title=Ten of the Best CGI Game Trailers|work=VideoGamer.com|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-best-game-trailers-of-the-generation-1462534128|title=The Best Game Trailers Of The Generation|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/the-14-best-game-trailers-of-2014|title=The 14 Best Game Trailers Of 2014|first=Marty|last=Silva|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
A live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/3/5061620/dead-island-trailer-live-action-remake|title=Watch the gloriously gory 'Dead Island' trailer re-enacted in live action|first=Vlad|last=Savov  |date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/02/17/dead-island-trailer-re-cut-in-chronological-order.aspx|title=Dead Island Trailer Re-Cut In Chronological Order|first=Matt|last=Helgeson|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; The announcement trailer for ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'', released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_island_riptide/b/xbox360/archive/2012/09/18/another-gorgeous-depressing-cg-trailer.aspx|title=Dead Island Riptide: Another Gorgeous, Depressing CG Trailer|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer for ''[[Goat Simulator]]'' in 2014 also mimicked the format of the ''Dead Island'' announcement trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/goat-simulator-pulls-a-dead-island-for-its-emotional-launch-trailer-272493.phtml|title=Goat Simulator pulls a Dead Island for its emotional launch trailer|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by [[Lionsgate]], though the project was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/1/5960827/dead-island-movie-deep-silver|title=Hollywood taking a second stab at a Dead Island movie|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 1, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of ''[[Dead Island: Definitive Edition]]'' in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/heres-a-musical-tribute-to-the-dead-island-trailer-in-case-you-wanted-to-cry-today/?|title=Here's a musical tribute to the Dead Island trailer, in case you wanted to cry today|first=Sam|last=Prett|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endless Night K83.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Endless Night'', oil on canvas, 2.25 X 3 meters (7.5 X 10 feet), 1983]]

'''''Endless Night''''' is the title of a [[painting]] executed in 1983 by [[Nabil Kanso]] in [[Oil painting|oil paint]] on [[canvas]] measuring 2.25 X 3 meters (7.5 X 10 feet).&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: Paintings 1974-94'', p.69, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a group of interrelated paintings made by Kanso in response to the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine, ''Artist Inspired by War-Torn Homeland,'' The Atlanta Journal – The Atlanta Constitution, p. 5 H, July 8, 1984, online [http://lebanonpainting.com/fox.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, I: ''Nabil Kanso Work'', Panorama, April 10, 1985, Maracaibo, article  [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/panorama.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the ravages war in a scene that “embodies recurrent themes of carnage, suffering and the disintegration of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Artist Inspired by War,'' The Atlanta Journal, p.5H&lt;/ref&gt; 

The composition seems to divide the canvas in two zones that contrast one mass of helpless and tormented figures on the left and one group of complacent looking and rigidly poised figures on the upper right. The focal point appears to fall between the two contrasting sections toward the central horizontal line in the middle distance creating a variation of focus that moves from one side to another and spread the attention over the various areas.&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: Paintings 1980-83'', Catalog, p. 19, Atlanta, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The swirls of somber tone emanating from the blaze of torched places in the background seem to reinforce the tense mood and sharpen the interplay of dark and light.&lt;ref&gt;Fuenmayor, Carlos, Space Cries, Time Cries, La Columna, pp.8-9, May 21, 1987, Maracaibo, article [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/fuenmayor.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Critical opinion notes “A dark palette tending to brown is set afire by strongly contrasting hues. A lurid orange illuminates the ''Endless Night'', in which figures with masklike faces standing on a parapet stonily witness the suffering of people and animals below.”&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine, ''The Political Show'', Atlanta Journal – Constitution, p. 3H, June 24, 1984, [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/ajc684.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19565">'''Endre Tot''' (Endre TÓT) born in [[Sümeg]], [[Hungary]],1937 is a Hungarian artist who lives and works in [[Cologne]], Germany.

Tot participated in the [[Fluxus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-vautier.com/2007/2007.php3?id_sujet=flux fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; movement and is well known for his [[Mail art]] projects, the use of xerox copies and usage of rubber stamps with clear [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] text declarations. In some of them Tot declares: "We are glad if we are happy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hundertmark-gallery.com/artist-endre-tot.0.html Endré Tot]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he shows "Who's Afraid of Nothing? Absent images" at [[Museum Ludwig]], Cologne, a continuation of a project called "Nothing is not nothing".

==The 60s – Experiments in Informel==
He studied at the Mural Department of the Hungarian College of Arts and Crafts from 1959 till 1965. He started to make informel paintings, an absolute novelty in Hungary, in the early 60s followed shortly by collages and works executed in the spirit of Pop Art and Minimal Art. He became attached in the mid-60s to a leading but neglected Avant-Garde painter, Dezső Korniss who highly appreciated his pioneering informel ventures. In 1968 and 1969 he joined his young Neo-Avant-Garde colleagues named collectively the Iparterv Group of Artists at two scandalous exhibitions heavily criticised by officialdom. A retrospective of his early works was staged at the Budapest Kiscelli Museum in 1989, his early pencil and ink drawings were shown at Székesfehérvár’s King Stephen Museum in 2003, while a comprehensive exhibition of his early works entitled „Early Works – from painted to unpainted pictures” at the Szombathely Gallery in 2004 presented most of his important works executed before his „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970). After the political turn of 1989-1990 many of his major works executed back in the 60s were acquired by important Hungarian museums.

==The 70s – The Beginnings of Concept Art==
In 1970-71 he broke radically with painting and has since been pre-occupied with Concept Art. „Tót may well have possessed the most phenomenal painter talent among artists living East of Amsterdam. And yet, he voluntarily relinquished painting for the sake of a truth that he had gradually recognised to be even more important than painting.” (Géza Perneczky, writing in Új Művészet, October, 2003) As a farewell to his painter period he prepared his artist’s book „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970), a virtual presentation of his canvasses never actually accomplished. Also in the early 70s, he evolved some of his basic ideas like "Nothing/Zer0", "Rains and Gladnesses" that were to permeate his works in subsequent decades.
The new media he employed in his art include telegrams, picture postcards, T-shirts, Xerox copies, typewriters, films, music, posters, graffiti, banners, actions, artist’s books, street newsreels.
Critics recognised his early „Absent Works” published by Cologne-based DuMont Verlag ("Aktuelle Kunst in Ost-Europa", 1972) to be the very first conceptual works stemming from Eastern-Europe, works that were to be greatly enhanced in subsequent decades. Some other conceptual works of his were also published in Achille Bonito Oliva’s „Europe/America: The Different Avant-Garde” (Milan, 1976).
„He entered the stage of mail art almost in the very first hour”, wrote J. M. Poison in his catalogue of 1971 entitled „Mail Art-Communication - A Distance-Concept”. His fellow mail art correspondents included his later friend Ben Vautier, John Armleder, George Brecht, Daniel Spoerri, Cosey Fanny Tutti, Genesis P-Orridge, Dieter Roth, Marina Abramovich, Ken Friedmann and his dog. His mail art was exhibited at the Paris Bi-Annual of 1972 together with art by such other mail art pioneers as Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Richard Johnson, Ben Vautier, George Brecht. About his letters written with a zero code Pierre Restany, a friend of Yves Klein’s, wrote this in 1978: „In the immaterial zone of a concentrated (ZEROED) sensitivity Endre Tót appears to be the Yves Klein of mail art, a monochrome of postage.”
His first museum exhibition was staged by the Israel Museum in 1975. Since Hungary had severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967, Tót was forced to smuggle his works out of Hungary in an adventurous way. His conceptual works (e.g. his Rainproof-ideas) executed between 1970 and 1974 were exhibited there simultaneously with Alberto Giacometti’s statues. Art magazines in Germany, Italy, and France took note of the exhibition with the Jerusalem Post commenting: "This is not to say that Endre Tot is the same race with Giacometti, but he is a totally new and rewarding experience."
In 1974, the Swiss Howeg Verlag published his sheet of stamps called Zero-Post among the very first artist’s stamps of international mail art.
At the invitation of John Armleder, his later friend who became world-famous for his Neo Geo movement, he spent half a year with the Ecart Gallery of Geneva, an institution also functioning as a mail art centre. It was during his stay in Geneva that he accomplished his first street action (TOTalJoys 1976) which was filmed and later issued on DVD by the Paris Bureau des Videos in 2005.
His artist’s books made in Budapest in the 70s earned him quite a lot of international praise. He had first published them on a samizdat basis but they were later republished by Western-European Avant-Garde publishers. 1971: „My Unpainted Canvasses”,  „The States of Zeros”, „Semmi sem semmi / Nothing ain't Nothing”, 1972: „Nothing”, „Incomplete Informations”, 1974: „Zero-Texts (1971-72)”, „Night Visit to the National Gallery” (Beau Geste Press, UK), „Zero-Post”, „Rainproof Ideas (1971-74)”, 1979: ”TÓTalJOYS”, 1981: ”Very Special Drawings”, 1990: „Evergreen Book”. In 1998, the Paris Bibliothèque Nationale bought several of his artist’s books. The library of the Paris Pompidou Centre acquired his Correspondence avec John Armleder (Ecart, Geneva, 1974) in 2010. His artist’s books were exhibited in many European, American and Canadian museums including the Pompidou Centre’s „Livres d'Artistes” exhibition of 1985.
He was still a resident of Budapest when, in 1977, he exhibited with Galerie Bama, one of the best-known Paris galleries. His show was reviewed in L 'Express by Otto Hahn. Due to his international actions and mail art activities he counted in the West as one of the most notable Eastern-European artists, an appraisal hardly acknowledged in his native country.
He was plucked from the isolation of his Óbuda apartment in the late 70s by an invitation coming from the Berlin Artist Program of DAAD. His applications for an exit permit had been refused by the authorities several times which created a political sensation in the Western press, a circumstance that eventually earned him a permit. After staying in Berlin for a year Tót opted for emigration. His Óbuda apartment was confiscated but his sibling had evacuated his works stored there in the nick of time. After being stored in various low-key places, they were eventually deposited with the Hungarian National Gallery in an orderly fashion.
It was in West-Berlin that Tót came to realise the ideas that he had taken with him in his suitcase and in his mind from Budapest. Shortly after arriving, he placed the following inscription upon the Berlin Wall: „Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ich etwas auf die andere Seite der Mauer schreiben dürfte” (I should be glad if I were allowed to write something on the other side of this wall). He demonstrated his joys ("TÓTalJOYs") with posters in his hand or upon his back in the busiest spots of the metropolis. He even placed a flickering sentence speaking about his joy among the news items of a street newsreel atop a Kurfürstendamm building. In 1978 DAAD filmed and published in book form his street action named TOTalJOYS. He twice exhibited his works with Galerie René Block, an institution previously hosting such notables as Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell. The irony inherent in his actions and mail art definitely links him up with the fluxus movement in Germany. He was the sole Eastern-European protagonist of the itinerant exhibition organised by René Block entitled „Fluxus in Germany 1962-1992”.

==The 80s – Blackout in Cologne==
After a stay of one and a half years in Berlin he moved to Cologne with his German wife Herta. The first years of his Cologne period were much less productive than his stay in Berlin. He hardly ever worked until the mid-80s. Invited by Artist Place, he flew to New York City in 1982 with a piece of chalk in his pocket that he used for placing graffiti on the walls of the gallery. It was here that he met up with a great number of notable artists including Alan Kaprow and his friend of old, John Armleder.
With the „blackout years” gone, as he himself called them, he started to work again feverishly from the late 80s on. He elaborated on the idea of „absent paintings”, an idea dating back to his Budapest years (My Unpainted Canvasses, 1970, Night Visit to the National Gallery, A Visit to the Museum,  both in 1974). With his „absent paintings” he accomplished a virtual return to painting but this was tantamount in his case to its final destruction. The spirit nurturing his Blackout and Catalogued paintings comes from an aesthetics of dearth[1] . Conceived in an aesthetics of disappearance, his „absent” works attempt to visualise nothing and void itself. His large work entitled „Dada Messe in Berlin” was exhibited at the show ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art (ZKM, Karlsruhe, 2002) presenting major iconoclastic works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Duchamp, Malevich, Picabia, Warhol, Beuys etc. At the Bremen exhibition „Who Killed the Painting?” (Museum für Moderne Kunst, 2010) his large triptych „Fluxus Triptichon” (2002, 3 x 200 x 125&amp;nbsp;cm) was on view alongside works by Beuys, Kaprow, Ben Vautier, G. Brecht, Al Hausen, Nam June Paik etc.

==The 90s – Retrospectives and Entering the Canon==
After the political change of 1989-1990 in Hungary Tót returned to his native country with his works created abroad. He filled all 12 exhibiting halls of the Palace of the Arts with them under the evocative title of „Nothing is Nothing”. Four years later he exhibited with the Cologne Ludwig Museum (Who is afraid of Nothing?), and this selection of his works was re-exhibited with the Budapest branch of the Ludwig Museum in 1999. Tót is the first Hungarian artist to have been asked to put on an individual show at the Kassel Documenta. Curators there insisted on using the Hungarian title of his Budapest show (Semmi sem semmi) probably because they liked its exotic sound. His action on the city’s main square involving him distributing flyers with a black mask hiding his face was cut short by the police even though the flyers contained no information at all. Along with his works accomplished in his studio, his street actions have also helped him achieve international fame. 
„I am glad that I have stood here” – this was inscribed in Hungarian on his bronze plaque placed in the pavement in 1998 in front of [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool's]] art space in Budapest (60, Paulay Ede St.). Six years later a similarly inscribed plaque („Ich freue mich, dass ich hier gestanden habe”) was placed in the floor of the roof terrace of the Cologne Ludwig Museum. 
His Flyer, Zero, Joy etc. street actions as satellite events to international exhibitions have embarrassed or enraged passers-by in many cities over the decades, not infrequently causing even the police to intervene. International critics usually evaluate those anti-demonstrations by Tót to be responses to the mandatory political demonstrations that he had lived through as a young man in totalitarian Hungary.

==The 2000s==
A photo documentation of Tót’s earliest street action was exhibited at the international show „Protest &amp; Survive” put on by the famous London Whitechapel Gallery. Requested by the curators, he also re-staged his remarkable Geneva street action. The catalogue said this about his actions: „Tót's response to the censorship, isolation and suppression inherent in a totalitarian state was to produce his series of joy”. At the exhibition staged by the Vienna Kunstforum entitled „Superstars von Warhol bis Madonna” (2005) his conceptual paperwork „depicting” or rather just marking Mona Lisa’s (absent) smile was on view alongside Duchamps’ famous moustached Mona Lisa. 
The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had acquired several works of his created during his Budapest isolation and exhibited them in 2006 at its show „Eye on Europe – 1960 to Now”. Along with Czech artist Milan Knizak, Tót was the only exhibiting artist coming from Eastern Europe. Two years later MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry presented an Honorary Artist Membership to him.

==The 2010s – Tót in Collections==
In 2010 he exhibited with such wide-ranging institutions as Neues Museum Nürnberg, Museum für Moderne Kunst Wesenburg - Bremen, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, The V. Koc Foundation Contemporary Art Collection Istanbul. The Pompidou Centre’s catalogue published a copy of his 1975 letter to Pierre Restany ending with the words: „So I'm fucked with my zer0000000000000s”. Simultaneously, the Paris Hungarian Institute staged a show of the Iparterv Group of Artists (Le Progrés de l'Illusion), where Tót’s early (1966/67) informel paintings and paperworks were also on view.
His conceptual works were acquired from 1975 through 2010 by such major collections as those of MoMA New York, Getty Museum Los Angeles, Museum Ludwig Köln, Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, Israel Museum Jerusalem, Haags Gemeentemuseum The Hague, and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts as well as East-Central European museums like National Gallery Prague, Museum Stuki Łódź, Museum of Modern Art Ljubjana, National Gallery of Art Varsaw, Museum of Modern Art Olmütz, Hungarian National Gallery, Ludwig Museum Budapest, or even two museums in Latin-America: the Center de Arte y Communication (CAYC) Buenos Aires, and the Museu de Arte Contemporaneu da Universidade de São Paulo. 
Probably more than a hundred of his major works are preserved in such notable private collections as Sammlung Dr. Speck (Cologne), Sammlung René Block (Berlin), Das Archive Sohm (Stuttgart), The Sacker Archive of Concrete und Visual Poetry (Miami Beach, Florida).
In 2009 he published a memoir entitled „I’m glad that I can write one sentence after another” with Noran Publishers, Budapest. A critic wrote this about the book: „This is half-way between a logbook and an autonomous work of art since the primacy of the text is questioned throughout by its unusual layout and illustrations… The account Tót gives of his youthful love-affair is deeply moving, the way he recalls the relationship of the regime towards its artists in the 60s and 70s, convincing, and the list of his fleeting affairs with girls is very funny.”
Due to the extreme multiplicity of Tót’s oeuvre, it is next to impossible to understand his art without a thorough-going theoretical back-up.

The '''''Fuente del Ángel Caído''''' (''Fountain of the Fallen Angel'' or ''Monument of the Fallen Angel'') is a [[fountain]] located in the [[Buen Retiro Park]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. {{coord|40.411053|-3.682535|display=title}}

The statue that crowns the monument is the masterpiece of [[Ricardo Bellver]] who realized it in plaster in 1877 while a 3rd year pensioner in [[Rome]], inspired by verses from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' of [[John Milton]] (Canto I).&lt;ref name="elprado"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/angel-caido-el-bellver/|title=Ángel caído, El [Bellver]
|website=www.museodelprado.es|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted it to the 1877 edition of the ''[[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|Exposiciones Nacionales de Bellas Artes]]'' where it received the first prize.&lt;ref&gt;''Catálogo de la Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes'', Madrid, 1878, págs. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The state acquired the work and presented it to the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]. Since only works in [[marble]] and [[bronze]] were accepted, the statue was cast in bronze at this occasion and the plaster original destroyed.

The statue returned to Spain in what was then the ''Museo Nacional de Pintura y Escultura'' (also known as the ''Museo de la Trinidad'', now part of the [[Museo del Prado]]). The director of the museum, Benito Soriano Murillo, proposed its relocation in the open space so that the public could freely enjoy this peculiar and unusual creation. The statue was passed to the city hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/madrid-enjoys-the-devil-of-a-row-over-a-fallen-angel-1157515.html|title=Madrid enjoys the devil of a row over a fallen angel|date=27 May 1998|website=www.independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2013|location=London|first=Elizabeth|last=Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt; that placed it on the spot of its present location which was formerly occupied by the [[Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro|Real Fábrica de Porcelanas de la China]] before its destruction during the [[Peninsular War|French invasion]] in 1813, at the intersection of the ''paseo de Cuba'', the ''paseo de Uruguay'' and the ''paseo del Duque de Fernán Nuñez'' in the Retiro park. The [[duque de Fernán Nuñez]] (probably Manuel Falcó y d´Adda y Valcárcel, the husband of the III Duquesa de Fernán Núñez)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madridvillaycorte.es/palacio-fernan-nunez.php|title=Palacio de Fernán Nuñez|website=www.madridvillaycorte.es|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored the monument. The architect [[Francisco Jareño]] was charged to design the pedestal, that is octagonal with figures of devils on each side gripping fishes, lizards and snakes, and placed at the center of a fountain of 10&amp;nbsp;meters diameter, itself surrounded by a parterre. The inauguration was made by the Queen consort of Spain [[Maria Christina of Austria]] in 1885. The monument is 7&amp;nbsp;meters high (the statue itself is 2.65&amp;nbsp;meters) and lies at the center of a roundabout named after the statue, that also gives its name to an entrance of the park.

While the work, turned over by a student{{clarify|date=March 2014}}, initially received its share of criticisms{{vague|date=March 2014}},&lt;ref name="elprado"/&gt; it was mainly highly received by the critics and is now an attraction of the Spanish capital. It is renowned for its dramatic appeal, the tension in the expression and its ambiguity in treating a polemical subject that caused turmoil regarding its possible interpretation as a satanic tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaventanadesdemadrid.com/retiro-angel-caido.html|title=El Retiro, El Ángel Caído|website=unaventanadesdemadrid.com/|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the reputation to be the only prominent sculpture dedicated to the [[devil]]{{verify source|date=July 2015}}.

'''Ghinnawa'''s (literally "little songs") are short, two line emotional [[lyric poem]]s written by the [[Bedouin]]s of [[Egypt]], in a fashion similar to [[haiku]]s, but similar in content to the American [[blues]].&lt;ref name = "lila"&gt;Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society, by Lila Abu-Lugodh, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Ghinnawas typically talk of deep, personal feelings and are often an outlet for personal emotions which might not be otherwise expressible in Bedouin society. Ghinnawas may also be sung. [[Lila Abu Lughod]] - the [[Arab American]] [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], who studied the [[Awlad Ali]] Bedouins in Northern Egypt in the late 1970s, and collected over 450 ghinnawas, has published the most comprehensive work on ghinnawas to date.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

Ghinnawa is a form of [[folk poetry]], in the sense that anyone in Awlad Ali society could author a ghinnawa. In a broader context, ghinnawas may be looked upon as non-standard discourse which are a means of coping with social reality, similar to other discourse forms in the Arab world like the [[Hikaya]] [[Folklore|folktale]]s of [[Tunisia]], or the [[Gussa]] [[allegories]] of the Bedouin of the [[Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;Between segmentation and desegmentation: Sound expressions among the Berbers in the Sous region (Southwestern Morocco), by Horiuchi Masaki, Cultures Sonores d'Afrique (ed. J. Kawada), Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Tokyo, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Ghinnawas usually have sad themes - typically being the lament of lost love, unless sung at celebrations like a [[circumcision]] or a wedding. Ghinnawas are sung by women, boys and also on rare occasions by men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marthablake.com/ghinnawa.html  The Ghinnawa: How Bedouin Women's' Poetry Supplements Social Expression] by Martha Blake&lt;/ref&gt; Ghinnawa [[semantics]] are well-defined only in context, because of their personal nature. Contents of ghinnawas are considered personal, even sensitive to the extent that Lila Abu Lughod was warned "never to reveal any women's poems to men".&lt;ref&gt;Songs from the nomadic heart, Literary Review of Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin society by Lila Abu-Lughod; by Inea Bushnaq; [[New York Times]], February 15, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social expression==

The Awlad Ali do not have a strong history of public displays of emotion. Modesty or deference and boasting or anger are typically the most commonly expressed public emotion. Most other forms of expression take place through ''ghinnawa''s.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

==Delivery and structure==

Ghinnawas may be written down, which is often the case for inter-gender communication, but can be spoken as substitute to normal conversation, or sung. The structure of the ghinnawa is very different in written and oral forms.

Structurally, ghinnawas are approximately 15-[[syllable]] [[couplets]]. They can be broken up into 2 [[hemistiche]]s. If the written form be represented as :
&lt;center&gt;
1234&lt;br&gt;
56789
&lt;/center&gt;
the oral form unspools into 16 lines as follows:
&lt;center&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
6789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
6789&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
781&lt;br&gt;
1234&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
78&lt;br&gt;
56&lt;br&gt;
56789
&lt;/center&gt;
Each ghinnawa typically has many variations, and may even be sung with minor variations in a single singing.&lt;ref name = "lila"/&gt;

'''HUGE Improv Theater''' is a [[Minneapolis]] theater founded in 2005 dedicated to long form [[improvisational theater]]. The non-profit theater acquired its own building in 2010, where it runs scheduled nightly improv performances, acts as one of the [[Minnesota Fringe Festival]]'s venues, and hosts the annual Twin Cities Improv Festival.

The '''''Hartford Courant''''' is the largest daily [[newspaper]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Connecticut]], and is often recognized as the oldest continuously published newspaper in the [[United States]].  A morning newspaper serving most of the state north of [[New Haven]] and east of [[Waterbury]], its headquarters on Broad Street are a short walk from the [[Connecticut State Capitol|state capitol]]. It reports regional news with a chain of bureaus in smaller cities and a series of local editions. It also operates [[CTNow]], a Connecticut entertainment, dining and events [http://www.ctnow.com/ website]. 

Beginning in 2000, it was owned by [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]], which later combined the paper's management and facilities with those of Tribune-owned [[WTIC-TV]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].  In 2014, the newspapers were spun off to corporate parent [[Tribune Publishing]].

The ''Connecticut Courant'' began as a weekly on October 29, 1764, started by Thomas Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/the-oldest-continuously-published-newspaper-today-in-history/ |title=The Oldest Continuously Published Newspaper – Today in History |website=ConnecticutHistory.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-6212003.html |title=Spiked: how chain management corrupted America's oldest newspaper |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |periodical=[[The Nation]] |first=Bruce |last=Shapiro |authorlink=Bruce Shapiro |date=December 19, 1987 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}} {{Subscription required|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8193695.html |title=First Colonial Newspaper Now on Exhibit in Boston |via=HighBeam Research |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=Affiliated Publications |first=Gloria |last=Negri |date=September 26, 1990 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}} {{Subscription required|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "courant", borrowed from the French (possibly by way of Dutch ''krant''),  was a popular name for English-language newspapers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The daily ''Hartford Courant'' traces its existence back to the weekly, thereby claiming the title "America's oldest continuously published newspaper", and adopting as its slogan, "Older than the nation." (''[[The New Hampshire Gazette]]'', which started publication in 1756 and all but disappeared into other publications for most of a century, trademarked the title of oldest paper in the nation after being revived as a small biweekly in 1989. See also the ''[[New York Post]]'' as oldest daily, and ''Time'' magazine's view of "oldest" claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870976,00.html |title=Newspapers: Who's the Oldest What? |periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=May 1, 1964 |accessdate=January 15, 2014|format=subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Joseph Roswell Hawley]], a leading Republican politician and former governor of the state, in 1867 bought the newspaper, which he combined with the ''Press.'' Under his editorship, this became the most influential newspaper in Connecticut and one of the leading Republican papers in the country.

Emile Gauvereau became a reporter in 1916, and the managing editor in 1919. His energetic and often sensational news policies affronted Charles Clark, the owner and editor. Clark fired him when he refused to stop a series of stories about the exploitation of fake medical diplomas.

[[Herbert Brucker]] was the most prominent editor in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Brucker, ''Journalist, eyewitness to history'' (Macmillan, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===

The ''Courant'' was purchased in 1979 by [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{-'}} parent company. The first years of out-of-town ownership are described by a former ''Courant'' reporter in a book titled ''Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper.'' &lt;ref name=2007data&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Kreig |title=Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper |year=1987 |location=Old Saybrook, Connecticut |publisher=Peregrine Press |isbn=978-0-933614-27-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism was that the new owners were more interested in awards, and less interested in traditional ''Courant'' devotion to exhaustive coverage of  local news.

The ''Courant'' won a 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for inquiring into problems with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (a Connecticut company was involved in the construction), and it won a 1999 Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for coverage of a 1998 [[Connecticut Lottery killings|murder-suicide]] that took five lives at [[Connecticut Lottery]] headquarters. A series of articles about sexual abuse by the head of a worldwide Catholic order, published since February 1997, constituted the first denunciation of [[Marciel Maciel]] known to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-marcial-maciel-sg,0,5607762.storygallery |title=Courant Coverage of the Rev.

[[File:The Hartford Courant building in downtown Hartford, seen from I-84 East.jpg|thumb|The current building of the Hartford Courant Co.]]
In 2000, Times Mirror and the ''Courant'' became part of the [[Tribune Company]], one of the world's largest multimedia companies. Ironically, along the way, the ''Courant'' also acquired the [[Valley Advocate]] group of "alternative" weeklies started by two disgruntled ''Courant'' staff members in 1973.  Under new ownership, it is co-owned with two local television stations:  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WTIC-TV]] and [[The CW]] affiliate [[WCCT-TV]].

The ''Courant'' is the most recent American newspaper to win the [[Society for News Design]]'s World's Best Designed Newspaper award (awarded in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienhandbuch.de/news/die-zeit-worlds-best-designed-newspaper-2004-auszeichnung-erhalten-2328.html "'Die Zeit': World's Best Designed Newspaper 2004 Auszeichnung erhalten"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} March 2, 2005 ''medienhandbuch.de'' accessed May 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the paper's investigation into mental health and suicides among Americans serving in the Iraq war was featured in the PBS documentary series ''[[Exposé: America's Investigative Reports]]'' in an episode entitled "Question 7".

In late June 2006, the Tribune Co. announced that ''Courant'' publisher Jack W. Davis Jr. would by replaced by Stephen D. Carver, vice president and general manager of Atlanta, Ga., TV station WATL. In March 2009, Tribune replaced Carver with Richard Graziano, who was given a dual role as Courant publisher and general manager of Tribune's two Hartford television stations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In May of the same year, Tribune announced that Jeff Levine, a newspaper executive with a background in marketing, would become "director of content" and that the editor or "print platform manager" of the ''Courant'' would report to Levine as would the news director of WTIC-TV. Shortly after that, the ''Courant's'' two highest ranking editors were let go.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/05/check_out_the_n.php "Check Out The New 'Mr. Content'"] ''New Haven Independent'' May 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=13039  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523221326/http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=13039 |date=May 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2010, ''Courant'' has offered early retirement and buyout packages to reduce staff as it continues to experience declines in advertising revenue. There have also been layoffs and reduction in pages.  Newsroom staff peaked in 1994 at close to 400 staff, down to 175 staff by 2008, and 135 staff in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-layoffs-courant-20110707,0,4770389.story |title=Courant Trims Newsroom Jobs |first=Kenneth R. |last=Gosselin |newspaper=Hartford Courant |publisher=Tribune Publishing |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov. 18, 2013 Tribune Company announced the appointment of Nancy Meyer as Publisher, succeeding Rich Graziano who left to become President/General Manager of WPIX-TV (PIX11) in New York City.  In 2014, the ''Courant'' purchased the ''[[ReminderNews]]'' chain of weekly newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/hartford-ct-courant-to-acquire-remindernews-publications/|title=Hartford (CT) Courant to Acquire ReminderNews Publications – Editor &amp; Publisher|website=Editorandpublisher.com|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2014 Tribune Company announced the appointment of Rick Daniels as publisher of the Hartford Courant, succeeding Nancy Meyer who was promoted to Publisher and CEO of the Orlando Sentinel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-new-courant-publisher-rick-daniels-nancy-meyer-20141010-story.html|title=Rick Daniels Named Courant Publisher; Nancy Meyer Leaving For Florida Media Group|first=KENNETH R.|last=GOSSELIN|website=Hartford Courant|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Julien was named the combined publisher and editor in March 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gosselin |first1=Ken |title=Julien Named Courant Publisher And Editor-in-Chief In Tribune Shake-Up |url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-tribune-courant-20160302-story.html |accessdate=20 September 2018 |agency=The Hartford Courant |date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2018, the Hartford Courant joined more than 300 newspapers in releasing editorials in response to President's Trump's anti-media rhetoric, a show of solidarity initiated by [[The Boston Globe]]. "The Hartford Courant joins newspapers from around the country today to reaffirm that the press is not the enemy of the American people.''"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/opinion/editorials/hc-ed-enemy-of-the-american-people-20180810-story.html|title=Editorial: The President Wants You To Think We're The Enemy.

==Controversies==

===Sleepy's===
In August 2009, the ''Courant'' attracted some controversy over its firing of George Gombossy, a 40-year veteran of the paper and its consumer advocate at the time. Gombossy charged that the ''Courant'' had [[Spike (journalism)|spiked]] an article he had written about an ongoing investigation by the [[Connecticut Attorney General|Connecticut attorney general]] accusing [[Sleepy's]] (a major advertiser in the paper) of selling used and bedbug-infested mattresses as new.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelaurelct.com/2009/08/07/hartford-courant-losing-its-watchdog/ Hartford Courant losing its watchdog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813200110/http://thelaurelct.com/2009/08/07/hartford-courant-losing-its-watchdog/ |date=2009-08-13 }}, The Laurel newspaperman's blog, retrieved August 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerist.com/5338201/hartford-courant-consumer-columnist-fired-for-pissing-off-advertiser Hartford Courant Consumer Columnist Fired For Pissing Off Advertiser], Consumerist blog, retrieved August 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/business/media/18courant.html Hartford Courant lays off consumer columnist], The New York Times, retrieved August 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gombossy's lawsuit against the ''Courant'' was thrown out by a [[Connecticut Superior Court]] judge in July 2010.  In his decision, Judge Marshall K. Berger, Jr. remarked that newspaper owners and editors have a "paramount" right to "control [the] content of their papers," further observing that in his role at the ''Courant'', Gombossy had "no constitutional right to publish anything."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/2010-07-02/news/hc-gombossy-lawsuit-0702-20100701_1_dismisses-judge-george-gombossy Judge Dismisses Former Columnist's Lawsuit Against The ''Courant''], The Hartford Courant, retrieved July 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gombossy's attorneys filed a second complaint, and Judge Berger reinstated the complaint.  The case headed to trial in the fall of 2011.

===Plagiarism===
In September 2009 the ''Courant's'' publisher, Richard Graziano, publicly apologized as the newspaper accepted a plagiarism charge.  Competitors had accused the ''Courant'' of taking its content without permission and refusing to give proper credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard J.

== Community ==

=== Camp Courant ===
For over 123 years Camp Courant has been a centerpiece in the Hartford community and a welcomed signifier of summer for the city's youth. The camp was founded in 1894 by a group of Hartford Courant  employees who wanted to make a difference and today the camp now now serves over 1,000 of Hartford's children, ages five to 12, generally between 500 - 600 children per day for six weeks each summer. Camp Courant is the largest free summer day camp in the country and is the only summer camp servicing Hartford's inner-city youth. The program provides transportation, preventive and acute health and social work services, two meals a day, and recreational, educational and developmental activities, all at no cost to the camper or their family. The camp totes programming that helps campers develop into healthy, responsible adults. Camp Courant is located on a 36-acre site in Farmington, which is leased from the City of Hartford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campcourant.org/about-camp/|title=About Camp Courant|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawaiian archipelago]] consists of 137 islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] that are far from any other land. [[Polynesia]]ns arrived there one to two thousand years ago, and in 1778 [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] and his crew became the first [[Europe]]ans to visit [[Hawaii]] (which they called the Sandwich Islands). The art created in these islands may be divided into art existing prior to Cook’s arrival; art produced by recently arrived westerners; and art produced by Hawaiians incorporating western materials and ideas. Public collections of Hawaiian art may be found at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]], the [[Bishop Museum]] (Honolulu), the [[Hawaii State Art Museum]] and the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]] in Germany.

In 1967, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to implement a [[Percent for Art]] law. The Art in State Buildings Law established the Art in Public Places Program and designated one percent of the construction costs of new public schools and state buildings for the acquisition of works of art, either by commission or by purchase.

==Art prior to Cook's arrival==
[[File:Kuka'ilimoku.jpg|thumb|right|Kii-Hulu Manu (Hawaiian feathered image), 18th century, believed to represent Kuka’ilimoku, wicker, feathers, mother-of-pearl, dog teeth, Cook-Forster Collection of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]], Germany]]

Art existing prior to Cook’s arrival is very similar to the art of other Pacific Islanders. This art includes [[wood carving]]s, feather work, [[petroglyph]]s, bark cloth (called [[kapa]] in Hawaiian and [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] elsewhere in the Pacific) and tattoos. Native Hawaiians had neither [[metal]] nor woven cloth. Production of this art continued after Cook’s arrival. A few craftsmen still produce traditional Hawaiian arts, either to sell to tourists or to preserve native culture.

==Art produced by visitors==

Some of the first westerners to visit Hawaii were artists&amp;mdash;both professional and amateur. Many of the explorers’ ships had professional artists to record their discoveries.

'''Historicism''' or also '''historism''' ({{lang-de|Historismus}}) comprises artistic styles that draw their inspiration from recreating historic styles or imitating the work of historic artisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward]]. ''The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1988, p. 100. {{ISBN|0-500-20222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as [[revival architecture]]. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus it offers a great variety of possible designs.

In the [[history of art]], after [[Neoclassicism]] which in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked by an interpretation not only of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[classicism]], but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of [[history painting]], in which historical subjects were treated of with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the end of the century, in the ''[[fin de siècle]]'', [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]] followed by [[Expressionism (architecture)|Expressionism]] and [[Modernism]] acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles.

Influences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries. When [[postmodern architecture]] became widely popular in the 1980s, a movement of [[Neo-Historism]] followed, that is still prominent and can be found around the world, especially in [[Representation (arts)|representative]] and upper-class buildings.

The '''Ibero-American Exposition of 1929''' (Spanish: '''''Exposición iberoamericana de 1929''''') was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Seville]], [[Spain]], from 9 May 1929 until 21 June 1930. Countries in attendance of the exposition included: Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, the Republic of Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Each [[Spanish region]] and each of the [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] of [[Andalusia]] were also represented. Spain’s Dictator General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] gave the opening address. Primo de Rivera allowed the Spanish King [[Alfonso XIII]] to give the final words and officially open the exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to improve relations between Spain and the countries in attendance, all of which have historical ties with Spain through [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization]] (parts of [[Spanish America]] and the United States) or [[Iberian Union|political union]] (Portugal and its former colony Brazil). Other countries were represented at the ''[[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International section]]'' in Barcelona.
 
The exposition was smaller in scale than the International Exposition held in Barcelona during that same year, but it was not lacking in style. The city of Seville had prepared for the Exposition over the course of 19 years.  The exhibition buildings were constructed in [[María Luisa Park]] along the [[Guadalquivir River]]. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanent after the closing of the exposition.  Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening of the Exposition, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the medieval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.

== Spanish pavilions and exhibits ==

[[File:Estatua Aníbal González 2.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Aníbal González]]
Spain spent a large amount of money in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture. Spanish architect [[Aníbal González Álvarez-Ossorio|Aníbal González]] designed the largest and most famous of the buildings, which surrounded the [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]]. The largest of the exhibits housed in this building was located in the “Salón del Descubrimento de América.” The ''Salón'' contained documents, maps, and other objects related to the discovery of the [[Americas]], including a set of 120 letters and manuscript that had belonged to [[Christopher Columbus]], the last testament of [[Hernán Cortés]], and detailed dioramas of historic moments. An exact replica of Columbus's ship the "[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]," complete with a costumed crew, floated on the Guadalquivir River. The cities of Spain contributed structures designed to reflect their unique cultures to be placed in the "Pabellones de las regiones españolas" ("Pavilions of the Spanish regions").  Spain’s exhibits also included a large collection of art located in the Palacio Mudéjar ("[[Mudéjar art]] palace"), Palacio Renacimiento ("[[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]] palace"), and the Palacio de la Casa Real ("Palace of the Royal House"). The Institute of Art from the [[University of Seville]] was moved to the Palacio Mudéjar for the duration of the exposition on the permission gained from the exposition committee by [[Count Columbi]]. The committee also set aside funds from their budget to purchase materials for the Institute.

== United States Exhibits ==
[[File:Pabellon de estados unidos 2.JPG|thumb|United States Pavilion (2013)]]
The United States' contribution to the exposition consisted of three buildings and marked the end to a several year period in which the United States did not construct buildings for foreign expositions. The main building was to serve as the U.S. consulate office after the closing of the Ibero-American exposition, and housed a menagerie of electrical appliances including oil furnaces, electric refrigerators, airplane models, and miniature wind tunnels. The other two structures housed a movie theatre and government exhibits, including contributions from the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Labor, the Commission of Fine Arts, the Navy, and the Library of Congress.

== Ibero-American Exhibits ==
Of the Ibero-American nations in attendance of the exposition, 10 constructed pavilions to display their exhibits. Other nations, including Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador displayed their native products in the "Galerías comerciales americanas" ("Commercial galleries of the Americas").

[[File:Pabellón de Perú.jpg|thumb|Peruvian pavilion (2009)]]
The largest of the ten pavilions was the '''Peruvian pavilion''', which was designed by the architect Don [[Manuel Piqueras Cotolí]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885-1937): Arquitecto, escultor y urbanista entre España y el Perú. Luis Eduardo Wuffarden, Editor. Museo de Arte de Lima, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion contained a large archeology collection consisting of three halls filled with pre-Columbian era artifacts, which were to be kept on permanent display. The pavilion also contained an agricultural exhibit filled with stuffed [[vicuña]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[guanaco]]s.  The exhibit was complemented by a pack of live llamas grazing on the pavilion grounds.

The '''Republic of Colombia''' constructed a pavilion designed by Seville architect [[José Granados]]. The pavilion included a collection of sculpture and artwork by Colombian artist [[Rómulo Rozo]], and of Colombian emeralds, and a coffee café that demonstrated all of the steps in coffee cultivation.

The '''Brazilian pavilion''' also contained a coffee cultivation exhibit complete with panoramas and models illustrating the different phases of cultivation. Architect [[Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos]] designed the pavilion, which also included a coffee bar.

'''Chilean''' architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|es|3=Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|lt=Juan Martínez}} designed the three-story building that served as home to Chile's exhibits. The exhibits included displays of Chilean industries, including detailed replicas of a nitrate mine and a copper plant, [[Araucanian]] arts and crafts, and galleries displaying Chilean art and history.

The [[Mexican Pavilion from Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|'''Mexican pavilion''']], designed by [[Manuel Amabilis]], included exhibits on archeology, education, and the history of Spanish accomplishments in Mexico. Students in Mexican schools prepared some of the education exhibits.

Architect [[Martin Noel]] designed '''Argentina's pavilion''', which included a movie theatre and displays focusing on Argentinean industries and products.

'''Uruguay's pavilion''' included displays of its industrial schools, including the Institute of Agronomy and an art gallery filled with paintings and bronze sculptures.

'''Cuba''' contributed demonstrations of the sugar and tobacco industries to the exposition in their pavilion.

The '''Dominican Republic''' pavilion included a reproduction of the [[Columbus's Alcázar]].

'''Guatemala''' signed up late for the exhibition and as a result rather than resembling a huge palace its pavilion looks more like a school portable building with blue and white tiles on the front. The building contained exhibits relating to the resources found in Guatemala.

'''Venezuela''' also erected a pavilion containing displays of its resources.

[[File:Plaza España 2.jpg|thumb|Ceramic provincial alcoves and benches at Plaza de España]]
Today, many of the pavilions from the exposition remain, notably the famous [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]], which chronicles each of the regions of Spain in ceramic provincial alcoves and benches, as well as some of the national pavilions, which have now been converted to Consulate-Generals. Many of the buildings have been converted into museums and the pavilion of Argentina is now a flamenco school. They have also been featured in a number of films, including ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', among others.

For Sevillans, the exposition marked the acceptance by the upper class of the ''[[traje de flamenca]]'', an outfit worn by lower-class women.&lt;ref name="Abril"&gt;[http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 Traje de flamenca en la feria de Abril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501001724/http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 |date=2010-05-01 }}, altur.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journals of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the private journals of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. Edited by David Harriman with the approval of Rand's estate, it was published in 1997, 15 years after her death. Some reviewers considered it an interesting source of information for readers with an interest in Rand, but several scholars criticized Harriman's editing as being too heavy-handed and insufficiently acknowledged in the published text.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, her private papers were left to her student and heir [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Starting in 1983, Peikoff began authorizing the publication of excerpts from her journals and other unpublished writings. From 1983 to 1994, several such excerpts appeared in ''[[The Objectivist Forum]]''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Objectivist Forum'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Journal" (August 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (December 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (April 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Notes" (August 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for The Fountainhead" (December 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Intellectual Activist'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (January 1992)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on Scene in Roark's Apartment" (January 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on the Thomas Committee" (November 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"'Memory-Storing' Epistemology" (January 1994)&lt;br /&gt;"Ayn Rand's Journals: Selections from The Moral Basis of Individualism" (November 1995)&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Journals: Notes on The Fountainhead" (January and March 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; David Harriman, a physicist and a speaker for the [[Ayn Rand Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |title=David Harriman |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617063729/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |archivedate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited Rand's journals for publication in book form. The hardcover edition of the fully edited ''Journals of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1997. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1999.

==Contents==
In a foreword for the book, Peikoff describes Rand's journals, with a few exceptions, as being "written for herself, for her own clarity" and not intended for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preface by Harriman describes the material as being about three-quarters of Rand's "''working'' journals", collected from "numerous boxes of papers she left behind at her death". He describes his editing as consisting of "selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatory comments."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "not a great deal of line editing was required", and that his editorial insertions and "omissions of passages" are marked in the published text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the book consists of Rand's edited journals, divided into five major sections. The first section, titled "Early Projects" includes scenarios for silent movies that Rand developed when she first moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. There are also notes and outlines for her first published novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', and for another early novel that was never completed. Entries in an early "philosophic journal" from April and May 1934, are described by Rand as "the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section, titled "''The Fountainhead''", consists of material related to her [[The Fountainhead|novel of that name]]. She took extensive notes from her research on architecture, and created profiles for each character, often based on information about real people. There are several outlines of the plot and notes she made while the novel was being written.

The third section, titled "Transition Between Novels", includes draft material for three unfinished projects. The first was a non-fiction book to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. The second was a movie about the development of the [[atomic bomb]], tentatively titled ''Top Secret''. The third was an essay called "To All Innocent Fifth Columnists", to be circulated by a proposed organization of conservative intellectuals that never formed. This section also reprints a transcript of Rand's 1949 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], along with her own notes about the committee's efforts to investigate [[Communism]].

The fourth section, "''Atlas Shrugged''", has her notes and outlines for her [[Atlas Shrugged|final novel]]. In addition to planning for characters and plot points, her notes include research on the railroad and steel industries, and thoughts on various philosophical issues to be addressed in the novel.

The fifth and final section, "Final Years", covers the years 1955 to 1977. It includes notes about "psycho-epistemology" and ideas for two possible books. One was a non-fiction book about Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. The other was a novel to be titled ''To Lorne Dieterling''.

==Reception==
Objectivist philosopher [[David Kelley]] described the material in Rand's journals as "contain[ing] a number of passages that explain key points in her philosophy more fully and clearly than anything she published." Kelley called the book "a treasure" and said Harriman's editing was "skillful", although he criticized Harriman for not providing more complete notes on cases where Rand had later changed her positions from those documented in the journal entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], [[Walter Olson]] said the book was "a less-than-ideal place to start for those not already closely familiar with the Russian-born author's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said it did "furnish a deep popcorn bowl of sheer fan value" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it a "valuable sourcebook" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hardcovers in Brief |work=[[The Washington Post]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |date=November 9, 1997 |accessdate=July 9, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-759398.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', conservative writer [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] offered his "harsh assessment" that the insights Rand had about the dangers of collectivism were "made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it." For aspiring writers, he said, "The journals' central lesson is that one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review produced responses in the form of a short article in ''Liberty'' calling it an "uninformed hatchet job"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raico|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter from philosopher [[Allan Gotthelf]] calling it "the usual sneers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a bibliography of Rand's works, [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] said the book "illustrates Rand’s dedication to her craft and her meticulous preparation for writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Brooks and Gladstein indicated that the term 'journals' was misleading because the material focuses on Rand's works and ideas, instead of more personal thoughts.

Describing Rand as a rigorous but misanthropic thinker, ''[[Booklist]]'' said her journals would "be of vital interest to many".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said it was of interest only for those who were "lovers and loathers" of Rand, describing the book as being "As intriguing yet sometimes numbing as her fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forecasts: Nonfiction: ''The Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=August 4, 1997 |volume=244 |issue=32 |page=56 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-94370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' recommended the book for academic libraries, saying it would be welcomed by "Rand aficionados".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Overmyer|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the book were also published in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=July 15, 1997 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-harriman/journals-of-ayn-rand/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamiya|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about editing===
In a review of the book in [[Liberty (1987)|''Liberty'']] magazine, [[Stephen D. Cox|Stephen Cox]] questioned the editorial choices made by Harriman. He said that Harriman tried "to steer a middle course" between casual and scholarly readers of Rand's work, but he wondered "where should the line be drawn?" He cited examples given by Harriman as the types of passages omitted, saying some of them were "precisely the kind of note that scholars want to see". Cox also said that Harriman's editing for grammar and "wordiness" was insufficiently explained, which acted "to undermine the objective authority of the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|1998|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the next issue of ''Liberty'', Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] raised additional concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in ''The Intellectual Activist'' with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to [[Albert Jay Nock]] in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to be noted in the text, and said, "When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Ayn Rand Cult]]'', journalist Jeff Walker suggested the published journals might be "completely unreliable and ... may have been thoroughly twisted in the interests of the present-day cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing a [[Goddess of the Market|biography of Rand]], historian Jennifer Burns worked with the original journals in the Ayn Rand Archives, and compared the material there with published versions. She said Rand's journals had been edited in ways that are "significant and problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns said Harriman's changes "significantly alter Rand's meaning" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into "a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an entry on her blog describing her experiences at the archives, Burns said the staff of the archives "heartily disapproved" of how the book was edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In the Rand Archives, Part 2: The edited letters and diaries |url=http://www.jenniferburns.org/blog/65-in-the-rand-archives-part-2-the-edited-letters-and-diaries |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape painting in Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Landscape art|painting of landscapes]] in Scotland since its origins in the sixteenth century to the present day. The earliest examples of Scottish landscape painting are in the tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|Scottish house decoration]] that arose in the sixteenth century. Often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland is a depiction by the Flemish artist [[Alexander Keirincx]] undertaken for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

The [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] of Italian and Dutch landscapes undertaken as house decoration by James Norie and his sons in the eighteenth century brought the influence of French artists such as [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]]. Students of the Nories included [[Jacob More]] whose produced Claudian-inspired landscapes. This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature. Watercolours were pioneered in Scotland by [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Alexander Runciman]]. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] has been described as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition",&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;I. Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; and produced both urban landscapes and rural scenes that combine Claudian principles of an ideal landscape with the reality of Scottish topography. His students included major landscape painters of the early nineteenth century such as [[Andrew Wilson (artist)|Andrew Wilson]], the watercolourist [[Hugh William Williams]], John Thompson of Duddingston and probably the artists that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox. In the Victorian era, the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]], described as the "Scottish Impressionist". The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]].

The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the [[Scottish Colourists]] in the 1920s. They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]], [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]], [[Samuel Peploe]] and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]], who placed an emphasis on colour above form. The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] during or soon after the First World War, became known as [[the Edinburgh School]]. They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]] and their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included [[William George Gillies|William Gillies]], [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]], [[William Crozier (Scottish artist)|William Crozier]] and [[William MacTaggart]]. William Johnstone was one of the artists most closely associated with the [[Scottish Renaissance]], an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art. [[Stanley Cursiter]] was influenced by the [[Celtic revival]], [[post-impressionism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]. Later in his career he became a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney. Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]], both of whom were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]].

In the post-war period the English-born [[Joan Eardley]] explored the landscapes of the [[Kincardineshire]] coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential [[St Ives School]] were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]]  and [[Margaret Mellis]]. Husband and wife Tom MacDonald and [[Bet Low]] with William Senior formed the [[Clyde Group]], aimed at promoting political art and producing industrial landscapes. [[John Bellany]] focused on the coastal communities of his birth. The coastal theme would also be pursued by artists such as Elizabeth Ogilvy, [[Joyce W. Cairns]] and Ian Stephen.

The earliest examples of Scottish landscape painting are in the tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|Scottish house decoration]] for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] in the sixteenth century, partly as a response to the loss of religious patronage.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p290&gt;J.

They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Landscapes and cityscapes|Dutch landscape painting]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp58-61&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish artist [[Alexander Keirincx]] (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing [[Seton Palace|Seton House]] (1636–37) in its landscape,&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p67&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;J. Holloway and L. Errington, ''The Discovery of Scotland: the Appreciation of Scottish Scenery Through Two Centuries of Painting'' (Edinburgh: National Gallery of Scotland, 1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] or [[pastiche]]s of Italian and Dutch landscapes,&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153&gt;I.

The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp52-3&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JacobMoreNG 1897.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob More]], ''The Falls of Clyde: Corra Linn'', c. 1771|alt=Painting of a waterfall with small human figures.]]
Probably a student of the Nories was Charles Steuart (fl. 1762–90), who produced a series of [[Perthshire]] landscapes for the Duke of Atholl at [[Blair Castle]], including ''The Black Lynn, Fall on the Brann'' (1766).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp52-3 /&gt; Also among the students of the Nories was [[Jacob More]], who moved to Italy from 1773 and is chiefly known as a landscape painter who created Claudian-style, classically inspired landscapes.&lt;ref name="Baudino2011p153" /&gt; More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73), produced before his departure to Italy, have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a [[Romanticism in Scotland|romantic]] sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3 /&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by a backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly influential in this process was the Scottish philosopher [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]]'s ''Nature and Principles of Taste'' (1790), which widened the forms of landscape seen as appropriate for painting, placing an emphasis on their historical significance and emotional impact on the painter.&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p219&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Sandby]] (1731–1809), often considered the "father of British watercolour painting",&lt;ref&gt;M. Hargraves, ''Great British Watercolors: From the Paul Mellon Collection at the Yale Center for British Art'' (Yale University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-300-11658-6}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; visited Scotland as part of the military survey that followed the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]] and undertook a number of studies of Scottish scenes.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hewitt, ''Map Of A Nation: A Biography Of The Ordnance Survey'' (Granta Books, 2011), {{ISBN|1-84708-452-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His abandonment of traditional pen and ink drawing, using washes of colour in order to paint directly in watercolours without pen outlines, opened the way for the creation of powerful Romantic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;A. Wilton, ''The Great Age of British Watercolours: 1750–1880'' (Prestel Verlag GmbH &amp; Company KG., 1997), {{ISBN|3-7913-1879-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–1785) was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in [[watercolour]]s in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) trained in the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh under Runciman. He visited Italy, where he met with More, and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet [[Robert Burns]], which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p433" /&gt; He produced both urban landscapes, like ''Edinburgh from Caton Hill'' (1825), which put Edinburgh its geological context, and rural scenes such as ''Castle Huntly and The Tay'' (c. 1800). His works combined Claudian principles of an ideal landscape with the reality of Scottish topography.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp78-81&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasmyth was also a highly influential teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included [[Andrew Wilson (artist)|Andrew Wilson]] (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist [[Hugh William Williams]] (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp78-83&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them ''The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium'' (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work ''Fast Castle from Below'' (1824).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp222-5&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', pp. 222–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

[[File:McTaggart, The Storm.jpg|thumb|left|[[William McTaggart]], ''The Storm'', 1890 |alt=Painting of a sea shore in a rough weather.]]
In the Victorian era, the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136&gt;F.

Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The wildlife around Balmoral was immortalised by English painter [[Edwin Landseer]] (1802–73) in the much copied ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1851).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p105&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J.

The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the [[Scottish Colourists]] in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked for inspiration to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= |archiveurl=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |archivedate=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which [[post-impressionism]] reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575 /&gt; From 1912 Cadell visited [[Iona]] annually to paint and he was joined there by Peploe from 1920. They produced a number of works using the west-coast light and Iona landscape, particularly views of [[Ben More (Mull)|Ben More]], which both painted several times. [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], the arts and crafts artist, was still active in the early twentieth century and painted several landscapes similar in style to those of Cadell and Peploe.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p162&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter used a vibrant palette to create notable paintings of the landscape around [[Balloch, Highland|Balloch]] on Loch Lomond.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp163-4&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Leading architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928) abandoned architecture for painting after World War I and created a number of landscapes, particularly of southern France. He became associated with Fergusson, who pursued also experimental landscape in the inter-war years, many of which were around his home in the Highlands, like that at ''Craigcornash'' (c. 1925). The work of Mackintosh and Fergusson has similarities to that of [[David Young Cameron]] (1865–1945) who pursued the systematic painting of the Highlands in his later years.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p178&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Johnstone (1897–1981) was one of the artists most closely associated with the [[Scottish Renaissance]], an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173&gt;M.

In the post-war period the English-born [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63) moved to Glasgow, where she was a graduate of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] and explored the landscapes of the [[Kincardineshire]] coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (1912–2004) and [[Margaret Mellis]] (1914–2009).&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p193"&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000) was resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; where he influenced husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–1985) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art.

'''''Landscape with the Flight into Egypt''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. Dating from c. 1604, it remains in the palace for which it was painted in [[Rome]] as part of the collection of the [[Galleria Doria Pamphilj]].

The painting, depicting the biblical New Testament event of the ''[[Flight into Egypt]]'', was commissioned in 1603 by Cardinal [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] for the family chapel in his palace in Rome, later known as [[Palazzo Doria Pamphilj]]. The commission includes six paintings in six [[lunette]]s, which were executed by Carracci and his pupils (including [[Francesco Albani]], [[Domenichino]] and [[Giovanni Lanfranco]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 317&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is frequently regarded as a key work in Baroque [[landscape painting]] and is the "most celebrated example" of the "new landscape style" Carracci developed in Rome of "carefully constructed landscape panoramas", according to [[Rudolf Wittkower]].&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[John Rupert Martin]] it is "the archetypal classical landscape, later to be emulated with variations by Domenichino, [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] ... the small scale of the figures in relation to the spacious natural setting at once establishes a new priority in which landscape takes first place and history second";&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 60&lt;/ref&gt; though insofar as it is "new", that is for Italian painting, as such works had been common in Northern painting since [[Joachim Patinir]] began to use the same reversal of scale almost a century before.  The journey of the [[Holy Family]] is echoed by other moving elements including the sheep, birds, cows and the camels on the ridge at left.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 176&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wittkower sees in it "a heroic and aristocratic conception of Nature tamed and ennobled by the presence of man", as such works always contain a large man-made feature, here the castle "severely composed of horizontals and verticals" under which the party moves.  They are placed at the meeting of two diagonals represented by the sheep and the river, "thus figures and buildings are intimately blended with the carefully arranged pattern of the landscape".&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Kenneth Clark]] mentions the work as an example of the "ideal landscape" driven to promote itself in the [[hierarchy of genres]] by emulating (in the absence of much evidence of what classical landscape painting was like) an essentially literary vision, largely derived from the pastoral poems of [[Virgil]]: "the features of which it is composed must be chosen from nature, as poetic diction is chosen from ordinary speech, for their elegance, their ancient associations, and their faculty of harmonious combination. ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Clark's praise of the work is noticeably faint, as it lacks the spirit he finds in [[Giorgione]] and Claude in the same tradition: "At their best, as in the lunettes in the Doria Gallery, Annibale Carracci's landscapes are admirable pieces of picture-making, in which agreeably stylized parts are built up into a harmonious whole. We recognize the science which has gone into the construction of the castle in the centre of the ''Flight into Egypt''... But in the end these eclectic landscapes are of interest only to historians".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 74; see the rest of the chapter for more whole-hearted praise of Giorgione and Claude.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light art''' or '''luminism'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=vyiiW3uL49sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22light%20art%22&amp;f=false Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[applied arts|applied art]] form in which [[light]] is the main medium of expression.  It is an art form in which either a [[sculpture]] produces [[light]], or light is used to create a "sculpture" through the manipulation of light, colours, and shadows. These sculptures can be temporary or permanent, and can exist in two distinctive spaces: indoor galleries, such as museum exhibits, or outdoors at events like festivals. Light art can be an interaction of light with in an architectural space. Light artists are those that devote all their creative experimentation to light art, some artists experiment with light and neon signage and use light in their practice.

The first examples of modern light art appeared after the discovery of electric lighting made longterm lighting safe and affordable at the end of the 19th century. Light art however didn't become a dedicated form of art until the late 20th century, due in large part due to pioneering work begun in 1969, as part of an experimental program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, by Robert Irwin and James Turrell.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;Glenn Shrum, [http://www.archlighting.com/projects/light-art-matters_o Light Art Matters - A closer look at the ideas behind the work]&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Modernism, Constructivism and the Bauhaus (1920–1935)===
{{see also|Modern art|Constructivism (art)|Bauhaus}}
Light has been used for architectural effect throughout human history. However, the modern concept of light art emerged with the development of artificial electric [[Incandescence|incandescent]] [[light sources]] and experimentation by [[modern art]]ists of the Constructivist and Bauhaus movements.&lt;ref name=Weibel /&gt; "''Prounenraum'' (''Proun Room'') (1923), by [[El Lissitzky]], is considered by many art historians to be the first time an artist incorporated architectural lighting elements as a component integral to his work."&lt;ref name=gs /&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/08/replicas-and-reconstructions-in-twentieth-century-art | title=Replicas and Reconstructions in Twentieth-Century Art: El Lissitzky, Prounenraum 1923, reconstruction 1971 | publisher=Tate | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} The first object-based light sculpture was the ''Light-Space Modulator'' (1922-1930), by [[László Moholy-Nagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080613012021/http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-06-13 | title=László Moholy-Nagy, Tate bio | publisher=tate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunstlexikon" /&gt;&lt;!--This list of examples needs to be drawn from the list of a reliable source. Karl Popper gives such a list for "neon artists"--&gt; Experimentation and innovations in theatrical light have often influenced other areas of light use such as light art. The development of Modernism and the electric light go hand-in-hand; the idea of the modern city with high-rises and electric light epitomizes this development.

All visual art uses light in some form, but in modern [[photography]] and [[motion pictures]], use of light is especially important. However, with the invention of electrical [[artificial light]], possibilities expanded and many artists began using light as the main form of expression, rather than solely as a vehicle for other forms of art. [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] [[Naum Gabo]] experimented with the transparent materiality light reflects on an object; his ''Linear Construction No. 1'' (1943) provides an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gabo-linear-construction-no-1-t00191 | title=Linear Construction No. 1 1942–3 | publisher=Tate | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Duchamp's]] ''Hat Rack'' (1916 and 1964), hangs from the ceiling and casts a shadow against the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hat Rack {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|url = http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/73661|website = www.artic.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Hilarie M. Sheets explains that "the interplay of dark and light has been a theme running from Greek and Roman sculpture to Renaissance painting to experimental film. But as technology advanced from the glow of the electric light bulb to the computer monitor, artists have been experimenting with actual light as material and subject."&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, Hilarie M. "Waves of Light." ARTnews Mar. 2007: 131-33. ARTnews. Print. Web. 1 Feb. 2012. http://www.artnews.com/2007/03/01/waves-of-light/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projection mapping===
{{see also|Projection mapping}}

Closely associated art forms are projectors, 3-D map projection, multi-media, video art, and photography where light technology ''projects'' images rather than using light as the medium. Large light festivals and events have helped to develop the use of light on large canvases such as architectural facades, building projections, the flood lighting of buildings with colour, and interactive media facades. These forms of light art have their antecedents in new media-based, video art and photography which are sometimes classified as light art since light and movement are important to the work.

===Digital graffiti===
{{see also|Digital graffiti}}

Also included in the light art genre is the so-called [[light graffiti]] including projection onto buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/07/architectural-light-graffiti-projection-bombing-images-on-urban-surfaces | title=Architectural Light Graffiti: Image Projection Bombing | publisher=Webist Media | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrangement of lighted windows in buildings, and painting with hand-held lights onto film using time exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weburbanist.com/2008/12/07/light-graffiti-art-photos | title=Luminaries: 20 Light Graffiti Artists &amp; Photographers | publisher=Webist Media | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light Art Installation ===
An example of a light art installation was that of artists [[Mel and Dorothy Tanner]], who began adding light to their paintings and sculptures at their studio in Miami, Florida in 1967. This was the same time period as that of [[Light and Space]] artists [[James Turrell]] and [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] in Los Angeles, on the opposite U.S. coast. The Tanners worked very closely for over 40 years until Mel Tanner died in 1993. Their main project was the creation of ''Lumonics'' that consists of their light sculptures, live projection, video, electronics and music as a total [[Installation art|art installation]]. Author and art historian, [[Michael Betancourt]] described this conceptual art as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] in his book, ''The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel &amp; Dorothy Tanner''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel and Dorothy Tanner|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|publisher=Wildside Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8095-1193-2|location=Maryland, United States:|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' published in 2004. Dorothy Tanner, born in 1923, continues her light art from her studio in Denver, and co-directs the Lumonics School of Light Art with Marc Billard.

===Museums===
Many modern [[art museum]]s include light sculptures and installations in their permanent and temporary collections.  The [[Centre for International Light Art]] in [[Unna]], [[Germany]] is currently the world's only museum dedicated exclusively to the collection and presentation of light art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/take-an-electrifying-look-inside-the-worlds-first-light-art-museum | title=Take An Electrifying Look Inside The World's First Light Art Museum | publisher=Vice Media Inc. | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://light2015blog.org/2014/08/08/only-light-museum-grants-international-light-art-award/ | title=The World’s Only Light Art Museum Grants the International Light Art Award 2015 | publisher=International Year of Light 2015 - Blog | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Light Art Museum in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]], another museum dedicated to the display of light art, closed on December 5, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://luminapolis.com/en/2010/11/closed-the-light-art-museum-in-eindhoven/|title=Closed: The Light Art Museum in Eindhoven|date=November 28, 2010|work=Luminapolis: The World of Lighting|accessdate=2016-01-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; due to insufficient funding, but at the [[Strijp-S]] complex, one can see the '''Fakkel''' by Har Hollands, [[Daan Roosegaarde]]'s '''Crystal''' as well as part of the light festival '''[[GLOW Festival Eindhoven|GLOW]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/herbeleef-glow-eindhoven-routes-en-hoogtepunten-door-de-jaren-heen-1.4075747 Herbeleef Glow Eindhoven: Routes en hoogtepunten door de jaren heen]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/licht-zien-voelen-en-zelfs-opslaan-op-glow-next-1.4615697 Licht zien, voelen en zelfs opslaan op Glow Next]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many well-known art museums, such as the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, often have temporary light art exhibits and installations in their galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/jim-campbell/|title=Jim Campbell|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/31?locale=en|title=Take your time: Olafur Eliasson {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/sfmoma-celebrates-artist-leo-villareal-in-anticip/|title=SFMOMA CELEBRATES ARTIST LEO VILLAREAL IN ANTICIPATION OF LIGHT INSTALLATION ON BAY BRIDGE|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light festivals===
Light festivals and the smart city LED revolution was driven by outdoor urban light sculpture with low energy LED [[light fixture|luminaires]]. Light artists were able to create new exhibition spaces collectively in the form of light art festivals. These festivals have continued to grow internationally and help to highlight ecological change. This LED low energy movement dates back to the 2009 by the Vivid Smart Light Festival in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartlightsydney.org/ | title=Smart Light Sydney | publisher=Smart Light Sydney | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, the [[i Light Marina Bay]] festival—Asia's only sustainable light festival—was first hosted in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=i Light Marina Bay invites artists to submit proposals|url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2015/apr/pr15-21.aspx|publisher=Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many light art festivals, especially in Europe, including the [[Signal Festival]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Ghent]] Light Festival. Light festivals and LEDS have redefined light art as an art genre.&lt;ref&gt;"SuperLux: Smart Light Art, Design &amp; Architecture for Cities" published by Thames and Hudson Author Davina Jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light Art Awards===
The International Light Art Award, presented by the Centre for International Light Art Unna and the RWE Foundation, is given to up-and-coming artists who will contribute "to the development of light art in an innovative and creative way"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilaa.eu/en/the-award|title=International Light Art Award|last=NL,|first=Zentrum für Internationale Lichtkunst Unna // Design: RAW COLOR, Eindhoven,|website=www.ilaa.eu|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in existence since 2015.

The award is meant to encourage artists to explore light art, despite the difficulties the relatively new style faces, including the financial and technical requirements needed for a light art exhibit.  The foundations behind the ILAA also wish to put emphasis on [[sustainability]] and new technologies within the medium of light expression.

The Australian and New Zealand Engineering Illumination Society ANZIES began giving an annual award to light artists at the Vivid Light Festival in 2010.  
Vivid Light festival grants help support local and international light artists in the pursuit of their medium.
2015 The DARC awards, supported by Mondo Arc Magazine, began selecting winners for their light art awards.
The International Association of Lighting Design the IALD, a North American-based organization, also gives out an annual award for light art.

The '''Motion Picture Association of America''' ('''MPAA''') is an American [[trade association]] representing the [[Major film studio#Current|six major film studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Founded in 1922 as the '''Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America''' ('''MPPDA'''), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film rating system]] in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).

More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the [[Film|motion picture]] and [[television]] industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb [[copyright infringement]], including recent attempts to limit the sharing of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file-sharing]] networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France [[Charles Rivkin]] is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.

==History==

===Foundation and early history: 1922–29===

The MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a [[trade association]] of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT22a&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultimatum by Hays to Purify Movies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/05/archives/ultimatum-by-hays-to-purify-movies-producers-and-distrihuters-join.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Will H. Hays]] was named the association's first president.&lt;ref name=Kimono&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn=0813190118 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that [[Hollywood]] remained financially stable and able to attract investment from [[Wall Street]], while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a "clean moral tone".&lt;ref name=NYT22a /&gt;&lt;ref name=EvenNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Attacks Censors; Says Film Men O.K. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhdLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IiENAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2733%2C7216162 |work=The Evening News |date=26 May 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen.  Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spokesman24&gt;{{cite news |title=Czar of Movies Hits Censorship |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Np5XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t_MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=5826%2C734859 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=25 January 1924 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public [[Censorship in the United States#Film censorship|censorship]],&lt;ref name="Spokesman24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT22b&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Says Public Censors Will Fail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/25/archives/hays-says-public-censors-will-fail-declares-american-principle-of.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship.&lt;ref name=ProvNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays, Pledging Motion Picture Industry to Clean Pictures, Asks Public to Aid War on Evil Films |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFBbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QVANAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4100%2C1398046 |work=Providence News |date=6 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

At the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt; Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

In 1924, Hays instituted "The Formula", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. "The Formula" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.&lt;ref name=Black96&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory D. Black |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521565928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybKqnNNR7hwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hollywood+Censored:+Morality+Codes,+Catholics,+and+the+Movies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hIweUZuEJsHe0QG6zoHgBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" for the industry.&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls," and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production,&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===Production Code: 1930–34===

In 1930, the MPPDA introduced the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], sometimes called the "Hays Code". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films.&lt;ref name=TeleHerald30&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie Industry to Bar Obscenity and Crime Scenes, Plan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-K9FAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pb0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3907%2C1202519 |work=The Telegraph-Herald and Times-Journal |date=2 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the "Dont's and Be Carefuls", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; The Code incorporated many of the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of "scenes of passion" unless they were essential to a film's plot; "pointed profanity" in either word or action; "sex perversion"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with "indecent" moves; and white slavery.&lt;ref name=Calgary30&gt;{{cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

In 1933 and 1934 the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]], along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.&lt;ref name=Bernstein00&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controlling+Hollywood:+Censorship+and+Regulation+in+the+Studio+Era&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eIseUamHDaa00AHX1oH4Bg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), with [[Joseph Breen]] as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA,&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide "Production Code" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===War years: 1935–45===

In the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=LewistonTrib34&gt;{{cite news |title=Pictures Purged |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z5fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wzEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3861%2C4395343 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=15 July 1934 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films&lt;ref name=SpokaneChron35&gt;{{cite news |title=Newest Pictures Based on Classics |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=atRXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_fQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2505%2C6402892 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=26 March 1935 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued promoting American films abroad.&lt;ref name=MilJournal36&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays Gets Italy to Lift Film Blockage |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PHYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_yEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays&amp;pg=6885%2C5924504 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=25 November 1936 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=PittPress38&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Scores Propaganda On Screens |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LE0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D0wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4508%2C6029095 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=30 March 1938 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.&lt;ref name="SpokesReview45"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston to Rule Movies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vipWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6105%2C4697631 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=20 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnston era: 1945–63===

In 1945 the MPPDA hired [[Eric Johnston]], four-time president of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], to replace Hays.&lt;ref name=SpokChron45&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnston Named Motion Picture Czar |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jvUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6668%2C3421898 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=19 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

He also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries.&lt;ref name=Lewis02p37&gt;{{cite book |author=Jon Lewis |title=Hollywood V.

In 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were "within the limits of good taste". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.&lt;ref name=RG56&gt;{{cite news |title=Motion Picture Code Made 'More Flexible' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20johnston&amp;pg=6763%2C3434436 |work=Eugene Register Guard |date=17 December 1956 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington.&lt;ref name=Valenti07p271&gt;{{cite book |author=Jack Valenti |title=This Time, This Place |year=2007 |isbn=9780307346650 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |page=271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke.&lt;ref name=Petersburg63&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston Dies at 66 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-johnston&amp;pg=2746%2C970120 |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=23 August 1963 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.&lt;ref name=MPAAHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpaa.org/about/history |title=History of the MPAA |work=MPAA.org |publisher=Motion Picture Association of America |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621235047/http://www.mpaa.org/about/history |archivedate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA hired [[Jack Valenti]], former aide to President [[Lyndon B.

In 1975 Valenti established the Film Security Office, an anti-piracy division at the MPAA, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films to prevent duplication.&lt;ref name=Clabaugh04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WindsorStar75&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie industry fights film piracy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUU_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DVIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jack%20valenti%20piracy&amp;pg=2594%2C4176001 |work=[[Windsor Star]] |date=14 April 1975 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valenti continued to fight piracy into the 1980s, asking Congress to install chips in VCRs that would prevent illegal reproduction of video cassettes,&lt;ref name=McCloskey86&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie Producers Want Anti-Copy Device On VCR Makers |author=Bill McCloskey |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SJD-HRB0-0011-83BF&amp;csi=304478&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Associated Press |date=23 September 1986 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1990s supported law enforcement efforts to stop [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] distribution of video tapes.&lt;ref name=Billboard91&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Bags Some 50,000 Bogus Vids in N.Y.

===Modern era: 2004–present===
After serving as president of the MPAA for 38 years, Valenti announced that he would step down in 2004.&lt;ref name=BBC04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3861263.stm |title=Hollywood chief Valenti to retire |date=2 July 2004 |work=BBC |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, he was replaced by former [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Dan Glickman]].&lt;ref name="Clabaugh04"/&gt; During his tenure, Glickman focused on tax issues, content protection efforts, and increasing U.S. studios' access to international markets.&lt;ref name=Mullins09&gt;{{cite news |title=Glickman says he'll step down in 2010 |author=Anne Schroeder Mullins |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/politics-politico/glickman-says-hell-step-down-in-2010-362652/ |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led lobbying efforts that resulted in $400 million in federal tax incentives for the movie industry, and also supported a law which created federal oversight of anti-piracy efforts.&lt;ref name=Puzzanghera09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/business/fi-ct-glickman20 |title=Search starts for MPAA chief Dan Glickman's replacement |author1=Jim Puzzanghera |author2=Claudia Eller |date=20 October 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glickman stepped down in 2010.&lt;ref name=Mullins09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandoval10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10439572-93.html |title=MPAA's Dan Glickman steps down |author=Greg Sandoval |date=22 January 2010 |work=CNET |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the MPAA launched the Diversity and Multicultural Outreach program, as part of an effort to increase diversity in the television and film industry both through employment and representation on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusion &amp; Multicultural Outreach|url=https://www.mpaa.org/inclusion-multicultural-outreach/#outreach|publisher=Motion Picture Association of America|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the Diversity and Multicultural and Outreach group has conducted outreach and partnered with more than 20 multicultural groups and national civil rights organizations in sponsoring film screenings, festivals, and other diversity-themed events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Tonya|title=MPAA Partners With "Dope" For American Black Film Festival Opening Night|url=http://madamenoire.com/537798/mpaa-dope-american-black-film-festival-opening-night/|work=MadameNoire|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his tenure at the MPAA, Dodd also highlighted the need for movie studios to embrace technology as a means of distributing content.&lt;ref name=Block11&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Dodd Pushes Back Against Hollywood Vs.

In June 2017, the MPAA supported the launch of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), a coalition of entertainment companies, including the six major studios, [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], that will draw on the MPAA's resources in an effort to reduce online piracy through research and legal efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieberman|first1=David|title=Hollywood And Digital Companies Forge Global Anti-Piracy Alliance|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/hollywood-digital-companies-forge-global-antipiracy-alliance-1202112346/|work=Deadline|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As announced on April 28, 2017, former U.S. Ambassador to France and Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Charles Rivkin succeeded Chris Dodd as CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, effective September 5, 2017, and as chairman, effective December 6, 2017.

==Film rating system==

{{Main|Motion Picture Association of America film rating system}}

In 1968, the MPAA established the Code and Rating Administration, or CARA (later renamed the Classification and Rating Administration), which began issuing ratings for films exhibited and distributed commercially in the United States to help parents determine what films are appropriate for their children.

Since the  [[motion picture rating system|rating system]] was first introduced in November 1968, it has gone through several changes, including the addition of a PG-13 rating.&lt;ref name=Coe68&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Classification Starts Nov. 1 |author=Richard L. Coe |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ujwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ogEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20film%20ratings%20system&amp;pg=7248%2C5548739 |work=Toledo Blade |date=14 October 1968 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Champlin70&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Ratings Plan Will Be Revised |author=Charles Champlin |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WAscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tloEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20film%20ratings%20system&amp;pg=6981%2C4372645 |work=The Victoria Advocate |date=29 January 1970 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings system is completely voluntary, and ratings have no legal standing.&lt;ref name=Lipper90&gt;{{cite news |title=At last, an adult decision |author=Hal Lipper |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SKP-CMT0-0060-215N&amp;csi=11063&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richman03&gt;{{cite news |title=Law limits some violent video games |author=Dan Richman |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Law-limits-some-violent-video-games-1115175.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=20 May 2003 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, theater owners enforce the MPAA film ratings after they have been assigned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CinemaCon: MPAA Tweaks Movie Ratings System in Wake of Newtown School Shooting |author=Pamela McClintock |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cinemacon-mpaa-tweaks-movie-ratings-440392 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many theaters refusing to exhibit non-rated films.&lt;ref name=McClintock12&gt;{{cite news |title=Weinstein Co. to Release Unrated 'Bully' in Protest of 'R' |author=Pamela McClintock |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weinstein-bully-unrated-rated-r-mpaa-304232 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unrated film is often denoted by "NR", such as in newspapers, although this is not a formal MPAA rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel P. |last=Franklin |title=Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States |year=2006 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=9781461641018 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQp4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' alleged that the MPAA gave preferential treatment to member studios during the process of assigning ratings,&lt;ref name=Travers06&gt;{{cite news |title=''This Film Is Not Yet Rated'' |author=Peter Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/this-film-is-not-yet-rated-20060803 |work=Rolling Stone |date=3 August 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency. In response, the MPAA posted its ratings rules, policies, and procedures, as well as its appeals process, online.&lt;ref name=McClintock07&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA, NATO reform ratings system |author=Pamela McClintock |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/mpaa-nato-reform-ratings-system-1117957535/ |work=Variety |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 study commissioned by CARA, ninety-three percent of parents in the U.S. find the rating system to be a helpful tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClintock|first1=Pamela|title=Movie Ratings: Sex Remains Top Concern for American Parents, Not Violence|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/movie-ratings-sex-remains-top-845507|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings currently used by the MPAA's voluntary system are:&lt;ref name=MPAARatings&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mpaa.org/film-ratings/ |title=Film Ratings |work=MPAA.org |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA's concerted efforts at fighting [[copyright infringement]] began in 1975 with the establishment of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication.&lt;ref name="Clabaugh04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WindsorStar75"/&gt; The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of films and TV shows, especially in response to new technologies.

The MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] production and distribution of videos tapes and [[laserdisc]]s into the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Billboard91"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein94&gt;{{cite news |title=Picture This |author=Seth Goldstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA53&amp;dq=MPAA%20laserdiscs&amp;pg=RA1-PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |work=Billboard |date=21 May 1994 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 took successful legal action against individuals posting [[DVD]] [[Digital rights management#DRM and film|decryption software]] on the Internet in [[Universal City Studios, Inc. v.

The MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online.&lt;ref name=Lieberman13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Cheers Prison Sentence For Leader Of Internet Piracy Ring |author=David Lieberman |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/mpaa-imagine-group-justice-department-conviction-sentencing/ |work=Deadline.com |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA and its British counterpart, the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT), also funded the training of [[Lucky and Flo]], a pair of [[Labrador Retrievers]], to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.&lt;ref name=Kirk06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125679/article.html |title=MPAA Trains Dogs to Sniff Out Pirate DVDs |author=Jeremy Kirk |date=11 May 2006 |work=PCWorld |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online file sharing===
In the early 2000s, the MPAA began focusing its efforts to curb copyright infringement specifically on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]], initially using a combination of educational campaigns&lt;ref name=Atkinson03&gt;{{cite news |title=Music piracy persists at Boston U., nationwide despite lawsuits |author=Dan Atkinson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4B6F-HJW0-00K4-105J&amp;csi=172244&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=University Wire |date=10 December 2003 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cease and desist]] letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to [[internet service provider]]s to forward to users engaged in copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=Woolley02&gt;{{cite news |title=Shiver me timbers: Online bootlegs bane of entertainment industry |author=Simon Woolley |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4600-8XW0-015H-052Y&amp;csi=244819&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Townsville Bulletin/Townsville Sun |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including [[BitTorrent]] and [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]].&lt;ref name=Locklear04&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2004/12/4467-2/ |title=MPAA lawsuits target BitTorrent, eDonkey and Direct Connect networks |author=Fred Locklear |date=14 December 2004 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.&lt;ref name=Johnson05&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Anti-Piracy Lawsuits Target Individuals |author=Bary Alyssa Johnson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4H0K-M4X0-01KX-14V2&amp;csi=262320&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=PC Magazine |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA also played a role in encouraging the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] to conduct [[the Pirate Bay raid|a raid of the Pirate Bay]] file-sharing website in May 2006.&lt;ref name=Mennecke06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story1227.html |title=Sweden Pressured to take Pirate Bay Action |author=Thomas Mennecke |date=20 June 2006 |work=Slyck.com |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the [[World Trade Organization]], along with a letter from the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Ahrens06&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Joins Industry in Piracy War |author=Frank Ahrens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061402071.html |work=The Washington Post |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewing06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/4128/20060621/#.UTdo1nyY4RE |title=US threatened Sweden with sanctions over piracy |author=Adam Ewing |date=21 June 2006 |work=The Local |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Center for Copyright Information]] unveiled the [[Copyright Alert System]], a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and five of the USA's largest [[internet service providers]].&lt;ref name=Miller13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA-Backed Copyright Alert System Unveiled |author=Sean J. Miller |url=http://www.backstage.com/news/mpaa-backed-copyright-alert-system-unveiled/ |work=Back Stage |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system used a third-party service to identify content being distributed illegally. Users were then informed that their accounts were being used for possible copyright infringement and were provided with information about ways to get authorized content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new copyright alert system is running |author=Sarah Laskow |url=http://www.cjr.org/cloud_control/cas_system_already_in_action.php?page=all |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users who received multiple notices of infringement faced "mitigations measures," such as temporary slowing of their Internet service, but the system did not include termination of subscriber accounts. Subscribers facing such action had a right to appeal to the [[American Arbitration Association]].&lt;ref name=CASFAQs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/ |title=Copyright Alert System FAQs |work=copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the Copyright Alert System was discontinued.  While no official reason was given, the MPAA's general counsel stated that the system had not been equipped to stop repeat infringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=Internet Service Providers, Studios and Record Labels Call It Quits on Copyright Alert System|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/copyright-alerts-piracy-mpaa-comcast-att-1201971756/|work=Variety|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2014, the [[Sony Pictures hack]] revealed that following a lawsuit in which the MPAA won a multimillion judgment against [[Hotfile]], a file hosting website, the MPAA colluded with Hotfile to misrepresent the settlement so that the case would serve as a deterrent. The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van der Sar|first1=Ernesto|title=MPAA Secretly Settled With Hotfile for $4 Million, Not $80 Million|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-secretly-settled-hotfile-4-million-80-million-141224/|work=Torrentfreak|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/sony-email-leak-has-uncovered-the-truth-behind-mpaa-and-hotfile-dispute|title=Sony email leak has uncovered the truth behind MPAA and Hotfile dispute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141224/06321429517/sony-hack-reveals-that-mpaas-big-80-million-settlement-with-hotfile-was-lie.shtml|title=Sony Hack Reveals That MPAA's Big '$80 Million' Settlement With Hotfile Was A Lie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the [[United States International Trade Commission]] (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as "articles" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=With the MPAA Watching, ITC Says Case About Teeth Won't Bring Down the Internet|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mpaa-watching-itc-says-case-775397|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=MPAA Warns Appellate Ruling Could Limit Ability to Fight Digital Piracy|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/mpaa-digital-goods-piracy-google-1201637501/|work=Variety|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the MPAA reported [[Putlocker]] as one of the "top 5 rogue cyberlocker services" to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |date=31 March 2012 |title=MPAA wants more criminal cases brought against 'rogue' sites |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/mpaa-wants-more-criminal-cases-brought-against-rogue-sites/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Prabhu |first=Vijay |date=17 October 2016 |title=Yet Another Video Streaming Service Bites The Dust, Putlocker Shuts Down |url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/10/putlocker-video-streaming-service-shuts.html |publisher=TechWorm |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bolton |first=Doug |date=26 May 2016 |title=Putlocker blocked in the UK by internet service providers after High Court order |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/putlocker-blocked-down-virgin-media-sky-internet-streaming-watch-online-videos-a7050056.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
===Publicity campaigns===
The MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The ''[[Who Makes Movies?]]'' advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements.&lt;ref name=Boliek03&gt;{{cite news |title=H'wood steps up antipiracy fight |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BG8-SXP0-01V4-X35T&amp;csi=12015&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan "[[You can click, but you can't hide]]". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action.&lt;ref name=BBC05&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4256449.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Hernandez04&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Files Piracy Suits |author=Greg Hernandez |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4DTP-V1K0-TWDH-T3C9&amp;csi=157105&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Daily News of Los Angeles |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the [[Intellectual Property Office of Singapore]] to release [[You Wouldn't Steal a Car|a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft]].&lt;ref name=IPOS04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |title=Be HIP at the Movies |author= |date=27 July 2004 |work=Intellectual Property Office of Singapore |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924044120/http://www1.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.&lt;ref name=Rohrer09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8106805.stm |title=Getting inside a downloader's head |author=Finlo Rohrer |date=18 June 2009 |work=BBC |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.&lt;ref name=Pope08&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA admits mistake on downloading study |author=Justin Pope |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |work=Newsweek |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207045516/http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's "I Make Movies" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=MPAA to Run 'I Make Movies' Ads at AMC Theaters, Local Cinema Chains|url=https://www.thewrap.com/mpaa-to-run-i-make-movies-ads-at-amc-theaters-local-cinema-chains/|work=The Wrap|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's "WhereToWatch" website (later dubbed "The Credits")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecredits.org/|website=mpaa.org|title=The Credits|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.

===Accusations of copyright infringement===
The MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a [[Blog software|blogging platform]] called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA: We Were Only Testing Forest Blog|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-we-were-only-testing-forest-blog|work=Torrentfreak|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |title=MPAA violates software license |author=Brett Thomas |date=19 February 2007 |work=bit-tech.net |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110183631/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux]] distribution, released under the [[GNU General Public License|General Public License]], which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.&lt;ref name=Paul07&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA's University Toolkit hit with DMCA takedown notice after GPL violation |author=Ryan Paul |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/12/mpaas-university-toolkit-hit-with-dmca-takedown-notice-after-gpl-violation/ |work=Ars Technica |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its [[MPAA film rating system|rating system]])&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060130093854/http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/cl-et-mpaa24jan24,0,2188275.story MPAA finds itself accused of piracy], by John Horn; at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (via [[archive.org]]); published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; — an act which ''[[Ars Technica]]'' explicitly described as [[hypocrisy]]&lt;ref name=ArsTech&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/01/6036-2/ MPAA admits to unauthorized movie copying], by Eric Bangeman, at ''[[Ars Technica]]''; published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and which [[Roger Ebert]] called "rich irony".&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/sundance-7-film-ratings-exposed Sundance #7: Film ratings exposed!], by [[Roger Ebert]]; at [[RogerEbert.com]]; published January 26, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

'''''Mystical Marriage of St Catherine and Saints''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Lorenzo Lotto]], signed, now in the Collections of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica ([[Palazzo Barberini]]), [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

==Description==
The work was commissioned by the merchant Felice Cassotti from Lotto while the latter was working in Bergamo. The painting hung in the nuptial bedroom of Cassotti's son. The work is signed on the Madonna's throne. The painting once hung in the [[Palazzo Quirinale]].

Lotto in 1523 had painted a portrait of the married couple, Marsilio Cassotti and Faustina Assonica, a work now on display in the [[Prado Museum]]. In this depiction of the [[Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine|mystical marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], the saint kneeling accepts from the child Jesus a rose, the latter symbol of love and martyrdom; in her left hand is a marital ring. Hanging from a sash is a purse with the name of Christ; the sash has a medallion with an angel holding a balance. Around these figures are St Jerome paging his bible, with lion at the feet (left lower corner); St George dressed as a knight with his lance (left upper corner); beside him hovering behind the Virgin is St Sebastian with an arrow; Saint Nicholas of Myra with a bishop's crozier with three gold spheres, conversing with St Anthony Abbot with bells (right upper corner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/103/lotto-sposalizio-mistico-di-santa-caterina-e-santi Galleria Barberini], entry on painting.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other Lotto paintings, the figures seem engaged in movement.

The '''Praetorians Relief''' is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] marble relief dated to {{circa|51–52}} AD and housed in the [[Louvre-Lens]].&lt;ref name="afa"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.afaweb.org/exhibitions/details/documents/HighlightsofRomanArtfromtheLouvre.pdf| title =Highlights of Roman art from the Louvre|publisher =[[American Federation of Arts]]| page=3|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts three soldiers in [[Relief#High relief|high relief]] in the foreground, while two others in the background, accompanied by a standard bearer, are made in [[bas-relief]]. The standard-bearer holds an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila standard]], where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons. The soldiers have been identified as [[Praetorians]] due to the richness of the apparel, particularly the helmets, the ceremonial dress and oval shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Lawrence Keppie | title =The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire| publisher =University of Oklahoma Press | year =1998 | pages =233–234 | isbn =0806130148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are wearing [[calcei]] and not [[caligae]], worn by ordinary soldiers. However, according to [[Boris Rankov]], "the [[Attic helmet|Attic-style helmets]] are almost certainly an artistic convention".&lt;ref name="Rankov"&gt;{{cite book | author =Boris Rankov | title =The Praetorian Guard| publisher =Osprey Publishing | year =1994 | page =20 | isbn =1855323613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankov suggests that "early in their history the Praetorians were still using the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmet]] normal in the [[Roman legion|legions]] of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]".&lt;ref name="Rankov"/&gt;

The relief was previously dated to the early 2nd century AD. The lower half of the left-hand figure, portions of the middle two and the heads of all three foreground figures are modern restorations. In 2006 the relief underwent restoration by N. Imbert and A. Méthivier.&lt;ref name="Ancientrome"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ancientrome.ru/art/artwork/img.htm?id=2537| script-title=ru:Рельеф с преторианцами |publisher =Ancientrome.ru| language=Russian|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The Praetorians Relief was once part of the [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]], erected in 51 to commemorate the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]].&lt;ref name="afa"/&gt; The relief is mentioned already in the 16th century. The head of the standard-bearer is depicted in ''Album'' by [[Pierre Jacques de Reims]], on the page dated to 1577.&lt;ref name="Ancientrome"/&gt; The relief was once in the possession of the [[Mattei family]], in 1824 it was purchased by the French.

[[File:Firmas de Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Signatures by Rembrandt published by the Rembrandt Research Project.]]
The '''Rembrandt Research Project''' (RRP) is an initiative of the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO), which is the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. Its purpose is to organize and categorize research on [[Rembrandt]], with the aim of discovering new facts about this [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter and his studio. The project was started in 1968, but has since become the authority on Rembrandt and has final say in whether a painting is ''genuine''.

==Results==
As a result of the project, which analyzed documentation, techniques, and forensic research on Rembrandt paintings from his early years in [[Leiden]] until his death, the number of signed Rembrandt ''self-portraits'' around the world has been reduced by half. Also, more paintings have been attributed to [[List of Rembrandt pupils|students working in the Rembrandt studio]], and more has been discovered about the ways in which the students worked. Recently, period copies of Rembrandt paintings are being studied for clues as to whether certain copies were factory-style pieces for visiting functionaries. Rembrandt's work was in high demand for decades, and he managed to keep productivity up while also keeping his prices high by enforcing strict quality control on the work done in his studio.

The project's six-volume publication, ''A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings'', is considered the definitive authority by all auction houses and dealers who work with works by Rembrandt and his studio. The research project has proved invaluable to art historians, and the lack of such a project for other prominent Dutch painters such as [[Frans Hals]] is felt sorely by museums and collectors trying to acquire the same sort of ''stamp of approval'' on their paintings.  However, the project has also initiated debate about the feasibility of conclusive attribution, particularly for painters who were associated with one or more workshops.

===Old man with turban===
In 1998, the pAn Amsterdam art fair showed a Rembrandt for the first time that until then had been attributed to his pupil [[Jacques des Rousseaux]]. This painting was first cataloged in 1917 by [[Abraham Bredius]], who accepted it as a Rembrandt. Later [[Kurt Bauch]] rejected this based on a photograph and attributed it to [[Jan Lievens]] without ever having seen the painting. [[Werner Sumowski]] re-attributed the painting based on photographs to Rousseaux as a rebuttal to the arguments by art historians Bauch, [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Horst Gerson]].&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;Catalog [http://www.pan.nl/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=58&amp;lg=nl pAn Amsterdam] 1998, p.11-17&lt;/ref&gt; The Rembrandt Research project seeks to avoid such arguments by making attributions based on historical and forensic evidence. The study of Rembrandt's oevre includes study of drawings and etchings as well as paintings by a wide range of artists who were Rembrandt's contemporaries. Analysis of his techniques includes the study of paints and panel wood he and his contemporaries used, while x-rays of paintings reveal whether a painting is a copy based on the amount of "discovery" drawing in the underlayer.

The pAn 1998 catalog contains an article by [[Ernst van de Wetering]] with foto's of other depictions of the same man by [[Jan Lievens]], [[Gerard Dou]], and Jacques Rousseau (thus the mis-attribution). The man has clearly the same face in all four portraits.

====Rembrandt's father====
According to Van de Wetering, this is the man often referred to as ''Rembrandt's father'', who was probably not his father, but a functionary in the [[Leiden Guild of St. Luke|Leiden painters' guild]] or male model.&lt;ref name=catalog /&gt;

==End==
In early 2011, the RRP board voted to terminate the project by the end of 2011 even though approximately one-quarter of Rembrandt's oeuvre has not yet been investigated.  A major reason for this decision was the lack of scholars available to assume responsibilities from the RRP's chair, [[Ernst van de Wetering]], who has been involved with the project since 1968.  Other reasons cited included lack of funding, as the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] ceased funding the project in 1998.  However, with funding from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] and the [[Mauritshuis]] have launched a pilot initiative called the [http://www.rembrandtdatabase.org/ Rembrandt Database] that will build off of and supplement research from the RRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926052740/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |archive-date=2011-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlioz- Roméo et Juliette - Handbill - Holoman p201.jpg|thumb|300px|Handbill advertising the first performance]]
'''''Roméo et Juliette''''' is a ''symphonie dramatique,'' a large-scale [[choral symphony]] by French [[composer]] [[Hector Berlioz]], which was first performed on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1839. The [[libretto]] was written by [[Émile Deschamps]], and the completed work was assigned the catalogue numbers [[Opus number|Op.]] 17 and [[D. Kern Holoman|H.]] 79. It is based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''; it is regarded as one of Berlioz's finest works, and it is among the most original in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Julian Rushton]]|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521377676|title=Berlioz: Roméo et Juliette|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|series=Cambridge Music Handbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score is Berlioz's most comprehensive and detailed [[Program music|programmatic]] piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carringbush.net/~pml/music/berlioz/#h.79 CarringBush.net Berlioz page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605131207/http://www.carringbush.net/~pml/music/berlioz/ |date=2008-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Genesis===

Initial inspiration came from a performance he witnessed in 1827 of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (in [[David Garrick]]'s edited version) at the [[Odéon|Odéon Theatre]] in Paris. The cast included [[Harriet Smithson]], who also inspired Berlioz's ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''. In his ''Memoirs'', Berlioz describes the electrifying effect of the drama:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... to steep myself in the fiery sun and balmy nights of Italy, to witness the drama of that passion swift as thought, burning as lava, radiantly pure as an angel's glance, imperious, irresistible, the raging vendettas, the desperate kisses, the frantic strife of love and death, was more than I could bear. By the third act, scarcely able to breathe&amp;mdash;it was as though an iron hand had gripped me by the heart&amp;mdash;I knew that I was lost. I may add that at the time I did not know a word of English; I could only glimpse Shakespeare darkly through the mists of Letourneur's translation; the splendour of the poetry which gives a whole new glowing dimension to his glorious works was lost on me. ... But the power of the acting, especially that of Juliet herself, the rapid flow of the scenes, the play of expression and voice and gesture, told me more and gave me a far richer awareness of the ideas and passions of the original than the words of my pale and garbled translation could do.&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns (2002), pp. 72&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The range of feeling and mood as well as poetic and formal invention which Berlioz found in Shakespeare&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/philharmonic/learning/berlioz.shtml |title="Meet the Phil" – ''Romeo and Juliet'' – Berlioz" (6 April 2006). BBC Philharmonic website |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226151953/http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/philharmonic/learning/berlioz.shtml |archivedate=26 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; had a strong influence on his music, making a direct musical setting of Shakespeare's work only natural. In fact, he had been planning a musical realisation of ''Romeo and Juliet'' for a long time before 1838, but other projects intervened.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2007/aboutmusic/p23_berlioz.shtml BBC Proms | About the Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226152551/http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2007/aboutmusic/p23_berlioz.shtml |date=2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emile Deschamps (the [[libretto|librettist]] of the work) says that he and Berlioz worked out a plan for the symphony shortly after the Odéon's 1827/28 season. Indeed, it may be the case that ''Roméo et Juliette'''s genesis is intertwined with other works composed before the composer left for his [[Prix de Rome]] sojourn of 1830 to 1832. ''[[Prix de Rome Cantatas (Berlioz)|Sardanapale]]'', the cantata with which Berlioz finally won the Prix de Rome in 1830, includes the melodic material of both the ''Roméo seul'' ("Romeo alone") portion of the second movement and the ''Grande fête chez Capulet'' ("Great banquet at the Capulets").&lt;ref name="pn"&gt;[http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Berlioz2003/ProgNotes/079R&amp;Jnote.htm ''Roméo et Juliette'' programme notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114095707/http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Berlioz2003/ProgNotes/079R%26Jnote.htm |date=2008-01-14 }} Public domain: [http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Berlioz2003/ProgNotes/00NotesTP.html see here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114095702/http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Berlioz2003/ProgNotes/00NotesTP.html |date=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is abundant evidence that Berlioz was gradually working out a scheme for ''Roméo et Juliette'' during his sojourn in Italy. He reviewed a February 1831 performance in [[Florence]] of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'', outlining in passing how he would compose music for the ''Roméo et Juliette'' story: it would feature, he says, the sword fight, a concert of love, Mercutio's piquant buffooning, the terrible catastrophe, and the solemn oath of the two rival families. One line of text from the review eventually shows up in the libretto of the symphony.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt;

===Realization===

The eventual composition of ''Roméo et Juliette'' as we know it now was made possible by the generous gift of 20,000 [[French franc|francs]] by [[Niccolò Paganini]]; after hearing a performance of ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] on 16 December 1838, the great [[virtuoso]] had publicly knelt before [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and hailed him as the heir of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. Paganini died shortly after, and did not read or hear the piece. Berlioz used the money primarily to repay his debts, and afterwards was still left with "a handsome sum of money", which he used to allow himself to put his full focus towards working on "a really important work", unobstructed by his usual time-consuming obligations as a [[critic]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns (2002), pp. 240&amp;ndash;246.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz finished the score on 8 September 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1999), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work's libretto is not sourced from the original plays, and as a result contains changes from Shakespeare's play, both in the version Berlioz worked from, and subsequent cuts he and his librettist made. Berlioz's composition was heavily influenced by the play he had seen acted by [[Charles Kemble]] and Harriet Smithson in 1827, which had been rewritten by the 18th century actor [[David Garrick]] to have Juliet awaken from her deathlike sleep before Romeo's death from (a much slower acting) poison. Berlioz enlisted the services of author Emile Deschamps to write the libretto. Between them they also left out the character of the nurse and expanded Shakespeare's brief mention of the two families' reconciliation into a substantial vocal finale.&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt;

Berlioz developed a special predilection for the symphony over his career, writing in his memoirs that one movement in particular became a favorite: "If you now ask me which of my pieces I prefer, my answer will be that I share the view of most artists: I prefer the adagio (the Love Scene) in ''Romeo and Juliet''."&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns (2002), p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

From composition until the first performance, [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s time was occupied with physical arrangements for the premiere: parts were copied, chorus parts [[lithograph]]ed, and rehearsals got underway. The [[bass-baritone]], [[Adolphe-Louis Alizard]] (Friar Lawrence), and the ''Prologue'' [[choir|chorus]], all of whom came from the [[Paris Opéra]], were prepared during the intermissions of performances there.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt; There was much anticipation in Paris prior to the first performance. In the rehearsals, Berlioz pioneered the practice of orchestral sectionals, rehearsing the different sections of the orchestra separately to better prepare them for the challenging piece. This was followed by two full orchestra rehearsals to polish up the details.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt;

It was first performed in three concerts conducted by Berlioz at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] with an orchestra of 100 instruments and 101 voices&lt;ref&gt;Holoman (1989), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 November, 1 December and 15 December 1839, before capacity audiences that comprised much of the Parisian [[intelligentsia]]. Another notable audience member was [[Richard Wagner]], who would later note the influence of the symphony on his opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.&lt;ref name="pr" /&gt; Reactions to the piece were quite varied, as could be expected for a radical work. However, it was widely acknowledged that Berlioz had scored a major triumph in these first performances; a "tour de force such as only my system of sectional rehearsals could have achieved".&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt; Berlioz comments: "The work as it was then [in 1839] was performed three times at the Conservatoire under my direction and, each time, appeared to be a genuine success. But I felt at once that much would have to be changed, and I went over it carefully and critically from every point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns (2002), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to revise the work, a few instances upon the suggestions of critics, but generally by his own judgement.

A premiere of a later revision (including cuts and changes to the ''Prologue'', ''Queen Mab Scherzo'', and the ''Finale'') was held in [[Vienna]] on 2 January 1846, the first performance since 1839 and the first abroad. After hearing a complete performance in Vienna on 26 January 1846, Berlioz took the opportunity to make major revisions before a performance scheduled for the following April in [[Prague]]. He accepted advice from several confidants and advisers, rewriting the [[coda (music)|coda]] of the ''Queen Mab Scherzo'', shortening Friar Laurence's narrative at the end, deleting a lengthy second ''Prologue'' at the beginning of the second half, and introducing musical foreshadowing in the first prologue.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt; The full score was not published until 1847.&lt;ref name="hb"&gt;[http://www.hberlioz.com/Scores/sromeo.htm HBerlioz.com | Berlioz reference site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the first performances, Berlioz commented in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The work is enormously difficult to perform. It poses problems of every kind, problems inherent in the form and in the style and only to be solved by long and patient rehearsal, impeccably directed. To be well done, it needs first-rate performers&amp;mdash;players, singers, conductor&amp;mdash;intent on preparing it with as much care as a new opera is prepared in a good opera house, in fact almost as if it were to be performed by heart.&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns (2002), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The [[Sheet music|score]] calls for:
*[[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s, 4 [[bassoon]]s
*4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[cornet]]s, 2 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[bass tuba]]
*2 pairs of [[timpani]], 2 [[snare drum]]s, [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[crotales]]
*2 [[harp]]s
*[[String section|strings]]

==Music==
Structurally and musically, ''Roméo et Juliette'' is most indebted to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th symphony]] – not just due to the use of soloists and [[choir]], but in factors such as the weight of the vocal contribution being in the finale, and also in aspects of the orchestration such as the theme of the [[trombone]] recitative at the ''Introduction''.&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt; The roles of Roméo and Juliette are represented by the [[orchestra]], and the narrative aspects by the voices. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s reasoning follows:

&lt;!--It is a bit over the top not to abbreviate the following quote, but it is so beautifully poetic that I cannot manage to do that--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If, in the famous garden and cemetery scenes, the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's [[aside]]s, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons for this are numerous and easy to understand. First, and this reason alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been treated vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;[http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Berlioz2003/Texts/79R&amp;JObs.htm ''Roméo et Juliette'': Berlioz's Avant-propos and Observations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vocal forces are used sparingly throughout, until they are fully deployed in the finale.&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt; The exceptional virtuosity deployed in the orchestral writing seems particularly appropriate for the dedicatee of the work, Paganini himself,&lt;!--Paganini however, was not a virtuoso orchestrator--&gt; who was never able to hear it, much to Berlioz's regret.&lt;ref name="hb"/&gt; Further examples of Berlioz's inventiveness are shown in the use of thematic links throughout the piece, somewhat laying the ground for the Wagnerian [[leitmotif]], for example the last solo notes of the [[oboe]] which follow Juliet's suicide echo a phrase from the earlier funeral procession when she was thought to be dead.&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt; Berlioz signed and dated his autograph on 8 September 1839.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt; The final score was dedicated to Paganini.&lt;ref name="kc"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=3150 Programme notes], [[Kennedy Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stylistic links of the work with Beethoven before (and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] after) could not be stronger. From Beethoven, Berlioz learned the very notion of programmatic music. He saw in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral symphony]] how music might be depictive without being naïve, in the symphonic [[scherzo|scherzi]] how the delicate ''[[Queen Mab]]'' might best be evoked, and in the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th symphony]] how effective a choral finale could be. He sensed Beethoven's flexibility with regard to number of movements and the performing force.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt;

==Influence==

From ''Roméo et Juliette'' [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] absorbed so much about the ideals of dramatic music that the work can be considered a major influence on ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''. When Wagner first heard the work in 1839 he said it made him feel like a schoolboy at [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s side. ''Roméo et Juliette'' was also the work of Berlioz's that Wagner knew best. Indeed, their second and last meeting was on the occasion of a performance of the work in London in 1855. Wagner learned something of melodic flexibility and perhaps even a mastery of the orchestral force from Berlioz. He may have absorbed more specific features: the close relationship of the first few bars of the [[Tristan chord|''Tristan'' prelude]] to the opening of the second movement of ''Roméo et Juliette'' has been suggested.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt; Moreover, in 1860, he sent Berlioz the published full score of ''Tristan und Isolde'' inscribed merely:

&lt;poem lang="fr" style="float:left;"&gt;Au grand et cher auteur de
''Roméo et Juliette''
L'auteur reconnaissant de
''Tristan et Isolde''.&lt;ref name="pn"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;(To the great and dear author of
''Romeo and Juliet''
from the grateful author of
''Tristan and Isolde''.)&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1999), p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;{{Clear|left}}

Beyond the influence on Wagner's music drama, the piece pushed the limits of the contemporary orchestra's capabilities, in terms of colour, [[program music|programmatic]] scope and individual virtuosity. While this applies to much of Berlioz's music, it is even more true for ''Roméo et Juliette'', written at the height of his powers and ambition. Its vivid scene-setting surpasses many [[opera]]s, which constitutes an enormous success on Berlioz's part. [[Franz Liszt]] also recognised the significance of Berlioz as a progressive composer, and championed his music.

'''Rūta Society''' ({{lang-lt|Vilniaus lietuvių kultūros draugija „Rūta“}}) was a [[Lithuania]]n cultural society in [[Vilnius]] (Vilna, Wilno), then part of the [[Russian Empire]], active from 1909 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914. It organized various events, including lectures, literary evenings, and musical performances, but it is most noted for its contribution to the development of the Lithuanian theater. In total, Rūta staged about 50 plays.&lt;ref name=baski/&gt;

==History and choir==
The official permission to establish Rūta was received on 25 September 1908 and the founding meeting took place on 11 January 1909.&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; At that time the society registered 66 members and elected a 12-member board, which included {{illm|Jonas Masiulis|lt}} (chairman), {{illm|Andrius Domaševičius|lt}} (vice-chairman), [[Mykolas Sleževičius]] (secretary), [[Jonas Basanavičius]], {{illm|Jurgis Šlapelis|lt}}.&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; The membership dues were set at a minimum of four [[Russian rubles|rubles]] per year.&lt;ref name=griga/&gt; Sleževičius was the main driving force behind the society – he established a cultural society of the same name as a law student at the [[Odessa University]]. During the first year, the number of members grew to 192&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; and the society held 33 evenings (mostly dance) and four lectures.&lt;ref name=griga/&gt;

The society had a group for singers, dancers, music players, and theater performers.&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; Most performances were open to the public. The society had a choir (about 50 members) which performed works by Lithuanian composers ([[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis]], [[Juozas Naujalis]], [[Mikas Petrauskas]], [[Česlovas Sasnauskas]], [[Stasys Šimkus]])&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; as well as foreign composers ([[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Jules Massenet]]).&lt;ref name=povil/&gt; In 1910, a Latvian subsidiary of the [[Gramophone Company]] recorded ''[[Tautiška giesmė]]'' and eight other patriotic songs.&lt;ref name=patef/&gt;&lt;ref name=nakie/&gt; The singers were little trained – their voices were loud but enthusiastic.&lt;ref name=nakie/&gt; Another recording of 20 songs by Lithuanian composers was made in 1914.&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; Together with a [[symphonic orchestra]], the choir performed [[cantata]] "De profundis" by Čiurlionis in 1913.&lt;ref name=manel/&gt;  

==Theater==
The theater group with [[Mykolas Sleževičius]] was particularly active.&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; It also included {{illm|Gabrielius Landsbergis-Žemkalnis|lt}}, [[Antanas Žmuidzinavičius]], and others.&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; The [[Backdrop (theater)|backdrop]] was painted by [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis]] in June 1909. It has survived and is preserved at the [[M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum]]&lt;ref name=limis/&gt; and commemorated by a fresco inside the former theater of Rūta.&lt;ref name=jakim/&gt; The group, which was active even before Rūta was officially organized, staged several plays, most notably historical dramas ''Mindaugis, Lietuvos karalius'' by [[Juliusz Słowacki]] (''[[Mindaugas]], [[King of Lithuania]]''; premiered on 27 April 1908) and ''Živilė, duktė Karijoto'' by Vincas Nagornoskis (''Živilė, Daughter of [[Karijotas]]''; premiered on 4 January 1909).&lt;ref name=prusi/&gt; The plays had to be approved by Russian censors who diligently removed any anti-Russian sentiments.&lt;ref name=avizi/&gt; As a result, many plays were significantly cut. For example, ''Živilė, duktė Karijoto'' lost the entire first section and many scenes.&lt;ref name=avizi/&gt; 

The theater shift from simple comedies to historical dramas revealed limitations of the amateur theater and the need of a professional Lithuanian theater.&lt;ref name=trink03/&gt; To that end, in September 1910, the theater group separated from Rūta and joined the theater group of the Lithuanian Mutual Relief Society of Vilnius (''Vilniaus lietuvių savitarpinės pašalpos draugija'') to form an independent Lithuanian Artists' Union of Vilnius (''Vilniaus lietuvių artistų sąjunga'') which two years later established the first [[theater company]].&lt;ref name=trink15/&gt; The union and the company closely cooperated with Rūta and staged many new plays. Lithuanian activists hoped that it would become the basis for the professional Lithuanian theater, but it faced financial difficulties and internal disagreements, paid no heed to theater education and hoped that practice would be enough.&lt;ref name=trink15/&gt; The last play, modernist ''The Snow'' by [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]], was performed on 10 May 1914. Further activities were disrupted by World War I.&lt;ref name=trink15/&gt;

'''Scandinavia''' has a long and proud tradition of '''rug-making''' on par with many of the regions of the world that are perhaps more immediately associated with the craft—regions such as [[Chinese rug|China]] and [[Persian rug|Persia]]. Rugs have been handmade by craftspeople in the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden for centuries, and have often played important cultural roles in each of these countries. Contemporary Scandinavian rugs—most especially [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Swedish rugs]]—are among the most sought after rugs in the world today, largely due to the contributions of designers like Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom.&lt;ref name="mmf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmf.se/html_en/index2.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222013619/http://www.mmf.se/html_en/index2.htm |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |website=Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom AB|title=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Scandinavian rugs is a vital chapter in the cultural study of Scandinavia, as it reveals a great deal about the aesthetic and social conventions of that region.

== History ==
The history of [[rug-making]] in [[Scandinavia]] is complex. Indeed, the history of how artisanal rug-making became a cultural institution throughout Scandinavia is very much the history of how the craft spread throughout the whole of [[Europe]], from its origins as a traditional Eastern art form. Indeed, the rug-makers of Scandinavia – like many of their other European counterparts – were heavily influenced by the aesthetics as well as the manufacturing techniques of the rug-makers of [[Anatolia]] and [[Asia Minor]], with whom the Scandinavians of the [[Early Middle Ages]] had considerable contact via international trade routes. By the tenth century of the [[Common Era]], Scandinavians were trading extensively with the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Constantinople]], creating a considerable interest in fine rugs throughout Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Textiles: A Concise History (World of Art)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the right and twelfth centuries of the Common Era, a large preponderance of traditionally made Byzantine rugs were brought into Northern Europe – including into the Scandinavian Kingdoms of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Nazmiyal Swedish Rugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/vintage/swedish/ |title=Swedish Rugs &amp;#124; Vintage Swedish Kilims and Rug Collection |website=Nazmiyalantiquerugs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of those countries' harsh climate, which frequently counts among the coldest and bitterest winters anywhere on Earth, the expertly crafted rugs of the Byzantines fit right in: the best Byzantine rugs were often hung in stately homes for insulation purposes and were frequently used as blankets by Scandinavian noblemen.&lt;ref name="Scandinavian Rugs History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artiesa.com/origins/scandinavian-rugs/ |title=Scandinavian Rugs |website=Artiesa.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles" /&gt; For a long time, it was this arrangement that dominated in Scandinavia: Oriental rugs were brought in from the Eastern Empire into Scandinavia, with very few original pieces actually being woven in Scandinavia. However, after centuries of exposure to fine Oriental rugs, the people of Scandinavia began to develop their own distinct style of artisanal rug-making.

By the fourteenth century A.D., Scandinavians had developed the art of the [[Rya (rug)|Rya]] (or Ryijy).&lt;ref name="Nazmiyal: Swedish Rugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/vintage/swedish/ |title=Swedish Rugs &amp;#124; Vintage Swedish Kilims and Rug Collection |website=Nazmiyalantiquerugs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These distinctive rugs represented a new development in the art form that told the story of the artisans responsible for them: unlike the Oriental rugs of the Eastern Empire to which the Scandinavians had become accustomed, Ryas were made thick with shaggy, long pile: these rugs were specifically engineered to help the Scandinavian people weather their notoriously harsh winters. Soon after their development, Ryas were everywhere in [[Middle Ages]] Scandinavia, often replacing traditional Oriental rugs as well as cloaks and blankets. Splendid examples of this sort of tug have been found at archaeological excavations of old [[Viking]] settlements, most notably in [[York, England]].&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles" /&gt;

In addition to serving as wall coverings and blankets for noblemen and commoners alike, traditional Ryas were also used in marriage ceremonies throughout Scandinavia, throughout the Middle Ages. Ryas woven for such occasions are very distinct pieces, often featuring the initials of the bride and the groom, the date of the wedding ceremony, a set of double hearts, and symbols and signs that represented the groom’s and the bride’s families. Wedding Ryas were extremely important, and perhaps represent the most distinct development in Scandinavian rug-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SWEDISH TEXTILE ART: Traditional Marriage Weavings from Scania (The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Swedish Textile Art) |edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Even as the Scandinavian rug-making tradition matured from the 1500s through the 1800s, more traditionally Oriental themes were incorporated into the finest Scandinavian rugs, with the [[Tree of Life]] motif featuring most prominently. A standby in Persian rugs, the Tree of Life symbol was adapted by the rug-makers of Scandinavia to represent family trees and ties.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

By the 1880s, traditional Scandinavian rugs – and, most especially, Ryas – were hugely popular throughout [[northern Europe]]. In addition, Sweden had begun to produce a very distinctive style of rug, the Rollakan. These pieces were generally flat-woven rugs bedecked with elaborate tapestry art, making them very distinctive from the generally abstract, thick-piled Ryas – even as they were used for similar purposes.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

From humble beginnings, the craft of rug-making in Scandinavia has blossomed into a complex art form with various outlets for craftspeople to explore. And though Rya rugs fell out of favor with the nobles of Scandinavia and were subsequently relegated to the domain of [[folk art]],{{when|date=June 2016}}{{cn|date=June 2016}} there was a massive explosion in the popularity of the traditional Rya rug in the middle years of the twentieth century – a phenomenon that continues on today.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

Ryas had been made with abstract, geometric designs for centuries, and had always been made with thick shaggy pile. This design style was particularly appealing to the [[modernist]] designers of mid-twentieth-century Europe and [[North America]], who felt that shaggy, colorful carpets worked well to offset the harsher and colder design elements that dominated their own aesthetic: in a home with many straight lines, hard woods, and metals, the soft and colorful design style of Rya rugs gave a sense of warmth and color that often worked to create a homier house. Designers as influential as [[Ray Eames]], [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], were all known to enjoy the effect of a traditional Scandinavian rug.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

== Rug making techniques ==


The art of rug-making is ancient and extraordinarily complex – not to mention culturally significant to the peoples among whom such traditions developed. The complicated lists of knot-types and weaving techniques long employed by the master weavers of China and Persia are indicative of the importance of rug-making to those cultures. Though rug-making came to Scandinavia notably later than it did to traditional rug-making cultures in the Eastern world, an equally complex and sophisticated methodology for weaving fine rugs did develop in those northern European countries. {{cn|date=June 2016}} 

Rya rugs, for example, are woven with a combination of techniques that include weaving tapestry, needlework, and carpet knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal and Village Rugs: The Definitive Guide to Design, Pattern &amp; Motif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Scandinavian Rya rugs were hand-made by artisans who would add symmetric [[Turkish knot|Turkish (or Ghiordes) knots]] directly to the warp through a specially woven backing. Small holes in the weave allowed the rug-makers to insert evenly spaced knots using a larger tapestry needle.{{cn|date=June 2016}}  

Unlike many other culturally important rugs, Ryas were used with the pile facing downward, the better to insulate the wearer. As such, design elements and  ornamentation were woven into the back of the rugs, with the pile consisting of solid colors. Over time, this was reversed, creating the colorful Ryas that caught the eye of the mid-twentieth century designers who did so much to popularize them.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

It is difficult to talk about the history and style of Scandinavian rugs without mentioning Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom. One of the most important figures in the entire history of Scandinavian rug-making, Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom was a mid-twentieth century rug designer whose pieces are among the most noteworthy rugs ever designed.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;  Working from 1919 until her death in 1941, Maas-Fjetterstrom focused on creating rugs that communicated the intimacy of the natural world through a [[modernist]] approach to lines and geometric figures. With pieces in some of the most exclusive art museums in the world and an outsized reputation in the design world more than 70 years after her death, Maas-Fjetterstrom’s accomplishments illustrate the importance of Scandinavian rugs.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

== Modern design trends ==


Due largely in part to the influence of Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom, Scandinavian rugs have remained hugely popular over the past 70 years. Indeed, since her death in 1941, the demand for rugs made after her distinctive style has risen meteorically.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt; Maas-Fjetterstrom, upon her death, left to posterity more than 700 designs for rugs, along with meticulously detailed instructions for how to make them, including the different techniques that should be utilized in their manufacture. In addition to an enormous body of her own original work, Maas-Fjetterstrom also inspired a great many artists whose rugs are hugely desirable all over the world.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Rug designed by artists such as Ann-Mari Forsberg, Barvro Nilsson, Marianne Richter, and others are available, and are hand-made in Maas-Fjetterstrom’s original studio in [[Bastad]], where rugs have been hand-made since 1919.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt; It is difficult to overstate the influence that these designers and their works have had on the world of interior design. Even as tastes have changed since the 1920s and 1930s when Maas-Fjetterstrom herself was designing rugs, there is a quality to Scandinavian rugs that has intrigued leading designers and decorators for decades. If there is any one trend in the world of artisanal rugs, it is the increasing popularity of Scandinavian rugs.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Many mid-twentieth century designers, interior decorators, and modern visionaries have been impressed by the uniquely sparse and geometric composition of traditional Scandinavian rugs, and most especially by those designed by Maas-Fjetterstrom and her peers. The attention to detail and treatment of color in Maas-Fjetterstrom rugs—as well as the approach to geometry and line theory in the most well-known pieces—combine to create just the sort of piece that perfectly complements the design aesthetic of individuals such as [[Ray Eames]], [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. A large reason behind the tremendous popularity enjoyed by mid-century Scandinavian rugs is the heavy incorporation of such pieces into these individuals' own design work.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Galleries and design studios throughout the world have recently begun to invest heavily in those Scandinavian rugs that are considered to be the best and the most representative of the aesthetic values of the famous mid-century modern Scandinavian rug-makers and designers. Galleries that specialize in antique rugs, such as the [[Nazmiyal collection]] in [[New York City]], buy and sell a tremendous amount of Scandinavian rugs, underscoring the growing popularity of such pieces and the increased public demand for Scandinavian rugs. The increased demand for such rugs by galleries and studios is tied to a very real increased demand from decorators, collectors, and consumers.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The growing influence of Scandinavian rug-makers is an affirmation of the importance of the craft to the Swedish people. While not an artistic tradition of Scandinavian origin, rug-making has become a very important avenue of artistic expression in Scandinavia. As the taste for Scandinavian carpets and rugs continues to grow throughout the world, Scandinavian rug-makers will continue to produce unique and enduring works that represent those design elements and aesthetic ideals most important to the culture of the region.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

'''Sea Odyssey: Giant Spectacular''' was a three-day outdoor [[performance art]] event featuring giant [[marionette]]s, that took place in [[Liverpool]], England, from 20 to 22 April  2012.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17777090 |title=Giant puppets in Liverpool for Sea Odyssey Titanic event |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed and operated by French street theatre company [[Royal de Luxe]], and featured three giants, the 9-metre (30-foot) tall Little Giant Girl, the 15-metre (50-foot) tall Giant Uncle, and the girl's dog, Xolo.&lt;ref name=Wake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/04/20/sea-odyssey-little-giant-girl-wakes-up-to-start-three-day-liverpool-spectacular-100252-30801720 |title=Sea Odyssey: Little Giant Girl wakes up to start three-day Liverpool spectacular|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that, over the course of the three days, 600,000 people watched the event&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17798401 |title=Liverpool giants: Sea Odyssey Titanic event ends |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Liverpool City Council recorded a footfall in the main shopping district of 900,000.&lt;ref name=councilstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917|title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent report into the impact of Sea Odyssey concluded it was the most successful event in Liverpool’s history. The report showed that 800,000 people took part in the event, which resulted in an economic impact of £32 million.&lt;ref name=councilstat2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=215928|title=Sea Odyssey success|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

The event, staged to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], was inspired by a letter written by a 10-year-old girl, May McMurray, in 1912 to her father William, a bedroom steward on the Titanic who did not survive the sinking. The letter did not arrive until after the Titanic sailed, and was returned to the sender and is now on display at Liverpool's Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=Inspired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17729987 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey event inspired by Titanic letter |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/2012/04/19/sea-odyssey-the-story-of-the-little-girl-who-inspired-liverpool-s-biggest-ever-street-theatre-event-99623-30779993/ |title=SEA ODYSSEY: The story of the little girl who inspired Liverpool’s biggest ever street theatre event |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RDL_News&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-de-luxe.com/en/news/ |title=Liverpool, "L’Odyssée de la mer" (in French)|publisher=Royal de Luxe, Nantes| date= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the event, estimated at £1.5m, was partly met by European legacy funding from Liverpool's 2008 Capital of Culture year. Early forecasts suggested it resulted in a £12&amp;nbsp;million boost to the city's economy.&lt;ref name=Heart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17812818 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey giant event's £12m economy boost |publisher=BBC |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917 |title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey |publisher=Liverpool City Council |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With initial expectations of around 250,000 people attending,&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17762154 |title=Bringing Liverpool's Sea Odyssey giants to life |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after the event it was estimated that 600,000 people watched the event over the three days.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;

The show was led by Royal de Luxe's artistic director, Jean-Luc Courcoult, who celebrated its conclusion by jumping into the [[River Mersey]].&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Courcoult&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-de-luxe.com/en/jean-luc-courcoult/ |title=Le metteur en scène, Jean-Luc Courcoult |publisher=Royal de Luxe, Nantes| date= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

The story, written by Jean-Luc Courcoult, envisages the girl's uncle, a diver, searching the wreck of the Titanic, and having found his brother's letter, coming ashore to bring it and the news of the ship's fate to his niece.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |title=Liverpool Story |publisher=giantspectacular.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512125448/http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |archivedate=12 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising from the water at Liverpool's [[Salthouse Dock]], the giant uncle wanders around the city in search of the girl, who simultaneously awakes in the city's [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]] and, accompanied by her dog Xolo, sets out to look for her uncle.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt;

The two miss each other several times, finally meeting up at the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] at the end of the second day of the event. The following day, the pair set out together for a final walk around the city centre, and then board a boat at [[Canning Dock]] and leave Liverpool via the River Mersey.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heart&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17806029 |title=Sea Odyssey giants capture Liverpool's heart |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between them, by the end of the three days, the giants covered a distance of 23 miles (37&amp;nbsp;km), taking in the areas around the football grounds of [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Everton F.C.]], the city centre, [[Pier Head]], [[Chinatown, Liverpool|Chinatown]], and the [[Albert Dock]] and King's Dock complexes.&lt;ref name=Inspired/&gt;

==Giants==

The giants taking part in the event comprised the Little Giant Girl, measuring 9 metres (30 feet), the Giant Uncle, measuring 15 metres (50 feet), and the girl's dog, Xolo. The girl and the uncle are constructed from [[Populus|poplar]] wood, [[Tilia|lime]] wood and steel, and have eyes made from street lights and hair made from horse hair. The dog, Xolo, is made from [[papier-mâché]] and steel. All three are controlled using ropes, pulleys and motors.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the three days, the puppets, cranes, and other equipment required a team of 110 operators, who call themselves ''[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]]'' after the characters from the 1726 [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. A total of 20 cranes were required to move them around the city.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt; The uncle requires 31 people to control, with the girl operated by a team of 24 puppeteers, and the dog a team of 21.&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the tour the giants were accompanied by a group of live musicians, and used a number of props, including the girl's boat, on which she sailed for part of her journey, her scooter, deck chair, bed, and radio.&lt;ref name=Story/&gt;

'''''Selected Essays, 1917-1932''''' is a collection of [[prose]] and [[literary criticism]] by [[T. S. Eliot]]. Eliot's work fundamentally changed literary thinking and ''Selected Essays'' provides both an overview and an in-depth examination of his theory.&lt;ref name=BRags&gt;[[BookRags]]: ''Selected Essays of T. S. Eliot, 1917-1932 Study Guide&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1932 by his employers, [[Faber &amp; Faber]], costing 12/6 (''2009: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.625|1932|2009|r=-0}}}}'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 16 September 1932; ''Some New Books''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his poetry, by 1932, Eliot was already accepted as one of English Literature's most important critics. In this position he was instrumental in the reviving interest in the long‐neglected Jacobean playwrights.&lt;ref name=OCAT&gt;Eliot, T[homas] S[tearns]"  The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, 3rd edn., Gerald Bordman and Thomas S. Hischak, eds., Oxford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry'' was originally an addendum to Eliot's preface to Dryden's ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1928 reprint).&lt;ref name=Baden&gt;Richard Badenhausen ''T.S. Eliot and the art of collaboration'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-84123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further essays include ''The Metaphysical Poets (1921)'' in which Eliot argued that a "[[dissociation of sensibility]]" set in...  due to the influence of ... [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Dryden]].&lt;ref Name=ODQ&gt;"T. S. Eliot"  Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. by Elizabeth Knowles. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the modern poet ‘must be difficult’... ‘to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning’.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliot, T. S."  The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philip Massinger (1920)'' contains his [[aphorism]] "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal".&lt;ref Name=ODQ/&gt;

Eliot converted to the [[Church of England]] and some of the essays expressed the form and discipline he felt necessary for fulfillment in his own life.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T[homas] S[tearns]"  The Oxford Companion to American Literature. James D. Hart, ed., rev. Phillip W. Leininger. Oxford University Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''For Lancelot Andrewes (1926)'', examines  [[Lancelot Andrewes|Andrewes]], a 17th-century Anglican bishop whose Eliot considers an important figure in history of the church, distinguished for the quality of his thoughts and prose.&lt;ref name=Lance&gt;"For Lancelot Andrewes"  The Oxford Companion to American Literature. James D. Hart, ed., rev. Phillip W. Leininger. Oxford University Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Humanism of Irving Babbitt (1927)'', Eliot posits that [[Irving Babbitt|Babbitt]]'s faith in civilization must have a discipline derived from dogmatic religious authority.&lt;ref name=Lance/&gt;

==Reception==
''Selected Essays'' was placed fourth in the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]'s [[Fifty Best Books of the Century]] and sixth in [[Modern Library]]'s Best 20th-Century Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ 100 Best Nonfiction] &amp;mdash;Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Illustrators of Los Angeles''' (SILA) was founded in 1953 by a group of [[Southern California]] artists and designers "...to promote the professional status of illustration art as well as foster both philanthropic and educational goals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si-la.org Society of Illustrators of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt;

A scholarship program is provided, and annual awards are presented to illustrators for their works.  The top annual award, named after the first president of SILA, is the "'''[[Joseph Morgan Henninger]] Award'''".

The Society maintains an association with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) whereby members may contribute appropriate art to the USAF Art Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afapo.hq.af.mil/Presentation/main/Index.cfm United States Air Force Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing artists are flown at government expense to a show of their works and receive awards for their contributions.  The artists retain copyright to their works.

The Society supports an active blog to keep members informed and conducts classes and workshops at Pop Secret Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometown-pasadena.com/events/pop-comedy/131118 "POP! Comedy"] ''Hometown Pasadena''. Retrieved 6 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">The '''Symphony No. 3''' is a composition for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Ned Rorem]].  The work was first performed by the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the direction of [[Leonard Bernstein]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 16, 1959.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rorem |first=Ned |authorlink=Ned Rorem |date=1958 |title=Symphony No. 3 |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Ned-Rorem-Symphony-No-3/5107 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Structure===
The Symphony No. 3 has a duration of roughly 24 minutes and is cast in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Passacaglia
#Allegro molto vivace
#Largo
#Andante
#Allegro molto

The movements were not composed in chronological order; Rorem wrote the "Allegro molto vivace" first, the "Pasacaglia" second, the "Andante" third, the "Largo" fourth, and the "Allegro molto" last.  Rorem called the first movement "a slow overture in the grand style."  The second movement, which the composer described as "a brisk and jazzy dance," had originally been composed as a piece for two pianos eight years prior.  Rorem described the third movements as "a short, passionate page about somnambulism, full of dynamic contrast, and coming from afar."  He called the fourth movement "a farewell to France" and described the fifth and final movement as a miniature [[Concerto for Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=ROREM, N.: Symphonies Nos. 1-3 (Bournemouth Symphony, Serebrier) |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559149&amp;catNum=559149&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English# |access-date=November 3, 2016 |first=José |last=Serebrier |authorlink=José Serebrier |type=CD liner |publisher=[[Naxos Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[piccolo]], two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]], [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[celesta]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Though rarely performed, the symphony has received praise from music critics.  Andrew Farach-Colton of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' praised the symphony, writing, "The first movement passacaglia is simply gorgeous – listen beginning at 3'15" to hear how much Rorem gleaned from [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] – and the two adjacent slow movements are also exquisitely coloured. I find the manic, [[Leonard Bernstein|Bernstein]]-esque scherzo uncharacteristically coarse, though the finale more than makes up for it, providing exhilaration and plenty of orchestral razzle-dazzle without a trace of raucousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Farach-Colton |first=Andrew |title=Rorem Three Symphonies |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/rorem-three-symphonies |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing a 2000 performance at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]], [[Allan Kozinn]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' similarly observed, "It is in some ways very much of its time, in that it embodies an updated form of [[Impressionism in music|Impressionism]], filtered through an American urbanity, as well as stretches of jazzy theatricality in the style of Bernstein (who conducted this work's premiere) and even a trace of [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s faux-Western accent."  He added, "It may also have been a manifesto of sorts, an assertive declaration that tonality and conventional structures still had something to say at a time when [[Serialism]] was ascendant. The work has not been heard very frequently, but today its tonal, eclectic personality is current again: tonality is now acceptable everywhere, and composers 40 years younger than Mr. Rorem (who is a young-looking 76) write music that makes similar allusions."  Kozinn also called it "a demanding work" and wrote, "Its dense, outgoing sections require power and assurance, and its more graceful slow movements require delicacy and a fine balance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kozinn |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |title=MUSIC REVIEW; When Tonality Refused to Stay Quiet |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/06/arts/music-review-when-tonality-refused-to-stay-quiet.html |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Basket of Apples''''' is a [[still life]] oil painting by French artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It belongs to the [[Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection]] of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

The piece is often noted for its disjointed [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].  It has been described as a balanced composition due to its unbalanced parts;&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;Schapiro, Meyer (1988). ''Cézanne'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc, p.96. {{ISBN|0-8109-1043-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the tilted bottle, the incline of the basket, and the foreshortened lines of the cookies mesh with the lines of the tablecloth.&lt;ref name=Schapiro/&gt; Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints.&lt;ref name=AIC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_10.shtml |title=Paul Cézanne: The Basket of Apples |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago: Art Access |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paintings such as this helped form a bridge between [[Impressionism]] and [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name=AIC/&gt;

'''''The Dancing Couple''''' is a 1663 oil painting by [[Jan Steen]]. It depicts a boisterous party with a dancing couple in the center. The work is currently in the Widener Collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1220.html The Dancing Couple], [[National Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved on 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting Jan Steen creates a very festive environment.

'''The New York Intellectuals''' were a group of American writers and literary critics based in [[New York City]] in the mid-20th century. Mostly Jewish, they advocated [[left-wing politics]] but were also firmly [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]]. The group is known for having sought to integrate [[literary theory]] with [[Marxism]] and [[Socialism]] while rejecting Soviet [[Communism]] as a workable or acceptable political model.

[[Trotskyism]] emerged as the most chosen standpoint among these anti-Stalinist Marxists. [[Irving Howe]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Leslie Fiedler]] and [[Nathan Glazer]] were members of the Trotskyist [[Young People's Socialist League]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bloom: Prodigal Sons. The New York Intellectuals and Their World, Oxford University Press: NY / Oxford 1986, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Writers often identified as members of this group include [[Hannah Arendt]], [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]], [[Daniel Bell]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Elliot E. Cohen|Elliot Cohen]], [[Midge Decter]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], [[Nathan Glazer]], [[Clement Greenberg]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Richard Hofstadter]], [[Sidney Hook]], [[Irving Howe]], [[Alfred Kazin]], [[Irving Kristol]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[William Phillips (editor)|William Phillips]], [[Norman Podhoretz]], [[Philip Rahv]], [[Harold Rosenberg]], [[Isaac Rosenfeld]], [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[Susan Sontag]], [[Harvey Swados]], [[Diana Trilling]], [[Lionel Trilling]], and [[Robert Warshow]].

Many of these intellectuals were educated at [[City College of New York]] ("Harvard of the Proletariat"), [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]] in the 1930s, and associated in the next two decades with the left-wing political journals ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'', as well as the then-left-wing but later neoconservative-leaning journal ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''. Writer [[Nicholas Lemann]] has described these intellectuals as "the American [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]]".

Some, including Kristol, Hook, and Podhoretz, later became key figures in the development of [[Neoconservatism]].

==Development==
Galbraith regards the book as being needed due to media coverage of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] informing people about Japanese fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/29803-geek-speak-japanese-style--e2-80-98the-otaku-encyclopedia-e2-80-99-.html |title=Geek-Speak Japanese Style: ‘The Otaku Encyclopedia’|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Scott Green regards ''The Otaku Encyclopedia'' as not being "disposable criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/42408 |title=AICN Anime - Gantz, Otaku Encyclopedia, New Imagi Astro Boy Footage, New Priest Casting, Battle Angel Sighting? Macross and More|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Schilling, writing for ''[[The Japan Times]],'' regards the encyclopedia's goal as being to "supply facts about the objects of obsession, while opening windows into the mysterious culture that produced them.", saying that the book does not have enough "critical distance or analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fb20090726a1.html |title=The quirky terrain of an otaku mind |publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Ruh feels that although the book tries to be broad in its scope, it is written from a fan perspective and shows that Galbraith is primarily a "moe otaku".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruh |first=Brian |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/brain-diving/otaku-where-art-thou/2010-12-14 |title=Otaku, Where Art Thou? - Brain Driving |work=Anime News Network |date=2010-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Teapot'''" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Theepotten'') is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a teapot and her adventures. The tale was first published 1863 and demonstrates the Andersen's talent for investing ordinary household objects with life, character, and personality.

== Plot summary ==
A porcelain teapot rules the tea table. She is very proud of her handle and spout, but not quite so proud of her lid (which is cracked). She is very proud of holding the tea leaves and of being the one to pour forth her contents for thirsty humankind. One day, the teapot is dropped and the handle and spout are broken. She is given to a beggar woman who fills her with soil and plants a flowering bulb within her. The teapot then feels a happiness she has never known. At the last, the teapot is broken in two, the bulb removed to a bigger pot, and the teapot thrown away. She cherishes her memories.

== Publication history==
[[Image:teapot Pedersen 01.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], an early illustrator of Andersen's works]]
The tale was first published December 1863 in ''Folkekalender for Danmark''. The work was republished 12 December 1871 in the fourth volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. 1871.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=160 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Teapot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13624">{{Intellectual property}}
'''Trade dress''' is a legal [[term of art]] that generally refers to characteristics of the visual appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |authorlink3=Mark A. Lemley |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade dress is a form of [[intellectual property]].

== India ==
The new ''Trade Marks Act'', 1997, which came into force in September 2003 introduced a  new legal definition of a trade mark, which, in part, encompasses almost all the elements of trade dress as defined by the US law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indialawjournal.com/volume1/issue_4/article_by_purnime.html "Trade dress protection for 'look and feel' of the Website"] ''India Law Journal'' (retrieved October 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Passing off}}
Trade dress can be protected as getup under the law of [[passing off]] in the UK. Passing off is a common law remedy for protecting an unregistered [[trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Birgit|last2=Hitchens|first2=Ben|title=United Kingdom: The perils and powers of passing off|url=http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/Magazine/Issue/54/Country-correspondents/The-perils-and-powers-of-passing-off|website=World Trademark Review|publisher=Globe Business Media Group|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Getup, packaging, business strategy, marketing techniques, advertisement themes etc. can also be protected under passing off.

==United States==
Trade dress protection is intended to protect consumers from packaging or appearance of products that are designed to imitate other products; to prevent a consumer from buying one product under the belief that it is another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Trademark Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/intellectual_property/trademark_law.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 29&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the shape, color, and arrangement of the materials of a children's line of clothing can be protectable trade dress (though, the design of the garments themselves is not protected),&lt;ref&gt;''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc.'', 529 U.S. 205 (2000), https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-150.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; as can the design of a magazine cover,&lt;ref&gt;''Reader’s Digest Ass’n v. Conservative Digest'', 821 F.2d 800 (D.C. Cir. 1987), http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/821/821.F2d.800.86-7004.86-5495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the appearance and décor of a chain of Mexican-style restaurants,&lt;ref name="twopesos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 US 763, 112 S. Ct. 2753, 120 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1992)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12034599115584297601|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a method of displaying wine bottles in a wine shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Cellars Inc. v. Grape Finds at Dupont, Inc.'', 90 F. Supp. 2d 431 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11114552205999238299|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory source===
In the U.S., like [[trademark]]s, a product’s trade dress is legally protected by the [[Lanham Act]], the federal statute which regulates trademarks and trade dress.&lt;ref&gt;The Lanham Act, http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch22.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's trade dress can be protected without formal registration with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO).&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 650, Lanham Act 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)&lt;/ref&gt; In relevant part, section 43(a) states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which
:(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive [...] as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of  his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or
:(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statute allows the owner of a particular trade dress ("container for goods") to sue an infringer (a person or entity who illegally copies that trade dress) for violating section 43(a) without registering that trade dress with any formal agency or system (unlike the registration and application requirements for enforcing other forms of intellectual property, such as patents).  It is commonly seen as providing “federal common law” protection for trade dress (and trademarks).&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 650&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal registration===

Trade dress may be registered with the PTO in either the [[Principal Register]] or the [[Supplemental Register]].&lt;ref&gt;PTO website, http://www.uspto.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Although registration is not required for legal protection, registration offers several advantages.  In the Principal Register, a registrant gains nationwide [[constructive use]] and [[constructive notice]], which prevent others from using or registering that registrant’s trade dress (without contesting the registration).&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act § 7(c), 15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a registrant in the Principal Register gains [[incontestable status]] after five years, which eliminates many of the ways for another party to challenge the registration.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act § 15, 15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Registration under the Supplemental Register allows the registrant to protect its trade dress in foreign countries, although the protections are much more limited than protections under the Principal Register in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Menell at 696&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===

It can be difficult to obtain protection for trade dress, as applicants must prove that the design has secondary meaning to consumers and is then further limited by the functionality doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michael Best &amp; Friedrich, LLP|title=Entrepreneur’s Guide to Intellectual Property – Blog Series: Protecting Your Products and Packaging with Trade Dress|journal=The National Law Review|date=10 June 2012|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/entrepreneur-s-guide-to-intellectual-property-blog-series-protecting-your-products-a|accessdate=17 November 2014|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Functionality====

To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must not be “functional.”  That is, the configuration of shapes, designs, colors, or materials that make up the trade dress in question must not serve a utility or function outside of creating recognition in the consumer’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 US 159, 115 S. Ct. 1300, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17905304466595211702|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, even though consumers associated a distinct spring design for wind resistant road signs with a particular company, the spring design was not protectable for trade dress purposes because the springs served the function of withstanding heavy wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 US 23, 121 S. Ct. 1255, 149 L. Ed. 2d 164 (2001)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12704680276957369308|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered “functional” depends upon the specific product or thing sought to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feisthamel|first1=Karen|last2=Kelly|first2=Amy|last3=Sistek|first3=Johanna|title=Trade Dress: Best Practices for the Registration of Product Configuration Trade Dress with the USPTO|journal=The Trademark Reporter|date=November 2005|volume=95|issue=9|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/thetmr95&amp;div=121|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the color red in a line of clothing may not be functional (and thus part of protectable trade dress) whereas the same color on a stop sign would be functional because the color red serves the function of putting drivers on alert (and thus would not be part of a protectable trade dress).

====Distinctiveness====
To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must be “distinctive.”  This means that consumers perceive a particular trade dress as identifying a source of a product.&lt;ref name="twopesos"/&gt;

Claimed trade dress in the product design—as opposed to product packaging—context can no longer be "inherently distinctive"; it must acquire distinctiveness through "secondary meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc.'', 529 U.S. 205, 120 S. Ct. 1339, 146 L. Ed. 182, 54 USPQ2d 1065 (2000)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11551321958641509496|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctiveness through secondary meaning means that although a trade dress is not distinctive on its face, the use of the trade dress in the market (the “[[Goodwill (accounting)|good will]]” of the trade dress) has created an association between that trade dress and a source in the mind of the consumer.

Although the law is evolving, as it stands now, product packaging (including packaging in very general terms, such as a building’s décor) may be inherently distinctive.&lt;ref name="twopesos"/&gt; However, product design, that is the design or shape of the product itself, may not be inherently distinctive, and must acquire secondary meaning.

===Protection for electronic interfaces and websites===
Although the exact boundaries of protection are still uncertain, courts are beginning to allow trade dress protection for the overall “[[look and feel]]” of a website.  In ''Blue Nile, Inc. v. Ice.com, Inc.'', the plaintiff sued the defendant for copying the overall “look and feel” of plaintiff’s retail jewelry websites, including the design of plaintiff’s search pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Blue Nile, Inc. v. Ice.com, Inc.'', 478 F. Supp. 2d 1240 (W.D. Wash., 2007)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16544665442853652360|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the court ordered more factual development before it could rule definitively on the issue, the court did hold that it was possible for the look and feel of the websites to have trade dress protection if the plaintiff’s copyright claims did not already cover those parts.  In ''[[SuicideGirls|SG Services]], Inc. v. [[GodsGirls|God’s Girls]], Inc.'', the court denied trade dress protection for the plaintiff’s website because the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the website was non-functional or distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SG Serv., Inc. v. God’s Girls, Inc.'', non-reported case, 2007 WL 2315437 (C.D. Cal. 2007)|url=http://www.websupp.org/data/DOR/3:05-cv-01526-28-DOR.pdf|website=WebsUpp|accessdate=12 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705111818/http://www.websupp.org/data/DOR/3:05-cv-01526-28-DOR.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case shows the court’s willingness to consider trade dress protection for a website, even though the court did not find protection in this case.  It is notable, however, that the ''SG Services'' court did not look at the overall “look and feel” of the website, but rather, at specific characteristics (such as color) of the website that the plaintiff claimed were infringed.

Although the future of trade dress protection for websites is still very unclear, much thought has been given to this area and it will likely continue to be actively developing area for courts and litigants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Xuan-Thao N. |last=Nguyen |title=Should it be a Free for All?
