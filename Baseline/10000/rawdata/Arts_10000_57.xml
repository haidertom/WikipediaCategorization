      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Allosemitism''' is a neologism used to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as [[Other (philosophy)|other]].

==Origin of term==

The term was coined by Polish [[literary critic]] [[Artur Sandauer]] and popularized by Polish sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Sandauer used the term "allosemitism" in his essay ''On Situation of Polish Writer of Jewish Descent In the 20th Century'' published as a book in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Sandauer, O sytuacji pisarza polskiego pochodzenia żydowskiego w XX wieku (Rzecz, którą nie ja powinienem był napisać...) (Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1982, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] proposed the term in his 1997 essay "Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern",” in which he argued  that "allosemitism" should be used in place of "[[anti-semitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, “Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern,” in Modernity, Culture, and “the Jew,” ed. Bryan Cheyette and Laura Marcus (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman's argument is that allosemitism can represent a “radically ambivalent attitude,” that encompassing both [[Philo-Semitism]] and anti-Semitism;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)." The German Quarterly 78.4 (2005): 496-516.&lt;/ref&gt; allosemitism is a form of [[proteophobia]], fear and horror of things that defy clean-cut categories, not, like antisemitism, of a simple fear of the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" ([[heterophobia]]); and that Judeophobia is diverse, and, therefore, not adequately encompassed by the term antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Frojmovic. Review of Kessler, Herbert L.; Nirenberg, David, eds., Judaism and Christian Art: Aesthetic Anxieties from the Catacombs to Colonialism, 
H-Judaic, H-Net Reviews. March, 2013. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32937]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Gruber]] describes the neologism as a response to "the idea that, good or bad, Jews are different from the non-Jewish mainstream and thus unable to be dealt with in the same way or measured by the same yardstick."&lt;ref name=GruberOther&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ruth|title=Allosemitism (noun)—Jews as the perpetual ‘other’|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/allosemitism_noun_jews_as_the_perpetual_other_20080807|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gruber, the term was coined by Polish-Jewish literary critic [[Artur Sandauer]].&lt;ref name=GruberOther/&gt;

In her 2010 book ''Modernism, Feminism, and Jewishness'', literary scholar Maren Tova Linnett describes the term as originated by both Sandauer and Bauman.&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use== 

Linnett uses the term "to describe the multiple modes of difference that these women authors ascribed to the Jew in order to complicate what she views as the overly simplistic polarities of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]] employs the concept in his 2014 book ''Confronting Allosemitism in Europe: The Case of Belgian Jews.''

'''Anders Petters stuga''' or '''Anders Petters stuga står i ljusan låga''' is an old [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Christmas music|Christmas song]] of unknown origin. It is often sung when dancing around the [[Christmas tree]]. Alternate lyrics are '''Anders Perssons stuga'''. Lyrical, the song deals with a fire in "Anders Petters'" [[cottage]]. While the lyrics don't mention [[Christmas]], the words "ljusen" are here strongly associated with the [[candle]]s lit at Christmastime.

The '''''Annunziata Polyptych''''' is a  painting cycle started by [[Filippino Lippi]] and finished by [[Pietro Perugino]], whose central panel is now divided between the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Galleria dell'Accademia]] (''Deposition from the Cross'') and the [[Basilica dell'Annunziata, Florence|Basilica dell'Annunziata]], both in [[Florence]], Italy. The polyptych had other six panels, which are housed in the [[Lindenau-Museum]] of [[Altenburg]], the [[Metropolitan Museum]] of  [[New York City]], the  [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]] in Rome and in a private collection in South Africa.
[[File:Pietro Perugino cat74f.jpg|left|120px|thumb|''Saint Lucy'' from the side panels of the polyptych [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/saint_john_the_baptist_saint_lucy_perugino_pietro_di_cristoforo_vannucci/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110001721].]]

==History==
The work was originally commissioned to Filippino Lippi for the high altar of the Annunziata Basilica in Florence. Lippi had already ceded the same commission to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who had executed a cartoon with ''St. Anne, the Virgin and the Child'', before abandoning the work when he followed [[Cesare Borgia]] (1502). The work was thus reassigned to Lippi, who changed completely the theme. At his death in 1504 the painting, already completed in the central part, was assigned to [[Pietro Perugino]], who completed it, including the secondary panels, in 1507.

Once finished, the painting was sharply criticized by the Florentines, due to the alleged lack of originality of the composition. At the time, Perugino was often re-using the same cartoons, due to big number of commissions. The ''Annunciation'' [[altarpiece]] was thus Perugino's last work in Florence.

==Description==
The work was originally painted on two sides: the ''Annunciation'' facing  the faithful, and the ''Deposition from the Cross'' facing the choir. After the panel was split in two, the latter was moved in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Duke]]'s collections, and then to the Gallerie dell'Accademia; the ''Annunciation'' remained in the church, and was later moved to the Rabatta Chapel. The polyptych had a frame designed by [[Baccio d'Agnolo]].

The ''Deposition'' shows the moment in which Jesus Christ is taken down from the cross after his death. Four men are carrying out the task by using ladders. On the ground, at the left, is the Virgin, fainting in the [[Swoon of the Virgin]], and supported by the other Pious Women. The person praying at the foot of the cross is [[Mary Magdalene]], regarding reverently the feet that she had so recently washed and anointed.  On the right, caught in a surprised posture, is St. John the Apostle; in front of him, on the ground, are the nails of the crucifixion. It could also be that he is advising the men to be careful with their task, to handle the body of the Lord with ultimate care.

According to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Lippi executed the upper part of the painting. Jesus, left unfinished, was completed by Perugino concerning the face. The latter also painted the lower part of the work, characterized by his typical serene faces and the distant landscape. Perugino's assistants painted a great number of details, especially in the side panels.

The polyptych was completed by a predella, now divided between several American museums. It included:

The '''Boston Symphony Orchestra''' ('''BSO''') is an American [[orchestra]] based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  It is one of the five major American symphony orchestras commonly referred to as the "[[Big Five (orchestras)|Big Five]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923579,00.html | title=Which U.S. Orchestras are Best? | author=Michael Walsh | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1983-04-25 | accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1881, the BSO plays most of its concerts at Boston's [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] and in the summer performs at [[Tanglewood]].

[[Andris Nelsons]] is the current music director of the BSO.  [[Bernard Haitink]] currently holds the title of conductor emeritus of the BSO, and [[Seiji Ozawa]] has the title of BSO music director laureate.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Henry Lee Higginson by John Singer Sargent 1903.jpeg|thumb|Henry Lee Higginson, founding father of the BSO.]]
The BSO was founded in 1881 by [[Henry Lee Higginson]]. Its first conductor was [[George Henschel]], who was a noted baritone as well as conductor, and a close friend of [[Johannes Brahms]]. For the orchestra, Henschel devised innovative orchestral seating charts and sent them to Brahms, who replied approvingly and commented on the issues raised by horn and viola sections in a letter of mid-November 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avins|first=Styra|title=Johannes Brahms: Life and Letters |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-816234-0 |pages=587–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nathaniel Livermore Stebbins Boston Symphony Orchestra 1891.jpg|thumb|left|The BSO at [[Boston Music Hall]] in 1891.]]
The orchestra's four subsequent music directors were all trained in Austria, including the seminal and highly influential Hungarian-born conductor [[Arthur Nikisch]], in accordance with the tastes of Higginson. [[Wilhelm Gericke]] served twice, from 1884 to 1889 and again from 1898 to 1906. According to Joseph Horowitz's review of correspondence, Higginson considered 25 candidates to replace Gericke after receiving notice in 1905. He decided not to offer the position to [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Fritz Steinbach]], and [[Willem Mengelberg]] but did not rule out the young [[Bruno Walter]] if nobody more senior were to accept. He offered the position to [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] in February 1905, who declined, to [[Felix Mottl]] in November, who was previously engaged, and then to previous director Nikisch, who declined; the post was finally offered to [[Karl Muck]], who accepted and began his duties in October 1906. He was conductor until 1908 and again from 1912 to 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Joseph|title=Classical Music in America: A history of its rise and fall |publisher=[[W.W. Norton and Company]] |year=2005|isbn=0-393-05717-8 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music director 1908–12 was [[Max Fiedler]]. He conducted the premiere of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]'s [[Symphony in B minor (Paderewski)|Symphony in B minor "Polonia"]] in 1909.

During World War I, Muck (born in Germany but a Swiss citizen since childhood), was arrested, shortly before a performance of the [[St. Matthew Passion]] in 1918, and interned in a prison camp without trial or charge until the end of the war, when he was deported. He vowed never to return, and conducted thereafter only in Europe. The BSO's next two titled conductors were French: [[Henri Rabaud]], who took over from Muck for a season, and then [[Pierre Monteux]] from 1919 to 1924. Monteux, because of a musician's strike, was able to replace 30 players, thus changing the orchestra's sound; the orchestra developed a reputation for a "French" sound which persists to some degree to this day.&lt;ref name="monteux-french"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n29DHVKhZggC&amp;pg=PA866 |title=Pierre Monteux |encyclopedia=All Music Guide to Classical Music |page=866 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koussevitzky and Munch===
[[File:Boston Symphony Hall from the south.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Symphony Hall, Boston]], the main base of the orchestra since 1900]]
The orchestra's reputation increased during the music directorship of [[Serge Koussevitzky]]. One million radio listeners tuned in when Koussevitzky and the orchestra were the first to perform a live concert for radio broadcast, which they did on NBC in 1926.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffeoiFFET3kC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=%22the+firestone+hour%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V7eJkYpK3d&amp;sig=XUg3Ry-AMypT90WlO2Y2MxmvKNo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mHsHTd29N4O78gaNq7iWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=13&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20firestone%20hour%22&amp;f=false| last=Young| first=William H. and Nancy K.| title=Music of the Great Depression| publisher=Greenwood Press| location=Westport, CT| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Koussevitzky, the orchestra gave regular radio broadcasts and established its summer home at [[Tanglewood]], where Koussevitzky founded the [[Berkshire Music Center]], which is now the [[Tanglewood Music Center]]. Those [[radio network|network]] radio broadcasts ran from 1926 through 1951, and again from 1954 through 1956. The orchestra continues to make regular live radio broadcasts to the present day. The Boston Symphony has been closely involved with Boston's [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] Radio as an outlet for its concerts.

Koussevitzky also commissioned many new pieces from prominent [[composer]]s, including the [[Symphony No. 4 (Prokofiev)|Symphony No. 4]] of [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Second Rhapsody]]'' and the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]]. They also gave the premiere of [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]], which had been commissioned by the Koussevitzky Music Foundation at the instigation of [[Fritz Reiner]] and [[Joseph Szigeti]].

Koussevitzky started a tradition of commissions that the orchestra continued, including new works by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] ([[Symphony No. 11 (Villa-Lobos)|Symphony No. 11]]) and [[Henri Dutilleux]] for its 75th anniversary, [[Roger Sessions]], and [[Andrzej Panufnik]], for the 100th, and lately for the 125th works by [[Leon Kirchner]], [[Elliott Carter]], and [[Peter Lieberson]]. Other BSO commissions have included [[John Corigliano]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Corigliano)|Symphony No. 2]] for the 100th anniversary of Symphony Hall. [[Hans Werner Henze]] dedicated his [[Symphony No. 8 (Henze)|Eighth Symphony]] to the orchestra.

Although Koussevitsky recommended his protégé [[Leonard Bernstein]] to be his successor after he retired in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alex |last=Ross |title=Fresh Breezes: An impressive début and new works at Tanglewood |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 27, 2012 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2012/08/27/120827crmu_music_ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BSO awarded the position to the Alsatian maestro [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]]. Munch had made his Boston conducting debut in 1946.  He led orchestra on its first overseas tour, and also produced their first stereo recording in February 1954 for [[RCA Red Seal Records|RCA Victor]].  In 1952, Munch appointed the first woman to hold a principal chair in a major U.S. orchestra, flutist [[Doriot Anthony Dwyer]], who remained as BSO principal for 38 years.&lt;ref name="Kean"&gt;{{Cite thesis|degree=D.Mus.A.|title=First Flute: The Pioneering Career of Doriot Anthony Dwyer|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11132007-163128/unrestricted/Kean_dis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720005545/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11132007-163128/unrestricted/Kean_dis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-20|location=Baton Rouge, La.|last=Kean|first=Kristen Elizabeth|year=2007|publisher=Louisiana State University|accessdate=2010-05-31|docket=|oclc=209994674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leinsdorf, Steinberg, and Ozawa===
[[Erich Leinsdorf]] became music director in 1962 and held the post until 1969. [[William Steinberg]] was then music director from 1969 to 1972. Steinberg was "ill and ailing" according to composer/author [[Jan Swafford]], and "for four years he was indisposed much of the time."&lt;ref name="Swafford"&gt;{{cite web| first=Jan| last=Swafford| title=The Elusive Maestro: Why the process of finding a new conductor makes music lovers weep| publisher=Slate.com| date=April 12, 2011|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2011/04/the_elusive_maestro.single.html| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Steinberg's retirement, according to BSO trustee John Thorndike (who was on the search committee) the symphony's board spoke to [[Colin Davis]] and "investigated very thoroughly" his appointment, but Davis's commitments to his young family did not allow his moving to Boston from England;&lt;ref name="eichler-sep-2011"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Eichler |title=Who will pick up the baton?

As the search continued, [[Leonard Bernstein]] met with four board members and recommended [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], who had been Assistant Conductor and Associate Conductor under Steinberg, for the directorship, but the young conductor "did not have sufficient support among the BSO players," according to journalist Jeremy Eichler.&lt;ref name="eichler-sep-2011" /&gt; The committee eventually chose [[Seiji Ozawa]], who became Music Director in 1973 and held the post until 2002, the longest tenure of any Boston Symphony conductor. ([[Bernard Haitink]] served as principal guest conductor from 1995 to 2004, and was named conductor emeritus in 2004.)

Ozawa's tenure involved significant dissension and controversy. One concern was his handling of the [[Tanglewood Music Center]]. [[Greg Sandow]] wrote in the [[Wall Street Journal]] in December, 1998 that Ozawa "had taken control of the school with what many people thought was surprising and abrupt brutality. Members of the faculty, themselves world-famous, had angrily resigned."&lt;ref name="Sandow"&gt;{{cite news| first=Greg| last=Sandow| title=Conduct(or) Unbecoming the Boston Symphony| work=[[Wall Street Journal]]| date=December 15, 1998| url=http://www.gregsandow.com/old/ozawa.htm| publisher=gregsandow.com| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first departure was in the fall of 1996, when Ozawa fired Richard Ortner, the Festival's administrator.&lt;ref name="Fleisher-Midgette"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Leon| last1=Fleisher| first2=Anne|last2=Midgette| title=My Nine Lives: A Memoir of Many Careers in Music| publisher=Doubleday| date=November 30, 2010| page=288| isbn=978-0-385-52918-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a tumultuous season, at the end of summer 1997, pianist [[Gilbert Kalish]] resigned from the faculty by sending Ozawa what the pianist/conductor [[Leon Fleisher]] later described as "a blistering letter of resignation, and he made it public"; Fleisher, who was also a long-term member of the Tanglewood faculty, wrote, "Most of the faculty felt he was speaking for them."&lt;ref name="Fleisher-Midgette" /&gt; Ozawa reduced Fleisher's role at the Center, offering him instead a "ceremonial puppet role," and Fleisher resigned, writing to Ozawa that the proposed role was "somewhat akin to having my legs chopped off at the knees, you then gently taking me by the arm and inviting me for a stroll. I must decline the invitation."&lt;ref name="Fleisher-Midgette" /&gt; (On the other hand, music critic Richard Dyer wrote that "...not every change was for the better...But there can be no question that Tanglewood is a busier, more adventurous, and more exciting place than it was before Ozawa became music director."&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite news| first=Tim| last=Page| title=Keeping Time at Tanglewood| work=[[Opera News]]| url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/issue/article.aspx?id=417&amp;issueID=14&amp;archive=true| date=June 2004| volume=68 No.4| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; )

A more basic concern involved perceived shortcomings in Ozawa's musical leadership; as Sandow wrote in the 1998 article, "what mattered far more was how badly the BSO plays."&lt;ref name="Sandow" /&gt;  He noted that a group of Boston Symphony musicians had privately published a newsletter, ''Counterpoint'', expressing their concerns; in the summer of 1995&lt;ref name="Dezell"&gt;{{cite news| first=Maureen| last=Dezell| title=Ozawa's supporters rebut Journal attack| work=[[Boston Globe]]| date=December 16, 1998| url=http://www.gregsandow.com/old/globe.htm| publisher=gregsandow.com| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; concertmaster Malcolm Lowe and principal cellist [[Jules Eskin]] wrote that in rehearsal Ozawa gave no "specific leadership in matters of tempo and rhythm," no "expression of care about sound quality," and no "distinctly-conveyed conception of the character of each piece the BSO plays."&lt;ref name="Sandow" /&gt;

The BSO's managing director, Mark Volpe, responded that some board members considered Sandow's article a "hatchet job," and some unnamed BSO "observers" were said in the [[Boston Globe]] to believe that Sandow "might be sharpening blades for BSO members with axes to grind".&lt;ref name="Dezell" /&gt; Sandow called the suggestion "nonsense," saying, "I found them [players criticizing Ozawa in his article], they didn't find me".&lt;ref name="Dezell" /&gt; [[André Previn]] wrote to the ''Wall Street Journal'' defending Ozawa,&lt;ref name="Dezell2"&gt;{{cite news| first=Maureen| last=Dezell| title=Beleaguered BSO Answers Wall Street Journal Attack| work=Boston Globe| date=December 25, 1998| url=http://www.gregsandow.com/old/globe2.htm| publisher=gregsandow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lowe wrote to the Journal that he was "frustrated and upset to see my name attached to the article since your reporter did not contact me and chose to quote a letter published nearly four years ago in an internal orchestra publication."&lt;ref name="Dezell2" /&gt; Boston Symphony Board of Trustees president Nicholas T. Zervas described Sandow as expressing an "`insulting, reductive, and racist view of [Ozawa] as a [[samurai]] kept in place in order to raise Japanese money"&lt;ref name="Dezell2" /&gt;  - a point Sandow rebutted in a letter to the Journal, saying "These are things I didn’t say. I’d heard the charge about Japanese money while I was writing my piece, so I asked Mark Volpe, the BSO’s General Manager, what he thought of it. Mark refuted it, and I quoted him approvingly."&lt;ref name="Dezell2" /&gt; Critic Lloyd Schwarz defended Sandow in the Boston alternative paper, ''The Boston Phoenix''&lt;ref name="sandow blog"&gt;{{cite web| first=Greg| last=Sandow| title=Weighing in on My Side| url=http://www.gregsandow.com/old/myside.htm| date=January 1999| accessdate=2013-07-18| publisher=gregsandow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various current music critics describe a decline in the orchestra's playing during Ozawa's tenure. [[Jan Swafford]] writes, "Now and then he gave a standout performance, usually in the full-throated late-Romantic and 20th-century literature, but most of the time what came out was glittering surfaces with nothing substantial beneath: no discernable concept, no vision."&lt;ref name="Swafford" /&gt; In a 2013 survey of recordings of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]], a [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] music critic, the composer Russell Platt, writes of "Seiji Ozawa’s downright depressing account, recorded in 1979: the Boston Symphony Orchestra's sonic shine, developed by Ozawa's predecessors Monteux and Charles Munch, is audibly dripping away, its dispirited musicians losing their sense of individual responsibility to the score. It is a record of a professional relationship that went on far too long."&lt;ref name="platt"&gt;{{cite news| first=Russell| last=Platt| title=The Rite Stuff| work=The New Yorker| date=June 17, 2013| url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/06/deccas-rite-of-spring-boxed-set.html| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 1999, the symphony announced Ozawa's departure as music director, as of 2002, following the sudden announcement of Ozawa's appointment as music director of the [[Vienna State Opera]] - a decision the board had heard about only a day earlier, where Volpe said he was "a little surprised at the timing".&lt;ref name="metcalf"&gt;{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Metcalf| title=Ozawa's Decision To Leave Boston Symphony A Surprise| work=[[Hartford Courant]]| date=June 24, 1999| url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-06-24/news/9906240188_1_bso-management-senior-bso-boston-symphony-orchestra| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his last concert with the orchestra in July 2002.&lt;ref name="Page" /&gt;

===Levine and Nelsons===
In 2004, [[James Levine]] became the first American-born music director of the BSO.  Levine received critical praise for revitalizing the quality and repertoire since the beginning of his tenure, including championing contemporary composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/other_stories/multi_1/documents/04551268.asp | title=Stretching exercises: The BSO challenges the audience and itself | work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]] | first=Lloyd | last=Schwartz | date=March 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181511/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/other_stories/multi_1/documents/04551268.asp | archive-date=2007-09-30 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Levine's tenure, by February 2009 the BSO had performed 18 world premieres, 12 of them conducted by Levine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7aced680-f792-11dd-81f7-000077b07658.html?ftcamp=rss |last=Loomis |first=George |title=Boston Symphony Orchestra/Levine, Symphony Hall, Boston |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fund the more challenging and expensive of Levine's musical projects with the orchestra, the orchestra established an "Artistic Initiative Fund" of about $40 million.

In the wake of Levine's resignation, [[Andris Nelsons]] made his first guest-conducting appearance with the BSO in March 2011, as an emergency substitute for Levine at Carnegie Hall in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]].&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;{{cite news| last=Oestreich |first=James R. | title=A Fresh Face Confronts a Seasoned Mahler| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/arts/music/boston-symphony-orchestra-at-carnegie-hall-review.html| work=The New York Times| date=2011-03-19 | accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently guest-conducted the BSO at Tanglewood in July 2012,&lt;ref name="oestreich"&gt;{{cite news| last=Oestreich |first=James R. | title=Tanglewood Tries Out a New Face: Andris Nelsons Conducts Boston Symphony at Tanglewood| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/arts/music/andris-nelsons-conducts-boston-symphony-at-tanglewood.html?_r=0| work=New York Times| date=July 16, 2012| accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his first appearance with the BSO at Symphony Hall in January 2013.  In May 2013, the BSO named Nelsons as its 15th music director, effective with the 2014-2015 season.  His initial contract is for 5 years, with 8–10 weeks of scheduled appearances in the first year of the contract, and 12 weeks in subsequent years.

====Unequal-pay lawsuit====
On July 2, 2018, the principal [[flautist]] of the BSO filed a lawsuit in [[Suffolk County Superior Court]] claiming pay discrimination on the basis of gender. Elizabeth Rowe claims she is paid much less than the principal [[oboist]], who is male, since 2004 and is seeking more than $200,000 in unpaid compensation from the orchestra. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eichler |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2018/07/05/bso-principal-flutist-sues-for-equal-pay/Mx9KncUJ0P2wXqOUaTJUlJ/story.html |title=The BSO’s principal flutist says she is paid far less than the man who is the principal oboist |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2018-07-06 |accessdate=2018-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSO is trying to discredit the principal flautist's claim that she is being discriminated against because of the unequal pay compared to the BSO's male oboe lead by saying in a court filing that the two [[Woodwind instrument|wind instruments]] are not comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Greg.

==Related ensembles==
The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], the Boston Symphony Orchestra minus its principal players, was founded in 1885, and plays lighter, more popular classics, and [[Musical theatre|show tunes]]. [[Arthur Fiedler]] was the conductor who did the most to increase the fame of the Boston Pops over his tenure from 1930 to 1979.  Film composer [[John Williams]] succeeded Fiedler as the conductor of the Pops from 1980 to 1993.  Since 1995, the conductor of the Boston Pops has been [[Keith Lockhart]].

The Boston Symphony Chamber Players were launched in 1964. Today they are the only chamber ensemble composed of principal players from an American symphony orchestra. In addition to regular performances in Boston and Tanglewood, they have performed throughout the United States and Europe.  They have also recorded for RCA Victor, DG, Philips, and Nonesuch.

Performing with the BSO and Boston Pops for major choral works is the [[Tanglewood Festival Chorus]]. Organized in 1970 by its founding director, [[John Oliver (conductor)|John Oliver]], the Chorus comprises over 300 volunteer singers.  Before the creation of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and for some time after, the BSO frequently employed the New England Conservatory Chorus conducted by Lorna Cooke DeVaron, Chorus Pro Musica, [[Harvard Glee Club]] and [[Radcliffe Choral Society]].  In February 2017, the BSO announced the appointment of James Burton as the new conductor of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and as the newly created BSO Choral Director, both with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.bso.org/brands/bso/press/press-releases/archived-press-releases/122716/february-2-2017-james-burton.aspx | title=Boston Symphony and Andris Nelsons Announce Major Appointment in Music Leadership: James Burton is Appointed Conductor of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and Also Takes on Newly Established Role of BSO Choral Director | date=2 February 2017 | accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
The Boston Symphony made its first acoustical recordings in 1917 in [[Camden, New Jersey]] for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] conducted by [[Karl Muck]].  Among the first discs recorded was the finale to [[Tchaikovsky]]'s fourth symphony.  
Under Serge Koussevitzky, the orchestra made its first electrical recordings, also for Victor, in the late 1920s. These electrical recordings included [[Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]''.  Recording sessions took place in Symphony Hall.  Koussevitszy's final recording with the Boston Symphony was a high fidelity version of [[Sibelius]]' Symphony No. 2, recorded in 1950 and released on LP.

In February 1954, RCA Victor began recording the orchestra in stereo, under the direction of Charles Munch. RCA Victor continued to record Munch and the orchestra through 1962, his final year as music director in Boston (see the [[Charles Munch discography]] for a complete list of commercial recordings with the BSO under Charles Munch). During Munch's tenure, Pierre Monteux made a series or records with the BSO for RCA Victor (see [[Pierre Monteux]] for a complete list of commercial recordings with the BSO).

Erich Leinsdorf, who had already made numerous recordings for RCA Victor, continued his association with the company during his seven years in Boston.  These included a critically acclaimed performance of Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''German Requiem'']] (see [[Erich Leinsdorf]] for a complete list).

Then, the orchestra switched to [[Deutsche Grammophon]] (DG) under William Steinberg.  RCA Victor recorded several LPs with Steinberg and [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'' with [[Georges Prêtre]] during the transition to DG (see [[William Steinberg]] for a complete list of commercial recordings). [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], who was assistant conductor and associate conductor under Steinberg, also made several recordings for DG; some of these have been reissued on CD.

Due to Steinberg's illness, DG recorded the BSO with [[Rafael Kubelík]] in Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 (part of his cycle of Beethoven symphonies with nine different orchestras), ''[[Ma Vlast]]'' by [[Bedřich Smetana]] and in [[Béla Bartók]]'s Concerto for Orchestra as well as with [[Eugen Jochum]] conducting Symphony No. 41 by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Franz Schubert]]'s Symphony No. 8.

As a guest conductor in the 1960s, Ozawa made several recordings with the BSO for RCA Victor.  He continued the BSO relationship with DG while making several other releases for [http://www.newworldrecords.org/%20New%20World%20Records New World Records]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Over the course of Ozawa's tenure, the BSO diversified its relationships, making recordings under Ozawa with CBS, EMI, [[Philips Records]], RCA, and [[TELARC]].

The BSO also recorded for Philips under Colin Davis.  [[Leonard Bernstein]] made records for both Columbia and DG with the BSO, including selections from his last concert ever as a conductor on 19 August 1990 at Tanglewood.  The BSO has also appeared on Decca with [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], with [[Charles Dutoit]] and [[André Previn]] for DG, and on Phillips and Sony Classical with Bernard Haitink.

The BSO has also done recording for film scores on occasion. Films such as ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (both composed and conducted by [[John Williams]]) were recorded by the orchestra at Symphony Hall.

In the James Levine era, the BSO had no standing recording contract with a major label;&lt;ref name="npr-recording"&gt;{{cite web |work= [[Weekend Edition]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4634528 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |title=Philly Orchestra Composes Innovative Contract |date=2005-05-07 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |format=audio}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grammy Award-winning recording of Levine conducting the BSO with [[Lorraine Hunt Lieberson]] in [[Peter Lieberson]]'s ''Neruda Songs'', released on [[Nonesuch Records]], was the only major label recording during Levine's tenure. On February 19, 2009, the BSO announced the launch of a new series of recordings on their own label, BSO Classics. Some of the recordings are available only as digital downloads. The initial recordings included live concert performances of [[William Bolcom]]'s 8th Symphony and ''Lyric Concerto,'' the latter with flutist James Galway, [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|Sixth Symphony]], the Brahms ''Ein deutsches Requiem'', and [[Ravel]]'s complete ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'',&lt;ref name="bostonglobe-bsoclassics"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/02/20/listening_to_levine_two_cds_a_season_of_firsts/ |last=Eichler |first=Jeremy |title=Listening to Levine: two CDs, a season of firsts |work=The Boston Globe|date=February 20, 2009| accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[Grammy Awards of 2010|2010]] [[Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance]].&lt;ref name="nyt-grammy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/arts/music/01grammylist.html?sq=grammy%20awards&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Grammy Awards: List of Winners |work=The New York Times |date=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the BSO announced a new recording partnership with [[Deutsche Grammophon]] that focuses on the music of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], with Nelsons as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/04/03/nelsons-bso-embark-shostakovich-cycle/HSNmCHqkPuP9L7aUVPkUYN/story.html | title=Nelsons, BSO embark on Shostakovich cycle | work=Boston Globe | author=Jeremy Eichler | date=2015-04-04 | accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recording in the series, of the [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth Symphony]] recorded in concert in April 2015, was released on CD in August 2015, and subsequently won the year's Grammy award for Best Orchestral Performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14340">The '''British Construction Industry Awards''' ('''BCI Awards''' or '''BCIA''') were launched by the [[New Civil Engineer]] magazine and Thomas Telford Ltd - both owned by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] - in 1998.

The awards seek to recognise outstanding achievement in the construction of buildings, taking account of a wide range of factors including architectural and engineering design, but also consideration of the construction process, delivery to time and budget, and client satisfaction.

In 2012, [[Network Rail]] chief executive [[David Higgins (businessman)|Sir David Higgins]] was the chair of the 2012 British Construction Industry Awards judging panel which celebrated its 25th anniversary of rewarding excellence in UK construction delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.nce.co.uk/news/business/sir-david-higgins-to-chair-british-construction-industry-awards-2012-judges/8624531.article |title =Sir David Higgins to chair British Construction Industry Awards 2012 judges |website =www.nce.co.uk |publisher=[[New Civil Engineer]]|date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coexist image''' (often styled as "CoeXisT" or "COEXIST") is an image created by Polish, [[Warsaw]]-based graphic designer {{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}} in 2000 as an entry in an international art competition sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam for Dialogue, Understanding and Coexistence]].  The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in [[Jerusalem]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

Variations of this artwork have been used as [[bumper stickers]] and elements in [[rock concert]]s.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TDB /&gt;

==Creation – ''COEXISTENCE'' art exhibition==

{{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}}, a Polish graphic designer based in [[Warsaw]], had his original work chosen by a [[Juried (competition)|jury]] to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} x {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam]] in Jerusalem.  The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;

His original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized [[Crescent#Pre-Islamic and Islamic uses|Muslim Crescent]], the X replaced by an oversized [[Star of David]], and the T replaced by an oversized [[Latin Cross]].&lt;ref name=Atu2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/cant-we-all-just-coexist.html

==U2 Vertigo Tour==
[[File:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|thumb|U2 in Mexico City on the ''Vertigo'' tour – photo taken during the playing of [[Sunday Bloody Sunday]] ]]
During the international 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour]] of the Irish rock band [[U2]], the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", the group would play politically-themed songs.  During the opening portion of "[[Love and Peace or Else]]", [[Bono]] wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonobaltimore/18007038/|others=Kurman, Mike|accessdate=2015-10-20|title=Bono, 5\28\05, Boston, MA, TD Banknorth Garden

==Bumper sticker==
The image and variations of it are used as automobile [[bumper sticker]]s.&lt;ref name=TDB&gt;{{cite web|work=The Daily Beast|date=2014-12-21|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|title=COEXIST's Bonehead Bumper-Sticker Politics: America's simplistic adoption of the COEXIST bumper sticker signals a dangerous inability to understand the roots of religious conflict.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224214154/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|archivedate=2014-12-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] which began after the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.&lt;ref name = "Wrasman" /&gt;

One common version of the bumper sticker spells "COEXIST" using an Islamic crescent moon for the "C", a [[peace sign]] for the "O", a combination of the [[male symbol]] and [[female symbol]] for the "E", a [[Star of David]] for the "X", a [[pentagram]] for the dot of the "I", a [[yin-yang symbol]] for the "S", and a Christian cross for the "T".&lt;ref name = "Wrasman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrasman|first=Andy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Contradict|year=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|pages=2–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043909/https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBGoVChMIk5L4mL7MyAIVQvI-Ch2mqQEN#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781490819297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Lance|editor-last=Gharavi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0wjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Religion, Theatre, and Performance: Acts of Faith|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136483400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the [[Bay Area]] region centered on [[San Francisco]]. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion.&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;{{cite book|last=Fish|first=M.

==Legal disputes==
In 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other.  They were also unaware that a company in [[Indiana]] already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003.  At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own.  The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image.  Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

[[File:Louis-Nicolas Clerambault.jpg|thumb|French composer [[Louis-Nicolas Clérambault]] composing at the keyboard]]
A '''composer''' ([[Latin]] [[wikt:compono|''compōnō'']]; literally "one who puts together") is a [[musician]] who is an [[author]] of [[music]] in any form, including [[vocal music]] (for a [[Singing|singer]] or [[choir]]), [[instrumental music]], [[electronic music]], and music which combines multiple forms. A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].

Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.

==Composers and performers==
Since [[musical notation]] only incompletely expresses a piece of music, there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert. Even in a classical piece of instrumental music in which all of the melodies, chords, and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a good degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work by varying her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.

A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]].

Music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom diminished in later eras, reflected in the increased use by composers of detailed notation, including marks of expression telling the performer more precisely how the work should be executed. A culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.

The [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a "cover" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness highly valued (with the possible exception of "note-for-note" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).

In Classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

==History==
The level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.

[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]
The term "composer" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].

===Ancient Greece===
Music was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written around 200 BC to around AD 100 {{sfn|Landels|1999|loc=252}} is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Aydın]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].

During the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.&lt;!--?--&gt; The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''Allegory of Music'', by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
During the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

===Baroque===

During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (1600 to 1750), composers expanded the range and complexity of the music they were writing. The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D.|publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[François Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].

Composers of music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical Period]] (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.

Composers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

|}
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 "Incidental music"], Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.

===20th- and 21st-century music===
[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]
In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.

==Role of women==
{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
In 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993" /&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=; 11:04 AM &amp;bull; by Abbey Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt;

Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|title=WQXR – New York's Classical Music Radio Station|website=WQXR|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clustering==
Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history. Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' and using [[word count]] measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris has been the main hub for classical music in all periods. It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Training==
Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.

===Undergraduate===
Bachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.

===Masters===
Master of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.

===Doctoral===
To become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.

Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.

===Other routes===
Some classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.

==Employment==
During the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.

[[File:Dead man's hand.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The card hand purportedly held by [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at the time of his death: black aces and eights]]
The '''dead man's hand''' is a nickname for a particular [[poker]] hand, popularly a [[two-pair]] of black aces and black eights, although definitions of the hand have varied through the years. 

Such a hand is said to have been held by [[Old West]] [[folk hero]], lawman, and [[gunfighter]] [[Wild Bill Hickok]] when he was murdered. No contemporaneous source records this hand's exact cards, but [[Frank Wilstach]]'s 1926 book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers'' led to the popular modern conception of the "dead man's hand" as containing pairs of black aces and black eights. In Hickok's case these would have been combined with an unknown [[kicker (poker)|hole]] card.

==Earliest details==
The expression "dead man's hand" appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/275/was-wild-bill-hickok-holding-the-dead-mans-hand-when-he-was-slain "Was Wild Bill Hickok Holding the Dead Mans Hand When He Was Slain'']; [[The Straight Dope]] article; retrieved March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest detailed reference to it was 1886, where it was described as a "[[full house (poker)|full house]] consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0607E&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R910&amp;I=-3  ''Discussion'']; July 3, 1886, article in the ''[[Grand Forks Daily Herald]]''; at [[Linguist List]] online; retrieved February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks and sevens are called the dead man's hand in the 1903 ''Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Linn Morrison Daniels, et al; editor; ''Volume 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmond Hoyle]] refers to it as Jacks and eights in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond Hoyle]]; ''Hoyle's Games''; 1907; p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hickok's hand==
What is considered the dead man's hand card combination of today gets its notoriety from a legend that it was the [[five-card stud]] hand held by James Butler Hickok (better known as "Wild Bill" Hickok) when he was shot in the back of the head by [[Jack McCall]] on August 2, 1876, in [[Nuttal &amp; Mann's Saloon]] at [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]]. Reportedly, Hickok's final hand included the aces and eights of both black [[suit (cards)|suits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''; Frank J. Wilstach; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book by Western historian [[Carl W. Breihan]], the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand. "Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy's son: the ace of diamonds with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickok's blood on it."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Women of the West''; Signet; 1982; p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: "The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker'."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: Gunfighter''; Joseph G. Rosa; p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rosa said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Man and his Myth''; Joseph Rosa; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The solidification in [[card game|gamer]]s' parlance of the dead man's hand as two pairs, aces and eights, did not come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''—50 years after Hickok's death.&lt;ref name="Dope"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="707">The '''eavesdrop''' or '''eavesdrip''' is the width of ground around a house or building which receives the [[rain]] water dropping from the [[eaves]]. By an ancient [[Anglo-Saxon law]], a landowner was forbidden to erect any building at less than two feet from the boundary of his land, and was thus prevented from injuring his neighbour's house or property by the dripping of water from his eaves. The law of Eavesdrip had its equivalent in the Roman [[stillicidium]], which prohibited building up to the very edge of an estate.

'''Edith Halpert''' or '''Edith Gregor Halpert''' (née Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch) (1900–1970) was a pioneering [[New York City]] [[Art dealer|dealer]] of [[American modernism|American modern art]] and [[American Folk Art|American folk art]]. She brought recognition and market success to many [[avant-garde]] American artists. Her establishment, the Downtown Gallery, was the first commercial art space in [[Greenwich Village]]. When it was founded in 1926, it was the only New York gallery dedicated exclusively to contemporary American art by living artists. Over her forty-year career, Halpert showcased such modern art luminaries as [[Elie Nadelman]], [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Jack Levine]], [[William Steig]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], Walter Meigs, [[Arthur Dove]], [[John Marin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others. Halpert later expanded her business to include American folk art, and certain nineteenth-century American painters, including [[Raphaelle Peale]], [[William Harnett|William Michael Harnett]], and [[John F. Peto|John Frederick Peto]], whom she considered to be precursors to American modernism.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;Pollock, Lindsay, ''The Girl With the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert And the Making of the Modern Art Market'', PublicAffairs, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she arrived in the U.S. as a Russian Jewish immigrant of modest means, Halpert transformed the landscape of American art, and died a multimillionaire at the age of 70. [[Sotheby's]] credits her with putting American modern art auctions on the map with the posthumous sale of her personal collection for $3.6 million in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, p. 383, 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Malcolm, ''Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States'', Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513673-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Halpert was born Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch to Gregor and Frances Lucom Fivoosiovitch in [[Odessa]] (then [[Russia]], now [[Ukraine]]) on April 25, 1900. She had a sister, Sonia, five years older. Shortly after the deadly [[Odessa pogroms#1905 Pogrom|pogroms of October 1905]], Edith emigrated to New York City in 1906 with her mother and sister (her father died in 1904 of [[tuberculosis]]).&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70668720|title=The girl with the gallery : Edith Gregor Halpert and the making of the modern art market|last=Lindsay.|first=Pollock,|date=2006|publisher=Public Affairs|isbn=9781586483029|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=70668720}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the family name changed to Fivisovitch.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; They initially settled on the west side of [[Harlem]], then a predominantly Jewish immigrant neighborhood, and Edith attended the progressive [[Wadleigh High School for Girls]].&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"/&gt; At 14, she further Americanized her name to Edith Georgina Fein and began to pursue a career as an artist. She studied drawing under [[Leon Kroll]] and [[Ivan Olinsky]] at the [[National Academy of Design]] and life drawing with [[George Bridgman|George Bridgeman]] at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]].&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; She was also a member of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art#History|Whitney Studio Club]] and [[John Weischel]]'s [[People's Art Guild]], a radical artists' cooperative for which she served as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archino|first=Sarah|date=2013-09-01|title=The People’s Art Guild and the Forward Exhibition of 1917|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/674925|journal=American Art|volume=27|issue=3|pages=14–19|doi=10.1086/674925|issn=1073-9300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, she met the American painter [[Samuel Halpert]] through the People's Art Guild, and they married the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Samuel Halpert: Art and Life 1884-1930|last=Tepfer|first=Diane|publisher=Millenium Partners|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; The couple remained in New York City, where Samuel continued to paint while Edith worked to support them. In 1925, they lived at the Maison Watteau in Montparnasse, then Paris's liveliest artist community. The following summer the Halperts stayed at the artist colony founded by [[Hamilton Easter Field]] in [[Ogunquit]], [[Maine]]. They rented a cottage from [[Robert Laurent]], and mingled with other American artists who were residing there that summer: [[Stefan Hirsch]], [[Bernard Karfiol]], [[Walt Kuhn]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Katherine Schmidt]], [[Niles Spencer]], and [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], all of whom would later join her gallery.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; Many of the artists in Ogunquit were interested in folk art and used it to decorate their homes and as inspiration in their work.

Samuel and Edith Halpert divorced in 1930, just before his untimely death caused by streptococci [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

== Business career ==
In order to support herself and her mother (and later, her husband), Halpert took a number of jobs in rapid succession and became a highly successful businesswoman. At 16 she worked at [[Bloomingdale's]] department store, first as a [[comptometer]] operator and then as an illustrator in the advertising department. She then worked in the foreign office of [[Macy's]] before becoming an advertising manager at [[Stern Brothers]]. She then switched careers, working as an efficiency expert for the garment manufacturers Cohen-Goldman and Fishman &amp; Co. Between 1920 and 1925, Halpert served in a number of capacities with S.W. Straus &amp; Company, the bank investment firm that originated real-estate mortgage bonds. By the age of 25, she was earning a substantial salary and had been appointed to the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34642572|title=Money of the mind : borrowing and lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken|last=James.|first=Grant,|date=1994|publisher=Noonday Press|isbn=9780374524012|edition= 1st Noonday Press|location=New York|oclc=34642572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; Despite her high status as one of the few leading female executives of her day, she quit her association with Straus at her husband's urging in 1925.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; This left her with more time to devote to her marriage and gave her an opportunity to refocus her ambitions on the business of art.

==Opening The Downtown Gallery==
After a successful rise in the business world, Halpert used money from bonuses to open Our Gallery at 113 West 13th Street with her friend Berthe Kroll Goldsmith in November 1926. The gallery featured contemporary American art, often by friends of Halpert and her husband, artist [[Samuel Halpert]]. The following year, the name of the gallery changed to the '''Downtown Gallery''' (a suggestion of [[William Zorach]])&lt;ref name="AAAFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/files/resources/finding-aids/pdf/downgall.pdf|title=A Finding Aid to the Downtown Gallery Records,1824-1974, bulk 1926-1969, in the Archives of American Art|last=Stover Gaines|first=Catherine|date=|website=|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early brochures, Halpert and Goldsmith described their mission thus: "The Downtown Gallery has no prejudice for any one school. Its selection is driven by quality--by what is enduring--not by what is in vogue."&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==The Downtown Gallery, American Folk Art Gallery, and The Daylight Gallery==
The [[American Folk Art Gallery]], founded by [[Holger Cahill]] in partnership with Halpert and Goldsmith, opened in 1929 as the first folk art gallery, moving in upstairs from the Downtown Gallery. The affinity between Halpert's artists and folk art was strong and sales of folk art sustained the Downtown Gallery through the Depression. ([[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] was a consistent buyer.) A third space opened in 1930, the Daylight Gallery, was run behind the main gallery and emphasized art and sculpture displayed in diffuse natural light.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Fortifying The Downtown Gallery==
Halpert's business skills helped her manage prices to encourage buying by collectors of modest means. She also used marketing and advertising and worked to get her artists included in museums and public collections to increase their exposure. In an attempt to fortify the gallery, after buying out Goldsmith in 1935, Halpert winnowed her artist roster down to twelve and focused her efforts on profitability. In 1940, the gallery relocated to 43 East 51st Street and again to 32 East 51st Street in 1945.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

As an advisor for the [[WPA Federal Art Project]], Halpert had access to many non-New York based artists, who she brought to her gallery. She also worked to attract artists formerly represented by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] who died in 1946. Additionally, she took on artist estates such as [[Arthur Dove]] (a former Stieglitz artist). All of these artists added after 1936 were eventually transferred, without the artists' consent, to the Alan Gallery, led by Halpert's assistant director Charles Alan. The Downtown Gallery relocated one last time to the Ritz Tower Concourse at 465 Park Avenue in 1965.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Contributions to the art world==
Halpert served as organizer and director of the [[First Municipal Exhibition of American Art]], Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1929. Her work with the [[WPA Federal Art Project]] took her to Washington D.C. in the summer of 1936 to develop the Exhibition and Allocation Program, which facilitated nationwide circulation for works from regional art centers. In 1937, she formed the Bureau for Architectural Sculpture and Murals, a central clearing-house from which architects could review and select work by artists and sculptors experienced in working in architectural settings (similar in mission to her Daylight Gallery). Halpert served as curator of the art section of the American National Exhibition, sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency]] and the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]; she traveled to the Soviet Union with the exhibition, installed the show, and gave daily gallery talks in Russian.

In 1952, to promote art history, Halpert established the Edith Gregor Halpert Foundation. Its activities included assisting universities to fund scholarships for the study of contemporary American art and championing the rights of artists to control the sale and reproduction of their work. In recognition of her dedication to the arts, Halpert received the Art in America Award in 1959, a [[USIA]] Citation for Distinguished Service in 1960, and the First Annual International Silver Prize from the [[University of Connecticut]] for "distinguished contribution to the arts" in 1968.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

Halpert was an avid collector. Exhibitions drawn from her collection include: ''American Modernism: The First Wave, Painting from 1903-1933'', presented at [[Brandeis University]] Museum of Art, 1963; ''Six Decades of American Art'', shown at [[Leicester Galleries]], London, 1965; ''Image to Abstraction'', held at [[Amon Carter Museum]], 1967; and ''Edith Halpert and the Downtown Gallery'', exhibited at the [[University of Connecticut]], 1968. The Edith Gregor Halpert Collection was eventually sold at auction by Sotheby Parke-Bernet, 1973.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
{{see also|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}

In May 1996, several commercial expeditions at base camp of [[Mount Everest]] prepare for a climb to the summit. [[Rob Hall]], who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads [[Adventure Consultants]]; [[Scott Fischer]] is chief guide for Rob's rival, [[Mountain Madness]]. Rob's clients include [[Beck Weathers]], an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran [[Yasuko Namba]], who hopes to complete her final [[Seven Summits]] ascent; and [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine journalist [[Jon Krakauer]]. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp.

A month earlier in [[New Zealand]], Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.

Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2:00 P.M., the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about overexertion.

Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the [[Hillary Step]] and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he won't get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit, Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from altitude sickness. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]].

As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.

Scott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.

Guide Andy 'Harold' Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.

Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, witnesses Yasuko's corpse, and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten, and in desperate need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli, finds his body, and moves it off the trail.

Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he lost both hands and nose to severe frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest.

Totino said, "It was very challenging because we had to re-create the sun, which at Everest is so incredibly sharp and crisp." The team used SoftSun lights for creating sun on the summit, Hillary Step and icefall. "They were 9 feet long and 3 ½ feet in diameter and 100,000 watts. They had to be moved around on cranes because they are very heavy," Totino said.&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; To photograph one scene during which expedition guide Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is stuck on the mountain in the storm, Totino recalled: "We tented off a portion of the set with some very heavy plastic and brought in these giant refrigerating units, half the size of a semi truck, and we cooled that part of the stage down to about 26 to 28 degrees Fahrenheit [around -3°C] and brought in real snow. Baltasar really wanted the actor to feel like he was frozen. You really see and feel that."&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; The film was shot with [[Arri Alexa XT]] cameras, using the Arriraw format.&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/everest-cinematographer-recalls-very-difficult-818689|title='Everest' Cinematographer Recalls "Very Difficult Shoot"|first=Carolyn | last=Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song plays in the bus when it passes through a busy Nepali bazaar. Another song in the film is "[[All I Wanna Do (Sheryl Crow song)|All I Wanna Do]]", performed by [[Sheryl Crow]], which is accurate to the timing of the film's events, in 1996.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 73%, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Everest'' boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get out a movie about mountain climbers, even if it's content to tread less challenging narrative terrain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everest_2015/ |title=Everest |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/everest |title=Everest |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Krakauer]], author of ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', denounced the movie, stating some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director [[Baltasar Kormákur]] responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film and alleging that Krakauer's version conflicted with actual events.&lt;ref name=krakauerNotFan&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGovern|first1=Joe|title=Into Thin Air author Jon Krakauer is not a fan of Everest|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/thin-air-author-jon-krakauer-not-fan-everest|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Into Thin Air"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krakauer |first1=Jon |title=Into Thin Air |date=1997 |publisher=Villard Books |location=United States |isbn=978-0385494786 |page=300ff |pages=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gt7EQgH8-b4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=into+thin+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGo63LnPXeAhWE61MKHRlOBy4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=into%20thin%20air&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 November 2018 |ref=Into Thin Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freedom™''''', the sequel to '''''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]''''', is the second of a two-part novel, by the author [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]], about a distributed, persistent computer application, known as '''The Daemon''', that begins to change the real world after the original programmer's death.

==Plot==
The sequel picks up shortly after the end of ''Daemon''. Sobol's distributed AI has already infiltrated the computer systems of numerous companies and governments. Many companies have surrendered, either out of fear of annihilation or because they have been converted to the fairer and more efficient system. While the Daemon is a technological creation, much of the work is carried out by human beings, compelled by the Daemon to change the world, according to the vision of Matthew Sobol.

Connected by the "Darknet", the human followers, using Sobol's game engine (for his award-winning game "The Gate") as a base, have created their own ranking system and economy. Online identities mimic an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], with operatives doing tasks to gain levels and gaining access to new technologies and help from the Daemon in an effort to advance their communities. Numerous towns have slowly joined the Daemon's network as a means to improve their own situations and their society as a whole.

The rest of the world believes the Daemon is still a hoax, due to the efforts of the US government (and its allies) to appear to the general public that they are still in charge. In truth, the American political and economic system is collapsing, with the price of fuel and the unemployment rates both skyrocketing.

As with the first book, the interweaving stories follows specific characters:

'''Detective Sebeck''', now acting as an unwilling Daemon operative, has been sent on a "quest" by the avatar of the late Matthew Sobol, one in which will to determine the role of freedom to the human race. Using special glasses to see online Darknet items and threads, Sebeck is joined by a Daemon operative, Laney Price, and he soon learns that his quest is being monitored by the entire Darknet community.

Sebeck begins his quest meeting another operative named Riley, who introduces him to the newly growing Daemon communities, dubbed Holons, which are based on being self-sufficient, using natural energy sources and technologies, and avoiding the military-industrial complex opposed to the type of freedom that the Daemon communities want. Riley teaches Sebeck how to navigate the Darknet and to use it to his advantage. With Laney in tow, Sebeck journeys around the country, always witnessing important events in the history of the Daemon. Sebeck reunites with Jon in a town called Greely, Iowa.

It is one of several Midwestern towns chosen by the elite powers for invasion and destruction. Sebeck's Darknet quest thread returns, and he and Laney follow it through enemy lines, only to discover that it is a trap laid by the Major, who has developed a means of infiltrating the Daemon mainframe and make slight alterations. After being bound and interrogated by the Major, who offers to give him his former life back as a detective, husband, and father in return for his cooperation and information, Sebeck refuses. As he and Laney are taken to be executed via a wood chipper, Loki arrives with a pack of Razorbacks, killing their captors, and Moseley arrives to rescue him and Price. Reuniting with other Darknet faction members, Sebeck participates in the attack on the Sky Ranch that results in the destruction of the corporate monopoly and the Daemon research team.

After the fighting, Sebeck resumes his quest and travels with Laney, Jon Ross, and Natalie Phillips to Morgan's Point Cemetery in Texas. The 3D avatar of Mathew Sobol reveals his intentions and desires for a world in which all are equal. Having seen both sides and the war that followed Sebeck makes the choice that the Daemon is not a threat and allows the world now forming to exist. Then, Sebeck is rewarded with an online message from his son Chris, who forgives him for all that has happened, and Sebeck happily heads home to be reunited with his family.

'''Jon Ross''', fearing both the established authority and the actions of people like Loki, has joined the Daemon community to help shape it into a thing for good. He travels to China to recruit an old friend (and former spy) Shen Liang, but Liang refuses to believe that the Daemon network is real. Using Daemon technology that cloaks his image on CCTV cameras, Ross escapes before he can be taken into custody. Ross attempts to convince Natalie Phillips to join the Daemon community, but she rebuffs him. Ross then heads to Greely, meeting Hank Fossen, awaiting Sebeck's approach. The reunion is short-lived when they learn that Greely is surrounded by private security forces.

Ross joins several other townsfolk to defend Greely, but they are outnumbered and outmatched by the heavy weapons and armored fighting vehicles of the private security forces. They are almost killed, but the virtual Darknet avatar of Roy Merritt, a Level 200 champion, rescues them and defeats the private security forces with airborne laser drones after they refuse to surrender. Worried that Natalie will be in danger from Loki's machines during his impending attack on Sky Ranch, he travels there to give her a Darknet Amulet of Protection. After the battle is won, he and Natalie join Sebeck in the last leg of his quest, preparing for a life together.

At the funeral for Roy Merritt, '''NSA Agent Natalie Philips''' is approached by Loki who informs her that the Daemon operatives attending are there to honor his memory. Merritt has become a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity. Loki tries to show her that she is working for the wrong side, but instead, she attempts to warn the authorities. Loki, in response, attacks a number of funeral attendants but only members of the private military contractor employed by the Major, Korr Security International.

Following the funeral, Phillips is made a scapegoat and relieved of her duties at the NSA. Ross attempts to convince her to join the Daemon community, but she refuses. Phillips has a plan to stop the government from taking control of the Daemon by destroying it. To that effect, Phillips allows herself to be recruited by the Major and a man named General Johnston. Flown to the Sky Ranch, the remaining base of operations for the ani-Daemon forces, Phillips is informed of their plan to seize control of the Daemon in a worldwide operation code, named Exorcist. After reading over a detailed report of Operation Exorcist, Phillips is highly suspicious of the relatively simple exploit in the Daemon's code that is described.

With the defeat of the General's offensive against the Daemon communities, Phillips is reunited with Ross, and together, they realize that Johnston's true plan is to allow most of the world's corporations to be destroyed by the Daemon (while protecting their own assets) and using the inevitable chaos to seize control of key facilities around the globe and declare a new world order with them in control. The General has no real use for Phillips other than to testify to the world the orthodox details of how the Daemon was supposedly defeated from the bogus report that she was given after the operation itself was over. However, they soon learn that Sobol had intentionally left fake errors in the Daemon's code and that the Daemon was many steps ahead of the private corporations, broadcasting their attempt to take over the world to the public and eliminating the personal wealth of everyone in charge. Declaring her love for Ross, together, they head off with Sebeck to witness him finish his quest and prepare for their future together.

'''Brian Gragg''' ("Loki Stormbringer") is the most powerful known human Daemon operative in existence, a Level 56 Sorcerer. Working with only his personal contingent of Razorbacks along with advanced weapons and armor, he scours America looking for the Major. Though he is well known, his rankings is low for his antisocial behavior and his rude, spiteful disposition. Heinrich Boerner, the 3D avatar of the Nazi soldier Gragg defeated to gain the attention of the Daemon in the first place, offers to become his ally because of Loki's extremely high power level, offering to commit any act or execute any order upon the conditions of the said order being met, including taking revenge for Loki if he were to be killed. Loki quickly accepts this offer.

Loki's first attempt to kill the Major fails when the Major escapes across water, where he is safe from Loki's machines, but eventually, Loki gains a lead that allows him to track the Major to a roadside motel. After using his Razorbacks, AutoM8s, and 'Angel Teeth' (guided spikes dropped from above) to kill the private security team guarding the Motel, he enters to find not the Major but an attractive girl, being held hostage. She claims that she is a low-level Daemon operative captured on a mission to deliver a valuable Darknet power ring. When Loki puts the ring on in an attempt to steal it, the ring injects Loki with a paralytic serum; he kills the girl with a blast of lightning before falling to the ground. Before falling unconscious, he sees several more men enter the room and destroy his Razorbacks, which he is unable to control, and he is finally captured by the Major.

Brought to a stable, Loki is stripped nude and tortured by the Major and removed from the Daemon's network. All biometric markers are cut off including his tongue, eyes and finger tips. However, it is later revealed that he was eventually rescued by the avatar of Boerner and implanted with cybernetic eyes, fingers, and a hypersonic speech module. He rescues Sebeck from being killed and then uses his Darknet power to dispatch an enormous army AutoM8's and Razorbacks to level Sky Ranch, hellbent on killing the Major.

After defeating the perimeter guard, his brutal assault on everyone at the Sky Ranch (including civilians) incurs the ire of the entire Daemon community. After being a large amount of negative ratings, the avatar of Roy Merritt arrives and attempts to reason with him to stop the killing, but when he refuses, Merritt uses his power to demote Loki to just level 10. Emotionally ruined and with all of his power taken away, Loki collapses, but his fellow Daemon members reach out to help him.

'''Hank Fossen''' is a third-generation farmer from Greely, who is recruited into the Daemon network by his daughter Jenna. Fighting a nuisance lawsuit against a company Halperin Organix, which has been illegally planting seeds on his property to create patent violations, Hank learns of Jenna's participation with a suspicious group in town. Jenna reveals the concept of the Daemon to Hank and promises that Halperin Organix's lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have gained "level 4 legal protection."

An assault on their farm, by hired mercenaries, is thwarted by Ross and other Daemon operatives, but upon learning about the impending assault on Greely, Hank sends Jenna and his wife to a predetermined shelter and then tries to help make a stand with Ross and the local Sheriff. Hank is shot and killed in the assault, but his sacrifice is not in vain. Using a community-created 3D avatar of Roy Merritt to coordinate a counterattack, the holon of Greely is able to defeat the assault force.

'''The Major''' is now the most wanted man in the Daemon community for his numerous crimes including the murder of Roy Merritt. An old hand at suppressing third worlds, the Major continues to make plans against the Daemon. He ruminates about his past as a heavy for the big corporations, killing people who have threatened their exploitation of foreign countries. He escapes an attempt on his life by Loki, but the experience makes the Major realize that he may not win this war.

In battling the Daemon, the government has been forced into a difficult alliance with private corporations employing the Major, giving rise to private armies who use the cover of night and corporate propaganda to create a state of fear. Intensifying his efforts the Major has dispatched foreign bought mercenaries and uses the corporate media to lie to the general public.

Developing a way to penetrate the Darknet by recruiting homeless teenagers, he eventually ambushes Loki taking him prisoner. He tortures Loki both for revenge and so that the Major can steal his identity within the Darknet. He later heads the Midwestern offensive from the Sky Ranch while simultaneously capturing Sebeck. After a speech in which he notes that the general population needs to be controlled by a ruling class, he orders Sebeck to be killed to keep the cover story of his past "execution".

After his plans collapse, the Major hides in a secret bomb shelter at Sky Ranch and awaits a chance to escape. Ten days after the defeat of his forces, the Major heads above ground now using Loki's stolen identity, only to discover that he is surrounded by both Razorbacks and the 3D avatar of Boerner.

The book ends with his inevitable death and the start of a new world.

The event is held annually and marks the end of the academic year for the students at the Department of Game Design at [[Campus Gotland]], [[Uppsala University]]. Here they can showcase everything that they have learned during the year to a jury consisting of professionals from the game development industry, the gaming press and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GGC|url=http://www.gotlandgameconference.com/2011/info/about-ggc/|website=Gotland Game Conference 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have been a part of the jury include [[game design]] guru [[Ernest W.

==History==

The Department of Game Design on Gotland, Visby, has hosted a public event for displaying student projects since at least 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/revive-theme-park-2002/|title=Revive / Theme Park 2002|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2002-05-18|website=|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=260&amp;artikel=425019|title=Utställningen där man ska röra föremålen|last=|first=|date=2004-06-04|website=|publisher=Swedish Radio|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The event found a stable structure and was branded "'''Gotland Game Awards'''" in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edge Magazine (October 2009)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gotland Game Awards in EDGE Magazine!|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga09/2009/09/16/gotland-game-awards-in-edge-magazine/|website=Gotland Game Awards 2009|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-branded "'''Gotland Game Conference'''" in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/|title=Gotland Game Conference 2011|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-06-02|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/what-happened-to-the-gga/|title=What happened to the GGA|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-03-25|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when a presentation track was added and the event opened to public participation. In 2017 the GGC added an international summit for game educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotlandgameconference.com/2017/game-educators-summit/|title=Game Educators Summit (2017)|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2017-02-15|website=Gotland Game Conference|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; - with the intention of annually gathering game educations from across the world to collaborate and share experiences.  

==The event==

The event can be seen as consisting of four separate parts (spanning over multiple days);

*Public presentation of student projects to an international jury of developers, designers, academics, journalists etc.
*Followed by The Gotland Game Conference + showfloor, where all student games are made available to the jury and general audience. 
**The conference + show floor is roughly [http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/ modeled after the Game Developers Conference], but features only a single track of lectures.
*The Award Ceremony
*The GGC Party where students, jury and faculty celebrate their work and end of the school year.

A '''''guang''''' or '''''gong''''' is a particular shape used in [[Chinese art]] for vessels, originally made as [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] in the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BC), and sometimes later in [[Chinese porcelain]].  They are a type of [[ewer]] which was used for pouring [[rice wine]] at ritual [[banquet]]s, and often deposited as [[grave goods]] in high-status burial.  Examples of the shape may be described as ewers, ritual wine vessels, wine pourers and similar terms, though all of these terms are also used of [[Chinese bronzes#Wine vessels|a number of other shapes]], especially the smaller [[tripod]] ''[[Jue (vessel)|jue]]'' and the larger ''[[zun]]''.

The ''guang'' has a single thick foot, and a thick hollow body that represents one or more stylized animals (some have a head at both ends).  Guangs have a vertical handle at one end and a spout at the other, both [[zoomorphic]], and were often highly decorated with [[taotie]]. The handle of the guang is of often in the shape of the neck and head of an animal with stylized horns, and the spout of the vessel is in the form of the head of a creature whose mouth constitutes the end of the spout. The back and animal head at the pouring end usually are a removable lid, lifted off for pouring.

Their main period of use was during the Shang and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties, from around 1700 to 900 [[Common Era|BCE]]; thereafter the shape was sometimes used in a revivalist spirit.  The [[Ritual wine server (guang), Indianapolis Museum of Art, 60.43|Ritual wine server (''guang''), Indianapolis Museum of Art, 60.43]] is a fine example from about 1100 BC.

==Function and use==
The guang bronze ritual vessels of Early China were primarily used to house and serve wine during [[Ancestor Veneration in China|ancestor worship rituals]] in which the wine vapors were to be consumed by the deceased spirits and the actual physical contents to be enjoyed by the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gong (Bronze Work)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324176/gong|work=Britannica Encyclopaedia|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use, for storage and serving, is suggested through the form of the vessel. It is typically supported by one oval-shaped foot (supported more rarely by four legs), while the bronze itself takes the form of several animals and fantastical creatures metamorphosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great Bronze Age of China|year=1980|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York, NY|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each guang also has a neck and head, which serve as the pouring channel for the wine. A lid accompanies the vessel to complete the form. According to Robert Bagley, this lid is the chief idiosyncrasy, or characteristic, of the guang, for it is where the largest relief and decoration often takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagley|first=Robert|title=Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1987|publisher=Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this decor is significant in the meaning behind these works, the animal and fantastic creature ornamentation does not have an exact intended purpose for the bronzes, and is still left to interpretation.

Guang bronze vessels were used not only in life to honor the deceased, but also at times placed with the deceased in their grave. Because of this, the ritual vessels are not only [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] but useful to the living as well. They are both everyday functioning items, but also objects which serve religious and spiritual purposes.

==Décor==
The Guang is distinguishable by its zoomorphic lid and handle, and its one-footed base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawson|first=Jessica|title=Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual|year=1987|publisher=British Museums Publication Ltd.|pages=26–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal figure at the front of the lid is often a tiger or dragon, while the sculpted handle ranges in decoration from [[Legendary creature|fantastic creatures]] such as dragons to real animals such as rams, elephants, and the beaks of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freer and Sackler Galleries|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/explore/china/bronzes/gallery.asp#animalewers|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some guang lids also depict animals, typically birds, at the back of the vessel facing or transitioning into the handle. The animals on the lid and handle are presented [[Sculpture|"in the round"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the vessel is decorated in low- to mid-[[relief]]. This relief may depict the bodies belonging to creatures rendered on the lid or other complete animal figures. It is not uncommon for one animal to transition directly into another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower sections of the guang are also often divided into [[Register (sculpture)|registers]] and quadrants by [[flange]]s.&lt;ref name="Sackler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagley|first=Robert|title=Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1987|publisher=Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-674-80525-9|pages=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flange can be the central divider of a [[taotie]], a mask-like creature motif with curving horns and two dragon-like bodies stretching out to its sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Erdberg|first=Eleanor|title=Ancient Chinese Bronzes: Terminology and Iconology|year=1993|publisher=Fuldaer Verlagsanstalt|location=Fulda, Germany|isbn=3-87747-063-7|pages=42, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other surface embellishments include geometric background shapes such as the squared-spiral, the ''lei-wen''. These were used both to fill in empty space between more representational imagery and sometimes as smaller detail in those images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
===Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE)===
''See Also:'' [[Shang Dynasty]]

The guang, one of many types of Chinese ritual bronze vessels, is both late to come into the world of bronze vessels, and lasts a very short amount of time. The earliest account of guang vessels comes from late in the Shang dynasty, during the Anyang Period, spanning from c. 1300-1046 BCE. These vessels were distinct from other guang objects in early Chinese history because of their decoration. In the Shang Dynasty, the guang featured ornamentation which had not been fully developed. In a late twelfth century to early eleventh century guang, the decoration is lacking on the bottom register, but more innovative in design in the lid and upper registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asian Art Museum|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Asian Art Museum|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Qi Guang vessel from approximately the same time period, the decoration has been compartmentalized and unified in style, which utilizes conventional motifs of bird, dragon, and other animal imagery.

===Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 1045-771 BCE)===
''See Also:'' [[Western Zhou]]

The Western Zhou Dynasty is the final period in which guang vessels are known to have been made, due widely to the Ritual Revolution which occurred in the late Western Zhou dynasty, ultimately reducing the number of wine vessels being made. Before this disappearance, the guang saw changes in form, such as the ovular foot being sometimes replaced with four legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Bronze Age of China|year=1980|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York, NY|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration also becomes more refined, yet still using animal and fantastic imagery.

==Casting==
Early Chinese [[bronze]] vessels were cast using the piece-mold process. This process involved the artist forming the mold in pieces from clay, then connecting them to make one overall vessel form. With this method, the decoration on a vessel's surface had to be incised into the clay in reverse and negative. This means that images that would be raised on the surface of the metal would have to become depressions in the clay mold. The void inside the mold is then filled with molten metal, creating the positive. In contrast, the process of [[lost-wax casting]] allows an artisan to create a wax model of the desired object. The molten metal takes the place of the wax when cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art from Ritual. Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently it was necessary in the casting of large vessels to cast the main portion, include it in the construction of another mold, and then cast protrusions—such as the guang's handle—onto that piece.&lt;ref name="Sackler"/&gt;

guang (觥)vessel.

==Inscriptions==
From late Shang to early Zhou dynasty, the number of characters per inscription increased on these bronze vessels. These inscriptions recorded very important events (such as sacrifices), gifts by a king to his officials, praise accorded to ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Ping-hen, Liou. "Bronzes of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties". National Museum of History Republic of China, May 1, 1989.P9,P10&lt;/ref&gt; records for exchange/sale land, and political marriages to make stronger relationships.&lt;ref&gt;陈佩芬."认识古代青铜器".艺术家出版社.1995.P39 - P47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and cultural references==
After the [[Jia (vessel)#Ritual Revolution|"Ritual Revolution"]], some of the wine vessels were no longer in use in Western Zhou dynasty. The Guang vessel were only popular in Late Shang to Early Western Zhou dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Anthony J."Allen's Authentication of Ancient Chinese Bronzes".Walter Hirsh and Associates. December 31, 2001. P25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The film was mostly filmed at [[Virgil Middle School]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065810/locations IMDb Locations] on IMDb Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film draws some comparisons to a contemporary television program, ''[[Room 222]]'':  A new, black teacher joins a southern California high school; an attractive, sympathetic black female member of staff shows romantic interest; a militant black student is frequently involved in situations; issues of racism and integration are featured.  The film and television show even share actors ([[Ta-Tanisha]], [[Helen Kleeb]], [[Rob Reiner]]).  However, while ''Room 222'' is a comedy-drama, much milder in tone, Halls of Anger is purposefully aggressive, using deliberately controversial language and some forceful violence to highlight the very real and dangerous potential of unresolved racial conflict.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Roger Greenspun, the film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, "The picture initially portends sensationalism, with the racial scales reversed and the well-behaved white youngsters harassed and tormented by the black students. What steadies the whole thing is the excellent performance of Calvin Lockhart, as a sane, realistic Negro teacher who more or less holds together the teeming school and the picture itself...But the picture's urgent plea for racial sanity in the classroom is almost methodically blunted by the use of standard-seeming types. The few faculty whites are oafs or hard-heads. There is the pretty Negro teacher, nicely played by Janet MacLachlan, who supports and comforts Lockhart. As the fieriest black student and the spunkiest white newcomer, James A. Watson Jr. and Jeff Bridges do well in characterizations that rate more exploration."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E2DD1F31E236A05753C3A9629C946190D6CF Greenspun, Roger]. ''The New York Times'', film review, April 30, 1970. m Last accessed: March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Monica Sullivan praised the acting of Jeff Bridges, if not the film, "The young Bridges stands out in the cast, because his focus on his role is like a laser beam. He pours 100% of his energy into making his character believable and it is. The making of ''Halls Of Anger'' might be a more riveting experience than the film itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shoestring.org/mmi_revs/hallsofanger-ms-88166008.html Sullivan, Monica].

Lady '''Harriet Anne (Hooker) Thiselton-Dyer''' (1854–1945) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[botanical illustrator]].

[[File:Thiselton-Dyer Jasminum-didymum-1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''[[Jasminum didymum]]'' by Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer for ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'', 1878.]]

==Life and career==
Harriet Anne Hooker was born in 1854 to the botanist and explorer [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Frances Harriet Henslow]], who was the daughter of botanist and Cambridge University professor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. In 1877 she married the botanist [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer]] (later knighted), with whom she had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=scibio/&gt;

Thiselton-Dyer belonged to a generation of English women who transformed their interest in botany into professional careers.&lt;ref name=gaze/&gt; She studied with the noted botanical illustrator [[Walter Hood Fitch]], who was the lead artist for ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''. After Fitch resigned from the magazine in 1877 following a dispute with her father—for whom Fitch had been preparing illustrations for several books—Thiselton-Dyer stepped in.&lt;ref name=uw/&gt;&lt;ref name=index/&gt; She rendered almost 100 illustrations for publication during the period 1878–1880, helping to keep the magazine viable until [[Matilda Smith]] took over as lead illustrator.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

In 1894–95, Thiselton-Dyer painted some 550 copies of Brazilian botanist [[João Barbosa Rodrigues]]'s orchid paintings, which had been lent to her by the botanist [[Alfred Cogniaux]], who was using some of them to illustrate a work on Brazilian flora.&lt;ref name=mori/&gt; Unfortunately, the original drawings disappeared in Brazil sometime after Rodrigues's death and are now lost, making Thiselton-Dyer's copies—housed at Kew Gardens—a uniquely valuable resource on Rodrigues's work. In 1996, some of these copies were published to accompany an article on Rodrigues that appeared, fittingly enough, in ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine''.&lt;ref name=sprunger/&gt;

Thiselton-Dyer was also known as an accomplished [[gardening|gardener]].&lt;ref name=kramer2/&gt; In 1905 the Thiselton-Dyers moved to the Cotswolds. When her husband died in 1928, Harriet moved to Devonshire, where she died in 1945.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

In 2013, Thiselton-Dyer's work was included in the exhibition "The Feminine Perspective: Women Artists and Illustrators" at the Chicago Botanic Garden, alongside work by [[Henriette Vincent]], [[Ellen Robbins]], and others.&lt;ref name=rise/&gt;

'''Henry Fuseli''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[List of Royal Academicians|RA]]}} (German: '''Johann Heinrich Füssli'''; 7 February 1741 – 17 April 1825) was a Swiss painter, [[drawing|draughtsman]] and writer on art who spent much of his life in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Many of his works, such as ''The Nightmare'', deal with supernatural subject-matter. He painted works for [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery]], and created his own "Milton Gallery". He held the posts of Professor of Painting and Keeper at the Royal Academy. His style had a considerable influence on many younger British artists, including [[William Blake]].

==Biography==
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 011.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' was Fuseli's diploma work for the [[Royal Academy]], accepted 1790.]]

Fuseli was born in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, the second of 18 children. His father was [[Johann Caspar Füssli]], a painter of portraits and landscapes, and author of ''Lives of the [[Helvetia|Helvetic]] Painters''. He intended Henry for the church, and sent him to the Caroline college of Zurich, where he received an excellent classical education. One of his schoolmates there was [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], with whom he became close friends.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking orders in 1761 Fuseli was forced to leave the country as a result of having helped Lavater to expose an unjust magistrate, whose powerful family sought revenge. He travelled through [[Germany]], and then, in 1765, visited England, where he supported himself for some time by miscellaneous writing. Eventually, he became acquainted with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], to whom he showed his drawings. Following Reynolds' advice, he decided to devote himself entirely to art. In 1770 he made an art-pilgrimage to Italy, where he remained until 1778, changing his name from Füssli to the more Italian-sounding Fuseli.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Early in 1779 he returned to Britain, taking in Zürich on his way. In London he found a commission awaiting him from [[John Boydell|Alderman Boydell]], who was then setting up his [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]]. Fuseli painted a number of pieces for Boydell, and published an English edition of Lavater's work on [[physiognomy]]. He also gave [[William Cowper]] some valuable assistance in preparing a translation of [[Homer]]. In 1788 Fuseli married [[:File:Sophia Rawlins by Henry Fuseli.jpg|Sophia Rawlins]] (originally one of his models), and he soon after became an associate of the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], whose portrait he had painted, planned a trip with him to Paris, and pursued him determinedly, but after Sophia's intervention the Fuselis' door was closed to her forever. Fuseli later said "I hate clever women. They are only troublesome".&lt;ref&gt;Myrone, Martin (2001) ''Henry Fuseli''. London: Tate Gallery Publishing, p. 53. {{ISBN|1854373579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790 he became a full [[Academician]], presenting ''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' as his [[Reception piece|diploma work]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSESSION_=JZYSvRhQvBq&amp;_IXSR_=&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_MREF_=20058&amp;_IXSP_=1&amp;_IXFPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/''Thor battering the Midgard Serpent'', 1790.] Royal Academy of Arts Collections, 5 February 2014.

Four years later he was chosen as Keeper, and resigned his professorship, but resumed it in 1810, continuing to hold both offices until his death.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; As Keeper, he was succeeded by [[Henry Thomson (painter)|Henry Thomson]].

In 1799 Fuseli exhibited a series of paintings from subjects furnished by the works of [[John Milton]], with a view to forming a Milton gallery comparable to Boydell's Shakespeare gallery. There were 47 Milton paintings, many of them very large, completed at intervals over nine years. The exhibition proved a commercial failure and closed in 1800. In 1805 he brought out an edition of Pilkington's ''Lives of the Painters'', which did little for his reputation.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]], when on his visit to England, was much taken with Fuseli's works, and on returning to Rome in 1817 caused him to be elected a member of the first class in the Academy of St Luke.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==Works==
As a painter, Fuseli favoured the supernatural. He pitched everything on an ideal scale, believing a certain amount of exaggeration necessary in the higher branches of historical painting. In this theory he was confirmed by the study of [[Michelangelo]]'s works and [[Horse Tamers|the marble statues of the Monte Cavallo]],&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romeartlover.it/Vasi61.html Papal Palace on Monte Cavallo, Rome]. Retrieved 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when at [[Rome]], he liked to contemplate in the evening, relieved against a murky sky or illuminated by lightning.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Describing his style, the 1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' said that:&lt;blockquote&gt;His figures are full of life and earnestness, and seem to have an object in view which they follow with intensity. Like [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] he excelled in the art of setting his figures in motion. Though the lofty and terrible was his proper sphere, Fuseli had a fine perception of the ludicrous. The grotesque humour of his fairy scenes, especially those taken from ''A Midsummer-Night's Dream'', is in its way not less remarkable than the poetic power of his more ambitious works.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though not noted as a colourist,&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Fuseli was described as a master of light and shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie |first=C. R. |type=Letter to Miss Leslie December 1816|title=Autobiographical Recollections|editor=Tom Taylor|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|location=Boston|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than setting out his palette methodically in the manner of most painters, he merely distributed the colours across it randomly. He often used his pigments in the form of a dry powder, which he hastily combined on the end of his brush with oil, or [[turpentine]], or [[Water gilding|gold size]], regardless of the quantity, and depending on accident for the general effect. This recklessness may perhaps be explained by the fact that he did not paint in oil until the age of 25.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|''[[The Nightmare]],'' (1781), [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Fuseli painted more than 200 pictures, but he exhibited only a small number of them. His earliest painting represented "Joseph interpreting the Dreams of the Baker and Butler"; the first to excite particular attention was ''[[The Nightmare]]'', exhibited in 1782.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; He painted two versions, shown in the [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] article. Themes seen in ''The Nightmare'' were repeated in his 1796 painting, ''Night-Hag visiting the Lapland Witches''.

His sketches or designs numbered about 800; they have admirable qualities of invention and design, and are frequently superior to his paintings.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; In his drawings, as in his paintings, his method included deliberately exaggerating the proportions of the human body and throwing his figures into contorted attitudes. One technique involved setting down arbitrary points on a sheet, which then became the extreme points of the various limbs.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Notable examples of these drawings were made in concert with George Richmond when the two artists were together in Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He rarely drew the figure from life, basing his art on study of the antique and Michelangelo. He produced no [[Landscape art|landscapes]]—"Damn Nature! she always puts me out," was his characteristic exclamation—and painted only two portraits.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Many interesting anecdotes of Fuseli, and his relations to contemporary artists, are given in his ''Life'' by [[John Knowles (author)|John Knowles]] (1831).&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; He influenced the art of [[Fortunato Duranti]].

==Writings==
[[File:Henry Fuseli by Edward Hodges Baily, 1824, National Portrait Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|Henry Fuseli (aged 63) by [[Edward Hodges Baily]], 1824, National Gallery, London]]
In 1788 Fuseli started to write essays and reviews for the ''[[Analytical Review]]''. With [[Thomas Paine]], [[William Godwin]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and others interested in art, literature and politics, Fuseli frequented the home of [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], a [[publisher]] and prominent figure in radical British political and intellectual life. He also visited Allerton Hall in Liverpool, the home of [[William Roscoe]].

When Louis XVI was executed in France in 1793, Fuseli condemned the revolution as despotic and anarchic,{{where|date=September 2017}} although he had first welcomed it as a sign of "an age pregnant with the most gigantic efforts of character".

He was a thorough master of [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], and could write in all these languages with equal facility and vigour, although he preferred German as the vehicle of his thoughts. His principal work was his series of twelve lectures delivered to the Royal Academy, begun in 1801.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==Influence==
His pupils included [[John Constable]], [[Benjamin Haydon]], [[William Etty]], and [[Edwin Landseer]]. [[William Blake]], who was 16 years his junior, recognized a debt to him, and for a time many English artists copied his mannerisms.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Death==
After a life of uninterrupted good health&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; he died at the house of the Countess of Guildford on [[Putney|Putney Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45294 |title=Putney &amp;#124; Old and New London: Volume 6 (pp. 489–503) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 84, and was buried in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He was comparatively wealthy at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

[[File:HermanKlein1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herman Klein]]
'''Herman Klein''' (born '''Hermann Klein'''; 23 July 1856 – 10 March 1934) was an English music critic, author and teacher of singing.  Klein's famous brothers included [[Charles Klein|Charles]] and [[Manuel Klein]].  His second wife was the writer [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], and one of their children was the writer [[Denise Robins]].

For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London, becoming a lifelong proponent of the methods of [[Manuel García (baritone)|Manuel Garcia]] and helping to edit Garcia's book on the subject.  In 1876 he took up musical journalism, writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from 1881–1901, among other publications.  He also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.  From 1901 to 1909, Klein lived and taught singing in New York City, where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]''.  He was one of the first critics to take notice of the gramophone and was appointed "musical adviser" to Columbia Records in 1906 in New York.  He returned to England in 1909.

Klein wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs.  He was a noted authority on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].  In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Klein was born in [[Norwich]], Norfolk, [[East Anglia]], England the son of Hermann Klein senior and his wife Adelaide (née Soman). Apparently, the elder Klein emigrated from [[Riga|Riga, Latvia]],&lt;ref name=Stoneobit&gt;Stone, Christopher. "Herman Klein, July 23, 1856 – March 10, 1934", reprinted in Moran, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and home to a large community of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Jews such as the Kleins.  Once in Norwich, his father became a professor of foreign languages at the King Edward VI Grammar School, and his mother taught dance.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in New York (City and State)''. Lewis Historical Publ. Co., 1909, p. 787.  A petition from the Jews of Norwich, ''Norwich Petition For the Removal of the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Disabilities]] of the Jews'', 24 January 1848, includes the signature of a David Soman, boot and shoemaker, who may have been the father of Adelaide.  Transcription in the archives of [http://www.Jewishgen.org JewishGen].&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Klein's five brothers were Max, a violinist, [[Charles Klein|Charles]], a dramatist; [[Manuel Klein|Manuel]], a composer; [[Alfred Klein|Alfred]], an actor; and Philip.  They had a sister, Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;1871 and 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the uncle of producer Philip Klein (1888–1935).

Although his forename was frequently spelled as "Hermann" until [[World War I]], he "deprecated any foreign pronunciation of it and was proud of his British citizenship and upbringing".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;"Mr. Herman Klein: Music critic, teacher, and writer", ''[[The Times]]'', 12 March 1934, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The musical activities of Norwich, particularly its Festival and the Cathedral services, impressed him as a boy.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He was educated in Norwich and later in London.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U212414 "Klein, Herman",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Klein was married three times.  His first wife was Emily May Brown, a ballerina, with whom he had a daughter, Sibyl Klein, who became an actress;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/01/12/101965798.pdf "News of the Playhouses",] ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1903, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt; On 19 February 1890, he married a 17-year-old Australian-born heiress [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], later a popular writer, at the [[West London Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.JewishGen.org ''United Kingdom Marriages, 1838–1972''] at JewishGen.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their children included two writers:  Adrian Bernard L. Klein (1892–1969), who changed his name to [[Adrian Cornwell-Clyne]] and wrote books on photography and [[cinematography]], and Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985), who under her first married name, [[Denise Robins]], became a best-selling romantic novelist&lt;ref name=bear/&gt; and was the first president of the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]] (1960–1966).  Her daughter, Patricia Robins, is also a popular romance writer under the name [[Claire Lorrimer]].  Klein and Kathleen Clarice had another son, Daryl Kleyn (b. 1894).&lt;ref name=ykn&gt;Lorrimer, Claire. ''You Never Know'', autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, Kathleen Clarice began an affair with a young man, Herbert Arthur Berkeley Dealtry (b. 1878), who was a [[Worcestershire Regiment]] officer. When Klein became aware of it, he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. He was still affiliated with the West London Synagogue in 1901, the year of his divorce and his departure for New York.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://bearalley.blogspot.com/2007/09/kathleen-clarisa-cornwell.html Kathleen Clarisa Cronwell], bearalley online at bearalley.blogspot.com (accessed 13 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in British Jewry'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's third wife was Helene Fox, a [[Christian Science]] practitioner of Boston, Massachusetts, whom he married in 1905.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt;

Klein died in London, aged 77.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt;

===Career===
For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]] in London and also trained many professional singers privately.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 12 March 1934, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote songs and short works for piano. In 1874, Klein returned to Norwich temporarily to help his ailing mother. That year [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]] also moved into the same house as Klein at [[1 Bentinck Street]] in London. Klein became his student for four years and was closely associated with him for another six years.&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 15 March 1905, p. 18. Klein called Garcia "the greatest singing teacher who ever lived." For their address, see 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship became a transformative experience for Klein, who would recall Garcia and his singing principles in many of his writings throughout his life.  He helped edit Garcia's book on his singing method, published in English in 1872 (later revised by Klein and published as ''Hints on Singing'' in 1894).&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

In 1876 Klein took up musical journalism.  He began writing for ''The Examiner'' in 1879, and then for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (1881–1901), ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', ''The Citizen'', and the ''Lady's Pictorial''.  He was for many years a musical correspondent of ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

From 1901 to 1909, He lived in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;His brothers Charles and Manuel lived and worked in New York. Klein lived at 154 West 77th St. NYC.  See ''Musical Courier'', 5 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]'', taught singing,&lt;ref&gt;Klein's teacher Manuel Garcia wrote: "It is gratifying to me to know that the great American people appreciate the sound theories of the old school, and they will assuredly find in you one among its few capable exponents." See ''Musical Courier'', 11 December 1901, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a founder and first chairman of the [[New York Singing Teachers' Association|National Association of Teachers of Singing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 13 November 1907, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7gqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Klein+%22National+Association+of+Teachers+of+Singing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LPyI1aB5Zj&amp;sig=mikKU5nz8wGy0X8M6m0V7Jx4WAA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p-IfSrCjC8Sktgfg9IHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 ''Papers and Proceedings of the Music Teachers' National Association''], pp. 172–76, Music Teachers National Association (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first critics to take notice of the [[phonograph|gramophone]].  He was appointed "musical adviser" to [[Columbia Records]] in 1906 in New York and was responsible for introducing [[David Bispham]], [[Anton van Rooy]], [[Lillian Blauvelt]] and [[Ruth Vincent]] and others to the recording studio.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt; Klein eventually came to hold an unfavourable view of American musical life and returned to Britain in May 1909, continuing to teach and write.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs. In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.&lt;ref name=gramophone73&gt;Wimbush, Roger.

Among his other activities, Klein listed "Inventor of the Phono-Vocal Method of learning singing with the aid of a gramophone" and "Past Grand Organist of Grand Lodge of Freemasons".&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He was a member of the Critics' Circle, of which he was President and also Chairman of its musical committee.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;

[[File:JourneyContinued.jpg|thumb|First UK edition (publ. [[OUP]])]]

'''''Journey Continued: An Autobiography''''' is the second part of [[Alan Paton]]'s autobiography, the first being ''[[Towards the Mountain]]''.

Paton had completed the writing and correction of the volume, but he died before its publication in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Journey Continued by Alan Paton, Oxford University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-19-219237-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

The book addresses a wide variety of topics, personal, professional, philosophical, and political. For example, it discusses the way in which Paton's ''[[Cry, The Beloved Country]]'' was adapted for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/02/books/reflections-on-beloved-country.html|date=1988-04-02|access-date=2016-12-12|last=Battersby|first=John D.|title=Reflections On 'Beloved Country'|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also discusses the Christian basis for Paton's activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-14/books/bk-134_1_alan-paton|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-01-14|title=JOURNEY CONTINUED: An Autobiography by Alan Paton|access-date=2016-12-12|first=Charles|last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ngwenya /&gt;

''Journey Continued'' outlines long Paton's and deep involvement with the [[Liberal Party of South Africa]], and his views on [[liberalism]] and its distinctness from other political philosophies.&lt;ref name=ngwenya&gt;{{cite journal|title=The liberal‐Christian vision in Alan Paton's autobiography|journal=Current Writing: Text and Reception in Southern Africa|doi=10.1080/1013929X.1997.9678021|first=Thengani H|last=Ngwenya|volume=9|date=1997|pages=36–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peace Profile: The African Resistance Movement|first=Travis K.|last=Sharp|pages=455–462|doi=10.1080/10402650500374793|journal=[[Peace Review]]|volume=17|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=

==Quotations==

{{Quote|text="Between communists and liberals ... there is a fundamental incompatibility. ... A liberal cannot accept that the use of any means is justifiable if the end is good; a communist can. A liberal shrinks from the idea of a centrally controlled society, and a centrally controlled economy; a communist does not. The liberal belief in the separation of powers is not acceptable to communists. A liberal believes that a centrally controlled economy kills private initiative and drive, and leads to a drab and dreary existence. A liberal believes in the rule of law, the communist believes in the rule of the party." |author=Alan Paton|source=''Journey Continued''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journey Continued: An Autobiography|last=Paton|first=Alan|isbn=9780192192370|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=68|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Lainzer Tiergarten''' is a 24.50 km² (6,054-[[acre]])&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm Location and size description on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124041/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife preserve]] in the southwest corner of [[Vienna, Austria]], 80% of it being covered in [[woodland]]. It dates back to 1561, when [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] created it as a fenced-in hunting ground for his family to use. Since 1919, it has been open to the public. Its name consists of its location by the [[Lainz]] district of Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th District]], and ''Tiergarten'', which means zoo (literally, "animal garden").

==Location==

The Lainzer Tiergarten is located mostly in Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th district]], with a small adjacent portion lying in [[Laab im Walde]], [[Lower Austria]]. The [[Wien River]] is located to its north, the [[Liesingbach]] to its south.

==History==

Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] created the Lainzer Tiergarten in 1561. He had wooden fence built to enclose an area that he could use as a private hunting preserve. In 1781, a stone wall replaced the wooden fence. After the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Austrian government declared the grounds a public nature preserve, though between 1940 and 1955, the entire grounds were closed to the public. Until 1973 access to the preserve required the payment of an admission fee. Since then admission is free.

A large portion of the Lainzer Tiergarten was lost after [[World War I]], when the ''Friedenstadt'' ("Peace City") neighborhood was constructed in its eastern portion. The old wall can still be seen in the ''Hörndlwald'' woods east of the Lainzer Tor.

Due to construction of the [[Westautobahn]] in the 1960s, a corner in the northwest of the preserve was also lost. This time there was compensation, however, as a portion of the ''Laaber Wald'', adjacent to the southwest corner, was annexed.

==Wildlife==

Today the Lainzer Tiergarten is home to between 800 and 1,000 [[wild boar]], 200 to 250 [[fallow deer]], approximately 700 [[mouflon]]s, and 80 to 100 [[red deer]] (elk).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm Wildlife information on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124509/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gates==
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten2.jpg|thumb|This view of Vienna from the preserve shows the wall in the bottom foreground.]]

The preserve is surrounded by approximately {{convert|22|km|mi|sp=us}} of wall. There are seven gates, with different operating hours. Clockwise these are:

* Lainzer Tor (main gate)
* Gütenbachtor
* Laaber Tor
* Pulverstampftor
* Nikolaitor
* Sankt Veiter Tor

The entire preserve is open for approximately nine months of the year, from early March to early November. In the remaining months only the park around the Hermesvilla, accessible from the Lainzer Tor, is open. Between Christmas and the New Year, the entire park opens, but is only accessible from the Lainzer Tor and Nikolaitor.

===Lainzer Tor===
[[Image:Lainzer Tor.jpg|thumb|The Lainzer Tor]]
[[Image:LainzerTorTransitAccess.png|thumb|Public transportation access to the Lainzer Tor]]
As it is open year-round, and is home to a visitor center, the Lainzer Tor is the preserve's main gate. It is also the origin and the terminus of a {{convert|2.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} walk to the Hermesvilla, which can often also be ridden via horse carriage. Public restrooms are also located near the gate, as is a water fountain. This is also one of two gates that has a parking lot.

The Lainzer Tor is located at the end of Hermesstraße, and is reachable using the 55A bus, which connects the gate to the 60 and 62 trams line at 15- to 20-minute intervals. These tram lines can be taken from the stop Speising, Hermesstraße, and connect to multiple [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] and [[Vienna S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] lines. Line 62 can also be taken directly from the [[Vienna Staatsoper]] to Hermesstraße.

===Gütenbachtor===
The Gütenbachtor is located on Gütenbachstraße, and accesses the southeastern corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It also features a water fountain and a parking lot, but is a 45-minute walk from the nearest public transportation, regional bus lines 253 and 354.

===Laaber Tor===
The Laaber Tor is located by the [[Lower Austria]]n town of [[Laab am Walde]]. It accesses a separate corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten that was added in the 1960s as a compensation for territory that was lost in the north of the preserve when a highway was built. Visitors using this gate will pass the Dianator, which was the gate in this corner before the annexation of additional land. The Laaber Tor also has a water fountain.

Similar to the Gütenbachtor, the only public transportation within reach is the regional bus line 253, which is a 15-minute walk from this gate.

===Pulverstampftor===
The Pulverstampftor is located in the northwest corner of the preserve, near the [[Auhof]] neighborhood of Vienna's [[Penzing (Vienna)|14th district]]. It features a water fountain, and can be accessed from the ''Umspannwerk Auhof'' stop of the regional bus line 50B from [[Hütteldorf]] (five-minute walk).

===Nikolaitor===
Due to its location near the [[Hütteldorf]] railway station, the Nikolaitor is an important gate of the Lainzer Tiergarten. Hütteldorf can be accessed with the U-Bahn U4, S-Bahn S45, S50 and S60, tram line 49, as well as multiple bus lines. From the station it is a 10-minute walk across the [[Wien River]] to Nikolaigasse. This gate also features a water fountain.

===Adolfstor===
The Adolfstor was located along the eastern wall of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It is now closed.

===Sankt Veiter Tor===
The Sankt Veiter Tor is directly accessible using a special hourly-served branch of the 54A bus line from the Ober Sankt Veit [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station. Higher-frequented bus lines to Ober St. Veit and the terminus of the 62 tram line, Lainz Wolkersbergenstraße, are available by walking down Hanschweg to Stock im Weg.

==Locations in the preserve==
[[Image:Hubertuswarte.JPG|thumb|200px|The Hubertuswarte]]
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten4.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the visit of the Japanese Imperial Couple in 2002]]

There are three restaurants, two scenic viewpoints, and one museum located within the Lainzer Tiergarten.

===Hermesvilla and park===
[[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] commissioned the construction of the [[Hermesvilla]], which was completed in 1886, and served as a getaway mansion for his [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|wife]]. Today it serves as a museum and also contains a restaurant and café, which is highly frequented due to its close location to the Lainzer Tor. The property around the Hermesvilla is a special area of the Lainzer Tiergarten, fenced off from the rest of the preserve. Separate gates on the paths leading deeper into the park allow access to the larger section when this is open.

===Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus===
Besides the Hermesvilla, visitors to the Lainzer Tiergarten can also eat and drink at the Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus restaurants. These are located deeper in the reserve than the Hermesvilla, but also have full menus.

===Hubertuswarte===
The Hubertuswarte is an [[observation tower]], built in 1927, and located on the Kaltbründel Berg, the highest point in the preserve (508 meters/1667 ft). From the top of the tower, visitors have a 360-degree view of the region, including Vienna and neighboring villages.

===Wiener Blick===
Closer to the city side of the Lainzer Tiergarten, the Wiener Blick offers a view of the city from 434&amp;nbsp;m (1424&amp;nbsp;ft). In July 2002, this observation point was visited by the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Akihito]] and his wife [[Empress Michiko of Japan|Michiko]].

[[File:Katharine Hepburn promo pic.jpg|thumb|[[Katharine Hepburn]] won four [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Awards for Best Actress]], more than any other thespian in the history of the [[Academy Awards]].]]
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] has given [[Academy Awards]] to actors and actresses for their performances in films since its inception. Throughout the history of the Academy Awards, there have been actors and actresses who have received multiple Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], or [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/acting2ormore.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308040052/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/acting2ormore.html |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |title=Acting Two or More Awards |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |date=March 8, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only restriction is that actors cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance.&lt;ref name="Rule6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/rules/rule06.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113142942/http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/rules/rule06.html |archivedate=January 13, 2008 |title=Rule 6 – 80th Academy Awards |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was implemented after [[Barry Fitzgerald]] received a Best Actor and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in ''[[Going My Way]]''.&lt;ref name="TwoinOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/actingtwoinone.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112090619/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/actingtwoinone.html |archivedate=January 12, 2008 |title=Persons nominated in two acting categories in the same year |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |date=March 8, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, 41 actors and actresses have received two or more Academy Awards in acting categories. [[Katharine Hepburn]] leads the way with four Best Actress awards.&lt;ref name="CNNHepburnDeath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/29/hepburn.obit/index.html |title=Katharine Hepburn dead at 96 |publisher=CNN |author=Allen, Jamie |date=June 30, 2003 |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323130032/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/29/hepburn.obit/index.html |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five have won three Academy Awards: [[Ingrid Bergman]] (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award),&lt;ref name="NYTBergmanAwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/5652/Ingrid-Bergman/awards|title=Ingrid Bergman – Awards|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Brennan]] (three Best Supporting Actor awards),&lt;ref name="MoviefoneBrennanAwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/celebrity/walter-brennan/1027197/awards|title=Walter Brennan – Awards|publisher=[[Moviefone]]|accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Nicholson]] (two Best Actor awards and one Best Supporting Actor award),&lt;ref name="NYTNicholsonAwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/104455/Jack-Nicholson/awards|title=Jack Nicholson – Awards|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meryl Streep]] (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award), and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] (three Best Actor awards). Brennan was the first to receive three or more [[Academy Awards]] in [[13th Academy Awards|1940]], followed by Hepburn in [[41st Academy Awards|1968]], Bergman in [[47th Academy Awards|1974]], Nicholson in [[70th Academy Awards|1997]], Streep in [[84th Academy Awards|2011]], and most recently Day-Lewis in [[85th Academy Awards|2012]]. Of the six, only Nicholson, Streep, and Day-Lewis are still living.

While there is no restriction on a performer winning the Best Actor/Actress and Best Supporting Actor/Actress awards in the same year for two different roles in two different movies, this has yet to happen.

Klimt was a member of the [[Vienna Secession]], a group of artists that broke away from the traditional way of painting.

| [[File:Raphael missing.jpg|200px]] || [[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|''Portrait of a Young Man'']] by [[Raphael]] || 1940s || [[Poland]] || ''Portrait of a Young Man'' is a painting in oil on [[panel painting|panel]], probably from 1513 to 1514, by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] [[Old Master]] painter and architect Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino better known simply as [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name="houpt49"&gt;Houpt, Simon ''et al.'' (2006). ''Museum of the Missing,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting was plundered by the [[Nazi]]s in [[Poland]]. The subject's identity is unverified, but many scholars have traditionally regarded it as Raphael's [[self-portrait]]. The facial features are perceived by specialists as compatible with, if not clearly identical to, the only undoubted self-portrait by Raphael in his [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' at the Vatican, identified as such by [[Vasari]]. If it is a self-portrait, no hint is given of Raphael's profession; the portrait shows a richly dressed and "confidently-poised" young man.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Roger ''et al.'' (1983). ''Raphael'', p. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent times, a book about [[Nazi plunder]] by [[Lynn H. Nicholas]] and a documentary film by the same title, ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'', suggested that if the painting were to reappear today, it would be worth in excess of US$100M.|| $100,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]: [https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/  ''The Rape of Europa.''], 2006 film, aired November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|| Falsely reported to have been found 1 August 2012, the location is still unknown.

'''''Martyrs of the Alamo''''' (also known as '''''The Birth of Texas''''') is a 1915 American [[Historical film|historical]] [[War film|war drama film]] written and directed by [[Christy Cabanne]]. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including [[Sam De Grasse]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]] and [[Alfred Paget]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/M/MartyrsOfTheAlamo1915.html|title=The Martyrs of the Alamo; or, "The Birth of Texas"|publisher=silentera.com|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in ''[[The Lamb]]'', was released prior to this picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/16586 | publisher=American Film Institute | title=The Martyrs of the Alamo | accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features the [[Siege of Béxar]], [[Battle of the Alamo]] and [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in [[San Antonio]] in 1836 as a group of ill-mannered drunks.  One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her.  The white woman reports the incident to her husband, [[Almeron Dickinson]] who in turn shoots the Mexican officer.  In his book ''Remembering the Alamo'', author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Richard R. |title=Remembering the Alamo: Memory, Modernity, and Thew Master Symbol|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0-292-78196-2|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the film is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="silentera" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], used by [[André Gide|Gide]] to demonstrate the technique of ''mise en abyme'']]
In [[Western art history]], '''''Mise en abyme''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz ɑ̃n‿abim}}; also '''''mise en abîme''''') is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [[heraldry]] and literally means "placed into [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [[André Gide]].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [[mirror]]s, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinhardt|first=Dagmar|title=Youtopia. a Passion for the Dark: Architecture at the Intersection Between Digital Processes and Theatrical Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38_ZvEwnGtQC&amp;pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Freerange Press|isbn=978-0-9808689-1-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Droste effect]], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is named after the 1904 [[Droste]] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:Royal Arms of United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the United Kingdom 1816–37]]
In the terminology of [[heraldry]], the ''abyme'' is the center of a [[coat of arms]]. The term ''mise en abyme'' then meant put in the center. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see [[Droste effect]]).

A complex example of ''mise en abyme'' is seen in the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#After the Acts of Union 1707|for the period 1816–1837]], as used by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The [[crown of Charlemagne]] is placed ''en abyme'' within the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of [[Hanover]], which in turn is ''en abyme'' within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern [[coat of arms of Russia]], which holds a [[sceptre]] topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre.

==Medieval examples==
[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia075.jpg|thumb|300px|Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

While [[art historian]]s working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic "self awareness", medievalists tended not to use it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] dated to the year 944. To the left, [[Justinian I]] offers the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, [[Constantine I]] offers the city of [[Constantinople]] (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles ''Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself'',&lt;ref name='mise'/&gt; in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] in the [[Vatican Museum]], which features Cardinal [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] as the giver of the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical theory and art history==
In [[Western art history]], ''mise en abyme'' is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; "[[recursion|recursive]]" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author [[André Gide]] who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.&lt;ref name='mise'&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf Medieval ''mise-en-abyme'': the object depicted within itself (collection of papers)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] and literary forms such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of the "play within a play" device in ''[[Hamlet]]'', where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase ''mise en abyme'' was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'' by [[Lucien Dällenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Dällenbach, ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'', Paris, Seuil, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
''Mise en abyme'' occurs within a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. ''Mise en abyme'' is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Mise-en-abime" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of [[deconstruction]]. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of ''mise en abyme''. The film being made within the film refers, through its ''[[mise en scène]]'', to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/3265.ctl|Hayward, Susan. ''Cinema Studies Key Concepts''. New York: Routledge, 2006.] Accessed 2009-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' (1973) by [[François Truffaut]].

In [[film]], the meaning of ''mise en abyme'' is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a "dream within a dream". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is [[false awakening|still dreaming]]. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as ''mise en abyme''. This is seen in the film ''[[eXistenZ]]'' where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).  Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s written works (particularly "[[The Purloined Letter]]") in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Band of Outsiders]]'' (1964). 

In [[literary criticism]], ''mise en abyme'' is a type of [[frame story]], in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Chambers |title=Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction |year=1984 |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/story-and-situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

'''Murderabilia''', also known as '''murderbilia''', is a term identifying [[Collecting|collectibles]] related to [[murders]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, murderers or other [[violent crimes]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, coined by Andy Kahan, director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sally |last=Macdonald  |title= Crime Victims Advocate Moved From Mayor's Office to HPD |url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/news/local/100716-crime-victims-director-moved-from-mayor's-office-to-hpd |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Houston]] Police Department's Crime Victims Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barrett | first=Grant | title=The Official Dictionary of Unofficial English: A Crunk Omnibus for Thrillionaires and Bampots for the Ecozoic Age|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|date=2006-05-23|isbn=978-0-07-145804-7|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1629655,00.html | title=Cracking Down on 'Murderabilia' | last=Hylton | first=Hilary | date=2007-06-05 | work=TIME | accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectibles==

Buyers typically seek [[collectibles]] that are either artifacts used or owned by murderers and items (often artwork) created by them. According to crime writer Leigh Lundin, buyers may be interested in the macabre, but many believe such artifacts offer power and control.&lt;ref name="merch"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| title=Merchandising Murder | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2012/01/merchandising-murder.html |work=Murderabilia | publisher=SleuthSayers |location=Orlando | date=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Virtually anything once owned or created  by mass murderers or serial killers can be marketed, such as vehicles, artwork and weapons used in crimes. Clothing is also in high demand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Potter  |title= Outrage – and insight – over Hesston shooter ‘murderabilia’ |url= http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article165309057.html|date=August 3, 2017 |accessdate=August 30, 2017|work=Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly clothes worn during crimes themselves.

== Controversy ==

In May 2001, [[eBay]] banned the sale of murderabilia items, forcing the industry underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hilary |last=Hylton  |title= Cracking Down On "Murderabilia"|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1629655,00.html|date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, a serial killer's artwork was sold [[online auction|online]] in [[Massachusetts]]. State lawmakers proposed to block the activity, setting off a debate on free speech rights of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Online auction of killer's art spurs debate |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5956202-7.html |publisher=[[CNET Networks#CNET News|CNET News]] |date=November 16, 2005 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, American school shooter [[Wayne Lo]] caused controversy after it was found that he was selling his artwork on a web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan  |last=Copulsky  |title= Wayne Lo 'murderabilia' site causes controversy |url=http://www.llamaledger.com/news/2007/05/16/News/Wayne.Lo.murderabilia.Site.Causes.Controversy-2902645.shtml |work=Llama Ledger |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Senators [[John Cornyn]] of Texas and [[Amy Klobuchar]] of [[Minnesota]] teamed up to introduce a bill in Congress that would outlaw the sale of murderabilia. The bill is called the "Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act of 2010," and came after several individual fights over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James  |last=Schneider  |title= Senators Try to Halt Sale of Gruesome 'Murderabilia' |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/18/senators-try-halt-sale-gruesome-murderabilia/ |date=June 18, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the United States Government auctioned off personal items which belonged to [[Ted Kaczynski]] which were found in his [[Montana]] cabin upon his capture in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Lohr  |title= Unabomber's Criminal Collectibles Up For Auction |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136616438/unabombers-criminal-collectibles-up-for-auction |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auction took place entirely online. The proceeds went to victims and victims' families of Kaczynski's crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Vinciguerra  |title= The ‘Murderabilia’ Market |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/weekinreview/05murderabilia.html?_r=3&amp;src=twrhp |date=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[George Zimmerman]], killer of [[Trayvon Martin]] (who was ultimately acquitted of murder charges), sold the handgun that was used in [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|the killing]] for $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36354206&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'''&lt;ref&gt;Published in Neunzert 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[performance art|performance artist]] [[Lubo Kristek]] and also a series of his [[happening]]s. The artist started his happening series in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage.&lt;ref name="p121"&gt;Putová 2013, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
The first action was held in the city of [[Znojmo]]. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage). 

The second happening took place in public area – on the pavement of Mariahilfer Straße in [[Vienna]] in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina’s [[pointe shoe]]s into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the [[avant-garde]] sense.

The assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschloß Riegersburg, today [[Schloss Ruegers]] (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.

In 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, [[Landsberg am Lech]]. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled ''Third Eye of Distant Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Manuela|last=Rieger|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/landsberg/Kunst-zum-Nachdenken-id3697011.html|title=Kunst zum Nachdenken|website=Augsburger Algemeine|publisher=|date=12 May 2008|access-date=16 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In the happening a new character appeared, Temptation (played by the prima ballerina of the Brno National Theatre Jana Přibylová), who gives the spectators electronic devices from a pink sack and who suddenly turnes into the devil). In one of the last scenes, this character toys with a representation of human fate – a black figurine – which she throws to the ground as soon as she tires of her plaything. At the end of the happening, Kristek carried the pink sack full of electronic refuse to the altar of the Landsberg Church of the Holy Cross. In this way, he emphasised the sharp contrast between our ancestors´ legacy and what will remain after the current epoch.&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;Putová 2018, [http://glyptotheque.com/index.php/meeting-point/requiem-for-mobile-telephones Chapter: Meeting place – Requiem for Mobile Telephones]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following happening took place in a Polish city of [[Sucha Beskidzka]]  in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a [[cult]] or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this “modern god” on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] the mobile phones.

{{Quote|The artist destroys the mobiles in the happenings. He disposes of them like refuse, but at the same time, he applies the ritual principle of sacrifice. The participants of the happening then “receive” the destroyed telephone (analogous with the torn up god) or even “consume” it via their reconnection in the creative process (analogous with the resurrection). The characters and spectators sew the mobiles on to the travelling assemblage, and they become co-creators of a work of art with a shape that changes from event to event. So through his message ''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'', Kristek achieves what he foretold in his picture ''The Moss Covered Telephone Call''.

Residuals are calculated and administered by [[Film industry|industry]] [[trade union]]s like [[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]], and the [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1 =Grimes |first1 =Gerlinda |title= Can a TV actor live off royalties forever?|url= https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/can-tv-actor-live-off-royalties-forever.htm | website =HowStuffWorks|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is typically used in the plural form.

==History==

Technological advances gave rise to residual payments, and their evolution can be traced in terms of those technologies.

===Radio===
Residuals were established in [[Radio in the United States|U.S. network radio]]. [[Live radio]] programs with nationwide audiences were generally performed either two or three times to account for different [[time zone]]s between the east and west coasts of the United States. The performers were paid for each performance. After audio "[[transcription disc]]" technology became widely available in the late 1930s, it was initially used to make recordings to send to radio stations that were not connected to the live network. As sound quality improved, radio networks began using them for time-delaying west coast broadcasts, eventually eliminating the need for multiple performances. The performers were kept on standby and paid for a second performance in case there were technical problems. This established the precedent for residual payments from recorded performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=5 August 2007
|accessdate=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the early 1950s, a similar transition occurred in television. Initially, most television broadcasts were either live performances or broadcasts of older films originally produced for theaters. [[Kinescope]] recordings were made of live east coast performances so they could be broadcast several hours later on the west coast, which also made it possible to broadcast these shows later as many times as they wanted. In 1952, residual payments were extended to these television [[rerun]]s, thanks in large part to [[Ronald Reagan]], whose first term as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) ran from 1947 to 1952.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Residual resentment slows Hollywood talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-residuals16oct16-story.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] negotiated residuals for up to five reruns for made-for-TV shows.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt;

That said, film actors were still not paid residuals for reruns. As Americans increasingly watched TV at home instead of going out to the movies, movie attendance plummeted by over 65% between 1948 and 1959, [[film studio|studios]] were grappling with decreased revenues, and actors felt like they were being deprived of significant income that was owed to them. The studios, however, took a hardline stance on residuals for movie actors due to their shrinking revenue as well as the fact that if they paid residuals to actors, they would also have to pay directors and [[screenwriter]]s as well.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federman|first1=Wayne|title=What Reagan Did for Hollywood|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/what-reagan-did-for-hollywood/248391/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stalemate led SAG actors to re-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] as SAG President in fall of 1959. Reagan asked SAG for a [[Strike action|strike]] authorization in February and the actors agreed on a work-stop date for March 7, 1960, Hollywood's first-ever industry-wide strike. Starting with [[Universal Pictures]], studios ended up agreeing to film residuals, but only for movies made after 1960s. They would issue a one-time payout of $2.25 million for movies made between 1948 and 1960, and movies made before 1948 would not be eligible for any residuals. (Unrelated to residuals, Reagan also secured [[health insurance]] and [[pension]]s for SAG actors.) This upset older actors like [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Bob Hope]], who blamed Reagan and the SAG board for weak negotiating, but in April 1960 SAG voted to accept the offer and returned to work.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

In 1988, WGA launched [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|its longest strike]], lasting 22 weeks, over a disagreement over residuals for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries. The new contract allowed writers two formulas for calculating foreign residuals: the existing formula ($4,400 maximum for a one-hour show) or the new formula (1.2% of the producer's foreign sales). On the other hand, domestic residuals were adjusted to take a sliding scale, which would incentivize producers to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicate]] one-hour shows, whose revenue performance was poor, to independent TV stations.&lt;ref name="nyt1988"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|title=Writers Ratify Contract, Ending Longest Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/movies/writers-ratify-contract-ending-longest-strike.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=8 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New media===
[[File:Paramount front gate WGA strike Nov 12 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front gate of [[Paramount Studios]] on November 12, 2007, during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–08 WGA strike]]]]

In 2007, the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), the industry bargaining group that deals with the trade unions, called for an end to the current residual payment system in response to the rise of online media. Instead, it proposed that residuals be pooled so the studios would recoup their costs paying the actors, directors, and writers based on a profit-based formula,&lt;ref name="ciep"&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Cieply | first1 =Michael | title =Hollywood Officials Seek End to System Of Paying Residuals| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12hollywood-web.html |accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would solve the problem that residuals remain the same despite decreases in TV profits.&lt;ref name="handel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Residuals Revelation: Network Primetime Residuals as Chilly for SAG/AFTRA and DGA as WGA|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/residuals-revelation-network-primetime-residuals-214646|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) decided to negotiate for higher residual payments. The AMPTP adamantly opposed extending residuals to online movie and TV show sales for at least three years, citing the need to "adapt to the realities of the marketplace, the new demands from our audiences and new technologies",&lt;ref name = "latimes"/&gt; while a WGA representative countered that they "already had effective business models".&lt;ref name = "ciep"/&gt;

In 2011, SAG-AFTRA, WGA, and DGA negotiations kept residuals for network primetime TV (considered "among the most lucrative" residuals) frozen at previous levels.&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

== Process ==

Residuals are administered by the [[labor union|unions]]—[[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), and the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA)—for their members, who are paid between one and four months after the air date. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]], it processes around 1.5 million residual checks a year.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; WGA receives between 100 and 5,000 residual checks a day.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt; The DGA processes "hundreds of thousands of checks" a year, and in 2016 it processed $300 million in residuals for its members.&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;{{cite web|title= Residuals |url=https://www.dga.org/The-Guild/Departments/Residuals.aspx|website=Directors Guild of America |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual calculation is complex and depends on several variables, including guild membership, initial payment, time spent, type of production (e.g., network TV, DVD, ad-supported streaming, online purchases), and whether it involves a domestic or foreign market. Additionally, residuals change a lot: guilds negotiate new contracts with the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|AMPTP]] every three years, and residuals for primetime TV tend to increase every year because they are "directly or indirectly keyed to salary minimums, which increase several percent per year".&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

In acting, [[Extra (acting)|extras]] are generally not eligible, but [[stunt performer]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, singers, and actors with lines or scripted physical interactions with characters ("supporting actors" or "day players") are eligible.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residuals FAQ|url=https://www.sagaftra.org/content/residuals-faq|website=SAG-AFTRA|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal performers generally get larger residuals.&lt;ref name="market"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andres |first1= Tommy| title=How do actors make money off residuals?|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2014/10/24/business/ive-always-wondered/how-do-actors-make-money-residuals|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Marketplace|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the more prominent the actor, the more generous the residual. Big stars like [[Tom Cruise]], for example, would get a portion of DVD sales in addition to his "regular" residuals.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Internet Age|date=2011|publisher=Hollywood Analytics|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781438233857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZvLwaBN1uAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All "credited" writers are eligible for residuals, and the specific credit determines the amount of amount. For example, the "written by" credit yields a 100% residual allocation, "screenplay/teleplay by" yields a 75%, and "adaptation by" yields 10%.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{cite book|title=Residual Survivals Guide|date=October 2016|publisher=Writers Guild of America|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/members/finances/residualssurvival2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Not super relevant?
Disabled members are not supposed to have [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]) removed from their residuals. Some studios do comply if the disabled member contacts the movie studio, but there are other studios that choose to violate the IRS rule.
--&gt;
=== Examples ===
Residual payments can sometimes be very small if the role was small or the movie or show was not successful. For example, actor [[Jeff Cohen (actor)|Jeff Cohen]] received a residual check for $0.67 after appearing in one episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''; he took it to a former bar in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] called "Maeve's Re$iduals", which used to trade free drinks for any [[SAG-AFTRA]] residual checks for less than $1.&lt;ref name="bkstg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jeff|title=Calculating SAG Residuals| url= https://www.backstage.com/news/calculating-sag-residuals/|accessdate=3 February 2018 |work=Backstage|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Bob Gunton]], who played Warden Norton in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', noted that the movie, one of the most-rerun films, generated "close to six figures" in residuals for him in 2004, ten years after the movie was released, and even as of 2014, that he continued to receive "a very substantial income".&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=The Actors From 'Shawshank Redemption' Still Make A 'Steady' Income Off TV Residual Checks|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/actors-from-shawshank-redemption-residual-pay-2014-6|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Business Insider|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, actor [[Lisa Kudrow]] of ''[[Friends]]'' was ordered to pay $1.6 million to her former manager, who argued that he was owed 5% of Kudrow's residuals earnings from work that he negotiated.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title='Friends' Star Lisa Kudrow Loses $1.6 Million Lawsuit|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/friends-star-lisa-kudrow-loses-16-million-lawsuit/story?id=22681593|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=ABC News|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends star Lisa Kudrow must pay ex-manager $1.6m|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26381575|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=BBC|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using figures that were publicly disclosed, one analyst estimated Kudrow's residuals to be at least $2.3 million, and likely much higher.&lt;ref name="market"/&gt;

'''Acropolis Roquepertuse''' is a historical religious center for the [[Celts]]. It is located near the city of [[Velaux]], north of [[Marseille]] and west of [[Aix-en-Provence]], in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[région]] of southern France. Roquepertuse had no domiciles available for worshippers and has been used as a sanctuary where only priests may have lived permanently. It was destroyed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in 124 BC and was discovered in 1860. Most of the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] were done in 1923 by [[Henri de Gérin-Ricard]].

==Findings==
{{prose|section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Roquepertuse. Statue de guerrier.jpg|thumb|250px|Seated warrior from Roquepertuse]]

Officially, the findings have been dated to the 3rd century BC. This age has been established based on [[Celt]]ic expansion into the area, which took place around the same time. However, the clothing and gestures of certain [[statue]]s found at the site suggest that they date from the 5th or 6th century BC, instead. These statues are distinguished by their unique seated position, comparable to the upright and cross-legged seated position found in statues depicting the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

# A platform of 50 m by 22 m paved with flat stones including a couple of reused headstones, divided in the middle by a staircase made of large blocks of stone. Stone walls to the left and to the right of the stairs formed a terrace, probably one of several which had originally belonged to the complex.
# On the platform was what is variously called a portal, or door frame, or portico with pillars, of limestone. Its columns had cavities in which human stone masks, as well as human skulls, had been placed. Its lintel was carved with the heads of four horses, and additional decoration in paint. At the top of the lintel was a limestone statue of a bird of 60&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm which has been called a goose, but is now thought more likely to be a raptor.
# A dualfaced, androgynous sculpture of limestone (0.2 m high and 30&amp;nbsp;cm long).
# Two statues of a figure in a seated Buddha-like position (0.62 m high).

The first interpretations of archaeologists was that this was a secluded sanctuary. The latest findings, from various multidisciplinary studies, suggest that it was an agglomeration of about 0.5 hectares with a sanctuary to the north, as well as a bulwark of protection.

The site is important in part because it provides evidence for the Celtic "head cult" described in Greek and Roman accounts.

The site is near to another Celtic-Roman site at [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]], which had similar relief sculpture of severed human and horse heads, as well as skull niches carved into pillars. Also see [[Oppidum|Oppidium]] for other nearby archaeological sites of approximately the same historical period.

A '''''rotulus''''' (plural: ''rotuli'') is a kind of roll consisting of a long and narrow strip of writing material, historically [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]], that is wound around a wooden axle or rod and is written on its interior face or side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Grout |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/scroll/scrollcodex.html |title=Scroll and Codex |website=Encyclopaedia Romana}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that it is unwound vertically so that the writing runs parallel to the rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whats-on/online/crossing-borders/codex |title=What's On?: From Roll to Codex |website=Bodleian Libraries |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other kind of roll, namely the "[[scroll]]", whose writing runs perpendicular to the rod in multiple columns.

''Rotuli'' were historically used for:

The '''Scottish National Gallery''' (formerly the '''National Gallery of Scotland''') is the [[national art gallery]] of [[Scotland]]. It is located on [[The Mound]] in central [[Edinburgh]], close to [[Princes Street]]. The building was designed in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style by [[William Henry Playfair]], and first opened to the public in 1859.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The gallery houses Scotland's national collection of [[fine art]], spanning [[Scottish art|Scottish]] and international art from the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] up to the start of the 20th century. 

The Scottish National Gallery is run by [[National Galleries of Scotland]], a public body that also owns the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] and the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]. Because of its architectural similarity, the Scottish National Gallery is frequently confused by visitors with the neighbouring [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] (RSA), a separate institution which works closely with the Scottish National Gallery.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edinburgh Castle and National Gallery (3610788685).jpg|thumb|Edinburgh Castle and National Gallery (c.1865)]]
The origins of Scotland's national collection lie with the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, founded in 1819. It began to acquire paintings, and in 1828 the Royal Institution building opened on The Mound. In 1826, the Scottish Academy was founded by a group of artists as an offshoot of the Royal Institution, and in 1838 it became the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] (RSA). A key aim of the RSA was the founding of a national collection. It began to build up a collection and from 1835 rented exhibition space within the Royal Institution building.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/history-architecture-121/ |title=Scottish National Gallery - History &amp; Architecture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207031139/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/history-architecture-121/ |archive-date=7 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |access-date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, plans were put in place for a new building to house the RSA.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The noted Scottish architect William Henry Playfair was commissioned to prepare designs, and on 30 August 1850, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] laid the [[foundation stone]].&lt;ref name=listed&gt;{{Historic Scotland listed building number|27679|1 The Mound, National Gallery Of Scotland with Railings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was originally divided along the middle, with the east half housing the exhibition galleries of the RSA, and the western half containing the new National Gallery of Scotland,&lt;ref name=listed/&gt; formed from the collection of the Royal Institution.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1912 the RSA moved into the Royal Institution building, which remains known as the [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]]. When it re-opened, the gallery concentrated on building its permanent collection of Scottish and European art for the nation of Scotland.

In the early 21st century, the National Galleries launched the Playfair Project, a scheme to create a new basement entrance to the National Gallery in [[Princes Street Gardens]] and an underground connecting space, called the Weston Link, between the Gallery and the renovated Royal Scottish Academy Building building. The new underground space opened in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/aboutus/special-projects/the-playfair-project// |title=Playfair Project |publisher=National Galleries of Scotland |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the gallery's [[umbrella organisation]], National Galleries of Scotland, underwent a rebranding exercise, and National Gallery of Scotland was renamed the Scottish National Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=MatthewC|title="The Concept of the 'Master' in Art Education in Britain and Ireland, 1770 to the Present "|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351545471|page=17|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzkrDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=q0-8UuSrIr&amp;dq=%22Scottish%20National%20Gallery%22%20rebranded%20%22National%20Gallery%20of%20Scotland%22&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O Street creates unifying brands for Scottish galleries - Design Week|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/9-june-2011/o-street-creates-unifying-brands-for-scottish-galleries/|website=[[Design Week]]|accessdate=12 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412093312/https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/9-june-2011/o-street-creates-unifying-brands-for-scottish-galleries/|archivedate=12 April 2018|date=8 June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
William Playfair's building — like its neighbour, the Royal Scottish Academy — was designed in the form of an [[Ancient Greek temple]] atop a [[stylobate]] steps. While Playfair designed the RSA in the [[Doric order]], the National Gallery building was surrounded by [[Ionic column]]s topped with [[tetrastyle]] [[portico]]es. The pair of porticoes at the main entrance reflect the building's original dual purpose, to house the two collections of the NGS and the RSA, and these originally served as two separate entrances.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Donald|title=Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History|date=2003|publisher=Signal Books|isbn=9781902669731|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfaW7pkoPioC&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=national%20gallery%20of%20scotland%20edinburgh%20greek%20temple%23&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pevsner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gifford|first1=John|last2=McWilliam|first2=Colin|last3=Walker|first3=David|last4=Wilson|first4=Christopher|title=Edinburgh|date=1991|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300096720|pages=282-3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mvmDV3oeRU0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=edinburgh%20pevsner&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=listed /&gt;

Playfair worked to a much more limited budget than the RSA project, and this is reflected in his comparatively austere architectural style. He may have drawn inspiration from an 1829 scheme for an arcade of shops by Archibald Elliot II, son of [[Archibald Elliot]]. Playfair's National Gallery was laid out in a [[cruciform]] plan; he originally planned to build towers at the corners of the transverse central block, but these were abandoned during the project. When the RSA moved into the former Royal Institution building in 1912, the English architect [[William Thomas Oldrieve]] was engaged to remodel the NGS interior to house the National Gallery collection exclusively.&lt;ref name="pevsner"/&gt;

In the 1970s, when the gallery was under the direction of the [[Department of the Environment (United Kingdom)|Department of the Environment]], the building was extended. An upper floor was added at the south end in 1972, creating five new small galleries, and in 1978 a new gallery was opened in the basement to house the Gallery's Scottish Collection.&lt;ref name="pevsner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="our-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our history|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/about-us/our-history|website=www.nationalgalleries.org|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland|accessdate=12 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412103722/https://www.nationalgalleries.org/about-us/our-history|archivedate=12 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Princes Street Gardens entrance and underground space opened in 2004 was designed by John Miller and Partners. Construction took five years and cost £32 million. The area contains a lecture theatre, education area, shop, restaurant, an interactive gallery, and a link to the RSA building.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3533074.stm |title=Opening day for gallery project |publisher=BBC News |date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The research facilities at the Scottish National Gallery include the Prints and Drawings Collection of over 30,000 works on paper, from the [[early Renaissance]] to the late nineteenth century; and the reference-only Research Library. The Research Library covers the period from 1300 to 1900 and holds approximately 50,000 volumes of books, journals, slides, and microfiches, as well as some archival material relating to the collections, exhibitions and history of the National Gallery. The Print Room or Research Library can be accessed by appointment.

==Collection==
{{commons and category|Scottish National Gallery|Paintings in the Scottish National Gallery}}
At the heart of the National Gallery's collection is a group of paintings transferred from the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] Building. This includes masterpieces by [[Jacopo Bassano]], [[Van Dyck]] and [[Giambattista Tiepolo]]. The National Gallery did not receive its own purchase grant until 1903.

In the Gallery's main ground floor rooms are displayed a number of major large-scale canvases such as [[Benjamin West]]'s ''Alexander III of Scotland Rescued from the Fury of a Stag'' (1786), [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s ''The Feast of Herod'' (1633 or c.1637-38) and a pair of paintings by [[Titian]], ''Diana and Actaeon'' and ''Diana and Callisto'' (purchased jointly with the [[National Gallery, London]]). The Scottish National Gallery has also jointly acquired one of [[Antonio Canova|Canova]]'s  sculptures of [[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]  with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref name="artworks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artworks|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/search?location%5B36063%5D=36063|website=www.nationalgalleries.org|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish National Gallery has a notable collection of works by [[Scottish art|Scottish artists]], including several landscapes by [[Alexander Nasmyth]], and several works by Sir [[Henry Raeburn]] — of particular note his portraits of [[Alexander Ranaldson Macdonell]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]]), and his celebrated painting, ''[[The Skating Minister]]''. There are also a number of works by artists of the [[Glasgow School]] such as [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]]. The Gallery also holds a collection of works by English painters, such as [[John Constable|Constable]]'s ''[[Dedham Vale (painting)|Dedham Vale]]'' and a sizeable collection of water colours by [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]] which are traditionally displayed in January. ''[[The Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', a painting considered to be iconic of Scottish culture, is also held in the gallery, the work of the English painter [[Edwin Landseer|Landseer]].&lt;ref name="artworks" /&gt;

'''Sha-Amun-en-su''' ({{lang-egy|the fertile fields of Amun}}) was an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] priestess and singer who lived in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] during the first half of the [[8th century BC|8th century B.C.]], responsible for ceremonial duties at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]], dedicated to the god [[Amun]]. Sha-Amun-en-su was a ''Heset'', i.e., a member of the foremost group of singers with ritualistic functions active in the temple of Amun. After her death, which is estimated to have occurred around the age of 50, the singer was [[Mummy|mummified]] and placed in a [[sarcophagus]] made of [[stucco]] and [[polychrome]] wood. Since its sealing, more than 2700 years ago, Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus had never been opened, throughout its history, conserving inside the singer's mummy, a feature that gave it extreme rarity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/2014/01/13/o-ultimo-ato-da-favorita-imperador/|title=O último ato da favorita do imperador : Revista Pesquisa Fapesp|website=revistapesquisa.fapesp.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus and its mummy were given as presents to the Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]] during his second travel to Egypt, in 1876, by the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]]. They became featured items displayed in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista|Palace of São Cristóvão]], integrating Pedro II's private collection until the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]], in 1889, when they became part of the  Egyptian collection of the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. However, a [[National Museum of Brazil fire|large-scale fire in the museum]] on 2 September 2018, destroyed the sarcophagus and the mummy, as well as almost all archaeological artifacts in permanent display.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-45391771|title=O que havia no acervo do Museu Nacional e foi consumido pelo fogo|date=2018-09-02|work=BBC News Brasil|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Sha-Amun-en-su_(hieróglifos).jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Hieroglyphic inscription of Sha-Amun-en-su name and title on the sarcophagus]]
Sha-Amun-en-su was born circa the year 800 B.C., during the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]]. Her name and almost all known information about her life come from the [[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphic inscriptions]] in her sarcophagus It is known that she was a "singer of Amun's sanctuary", that means, a singer with priestly assignments in the service of the Temple of Karnak  in the ancient city of Thebes (currently [[Luxor]]), devoted to the god [[Amun]]. Thebes was one of the most important religious centers in Ancient Egypt, congregating a complex of temples and hundreds of workers, among them priests, scribes, singers, musicians, managers and employees, with Karnak as its main temple.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brancaglion|first=Antonio|title=Sha-Amun-em-su Uma Cantora do Egito Antigo|url=http://www.academia.edu/36231588/Sha-Amun-em-su_Uma_Cantora_do_Egito_Antigo|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bakos, 1994, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several categories of priestly singers at Amun's shrine. Sha-Amun-en-su belonged to the main group, called ''Heset'', women who exercised ritualistic functions and sang hymns in honor of the god Amun at sacred ceremonies and festivals, either as soloists or accompanied by female choirs. The  ''Heset'' tradition lasted in Thebes between the 9th to 6th centuries  B.C. Besides  singing the religious hymnns, they were responsible in hepling the "God's Wife of Amun" during the temple rites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Esquife_da_dama_Sha-amun-en-su_04.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px| Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus]]
The ''Heset'' were not obliged to live permanently in the temple and many of them attended only for the execution of the ceremonies. Nevertheless, they obeyed to strict codes of conduct. Preferently, they had to stay [[Chastity|chaste]], but, even though not being virgins, they were considered extremely pure, to such extent as performing their gifts in such an important and symbolic edification as the temple of  Amun. Although they were not members of the Egyptian nobility, the singers were chosen among members of local elites and prepared for the function from an early age, being "adopted" by an older singer who served as their tutor and, in fact, as an "adoptive mother".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There are no information about Sha-Amun-en-su's biilogical family or foster mother. It is likely that, like most Heset, she came from a wealthy family  traditionally linked to priestly activities. It is known, however, that sge had an "adopted daughter," based on the inscriptions of another sarcophagus currently preserved in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo — the casket of a singer called Merset-Amun, whose hieroglyphs report that she was "''daughter of Sha-Amun-en-su, singer of the shrine of Amun".'' Sha-Amun-en-su lived until around 50 years old, according to researches led by the National Museum's Laboratory of Egyptology. The death causes could not be determined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Mummy ==
After the singer's death, her body was mummified by Egyptian priests and placed into a sarcophagus. Sha-Amun-en-su's coffin cover has never been removed, preventing the mummy from being studied by the naked eye. Thus, all analyzes of the coffin's inner structure and mummy status depended on X-ray examinations, computerized tomography, and three-dimensional scans. The set consisting of the sarcophagus and its mummy possessed great historical and scientific value, especially in relation to the knowledge of the funerary practices and rituals of the Temple of Ámon, since mummies of Egyptian singers are rare and even rarer are mummies of singers deposited in sealed coffins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some features of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummification process were also quite specific and accentuated its rarity. Although most of the mummification process has followed traditional procedures, such as evisceration of the body and its wrapping with linen bandages, research coordinated by archaeologist {{ill|Antonio Brancaglion Junior|pt}}, curator of the Egyptian collection of the National Museum, revealed that the mummy's throat was covered with resin-coated bandages. This particularity indicates a concern of the mummifying priests to protect a zone seen as "vital" for a singer with ritualistic functions that, according to the Egyptian beliefs, would continue using her gift in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/serafina/2015/11/1697689-essa-e-a-mistura-do-brasil-com-o-egito-mumia-passeia-por-shopping-na-barra.shtml|title=Essa é a mistura do Brasil com o Egito: múmia passeia por shopping na Barra - 25/10/2015 - Serafina - Folha de S.Paulo|website=www1.folha.uol.com.br|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Oriental Studies at the [[University of Chicago]] preserves in its collection another mummy, also in a sealed sarcophagus, called [[Meresamun]] ("Amun's beloved", in Egyptian language). Like Sha-Amun-en-su, she was also a singer of the Amun temple during the 22nd Dynasty and her mummy also boasts a kind of protection in her throat. Meresamun was about 30 years old at her death. Her mouth and throat are lined with a padded protection, apparently made with pressed earth and bandages. Based on these common characteristics between the two mummies, Brancaglion hypothesized that there were specific standards of mummification for the women in charge of chanting hymns and songs in the Temple of Karnak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Anatomical analysis of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummy failed to determine the cause of her death. It is known, anyway, that the singer was around 50 years old when she died. The mummy's body appeared to be in good condition, with no traumas or injuries. The examinations also allowed to observe a very rare dental curiosity: the mummy still kept almost all her teeth, missing only one. The Sha-Amun-en-su mummy also underwent a three-dimensional laser scan coordinated by Jorge Lopes, from the Tri-dimensional Experimentation Nucleus of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]]. That procedure allowed the generation of three-dimensional data files (called "orthogonal coordinates") that served as the basis for making a small-scale replica of the singer's skeleton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funerary artifacts ==
Computed tomography analysis, coordinated by radiologist Iugiro Kuroki, under the supervision of paleopathologist Sheila Mendonça of [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation|Fiocruz]], identified several amulets with votive functions stored inside the coffin, including a heart-scarab, an artifact related to Egyptian belief in the resurrection of the dead. Sha-Amun-en-su's heart-scarab consisted of a green stone of oval shape, set in a gold plaque and attached to a golden cord, with the name of the singer written in hieroglyphs. These artifacts were often placed on the heart of the mummy and had the function of "replacing" it in cases in which the organ was extracted during the evisceration process. In this way the priests sought to preserve the "integrity" of the deceased in the afterlife, as well as the functions, states, characteristics, and other attributes that ancient Egyptians attached to the heart, such as intelligence and feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Sarcophagus ==
[[File:Caixão_de_Sha-Amun-En-Su.jpg|right|thumb|240x240px|Profile face detail on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-in-su.]]
The Sha-Amun-en-su sarcophagus was composed of box and lid, both carved in polychrome stuccoed wood.It was 1,58 meters high and was made around 750 BC. Throughout its nearly three millennia of history, since it had been sealed with the mummified body of the singer and her votive amulets, the sarcophagus had never been opened.It was a highly representative example of Egyptian funerary art from the 8th and 9th centuries BC, characterized by the profusion of references to [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolitan]] theology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The top of the sarcophagus cover was decorated with a female face, which sought to represent the natural color of the skin, topped with a blue headdress, decorated with yellow vulture wings and yellow and red ribbons. Shades of dark green, red and yellow stood out against a white background. At the breast height, there was the figure of the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and a representation of a ram-headed bird with wings outstretched over the lid, symbolizing protection. The bird's claws and tail were flanked by two [[uraeus]] serpents, one with the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and one with the crown of [[Lower Egypt]] The four [[Sons of Horus]] were represented in two pairs, one pair in front of each snake.On the right side were [[Imset]] with a human head and [[Hapy]] with a baboon's head, and on the left side [[Duamutef]] with a jackal's head and [[Qebehsenuf]] with a hawk's head. In the region of the legs were represented the amulets of the god [[Osiris]], flanked by divinities. The two halves of the sarcophagus were separated by the sign [[Ankh]], the symbol of life, which was repeated in two other ribbons. Finally, there was a representation of the singer's [[Ba (soul)|Ba]] - Ba was understood at the same time as a spiritual component of human beings, gods and animals, as a metaphysical principle related to the individuality of being and as a dynamic element that separates from the body after death, approaching, in this sense, the Western concept of soul.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the back and outside of the sarcophagus was a representation of the great [[Djed]] pillar, a sign of stability associated with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, who ruled the underworld and the dead. In different parts of the coffin, there were bands with hieroglyphic inscriptions, analyzed and studied by different Egyptologists, such as [[Kenneth Kitchen]] and Alberto Childe. Kitchen was the first to identify the mummy, deciphering two bands of distinct hieroglyphs that associated her name to her occupation. The first band bore the inscription'' "An offering that the king makes [to] Osiris, Chief of the West, great God, Lord of Abydos - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine [of Ammon], Sha-Amun-en-su "''. In the second line of hieroglyphs was read: "''An offering that the king makes [to] Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, Lord of the [shrine] Shetayet - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine of Ammon, Sha-Amun-en-su"''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:D._Pedro_II_e_sua_comitiva_visitando_as_pirâmides_em_1876.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Emperor Pedro II and  his entourage visiting the Egyptian pyramids, in 1876.]]
There is scarce information on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su in the pre-nineteenth century period. There is no record of the date or exact archaeological site where the coffin was found (although it is known to come from the vast western Thebes complex), nor is there any information on the process of integrating the coffin into the [[Egyptian Khedivate]] collections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1876, during the second visit of Emperor Dom Pedro II to Egypt, the sarcophagus was offered as a gift to the Brazilian monarch by Ismail Pasha. In return, Pedro II offered a book to the Khedive. An amateur Egyptologist and enthusiast of Egyptian culture, Pedro II had a special affection for the sarcophagus, which soon became one of the most relevant pieces of his private collection. The emperor kept him standing in his study in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista|Palace of São Cristóvão]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During its passage through the collection of Pedro II, the sarcophagus was damaged in the event of a storm. Knocked down by the wind, the sarcophagus fell, crashing into one of the emperor's office windows and having its left side fragmented. It was later restored, but the intervention would remain visible ever since. Other restorations would be carried out in the following decades aiming at eliminating, above all, the threats of termites and wasps, attracted by the oldness of the wood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The sarcophagus remained in the Palace of São Cristóvão after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, and was later integrated into the collection of Egyptian archeology of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. Since its integration into the museum collection, the sarcophagus has always been one of the most outstanding pieces of the collection, having served as the basis for a large number of scientific researches, theses and monographs, developed by researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and others Brazilian scientific institutions and academics from different parts of the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, commenting on the importance and uniqueness of the sarcophagus and the mummy of Sha-Amun-en-su, the curator of the Egyptian National Museum's collection, Antonio Brancaglion Junior, stated:
{{cquote|If you have a mummy, you have a mummy, if you have not, you won't get one anymore. If we lose it, we will never get anything else remotely similar. We have to keep it to the end.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;}}
On September 2, 2018, a major fire destroyed the building of the National Museum and much of the collection on display, including the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su, with its mummy and all the votive artifacts conserved within it. In the fire, the other mummies and sarcophagi of the collection, along with most of the archaeological collection, were also lost. The fire caused great commotion in the academic, scientific and cultural circles of Brazil and the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Shropshire Music Foundation''' is a not-for-profit organization which aims to improve the lives of children in war-torn countries through participation in music.  Their mission is to "redress psychosocial trauma, advance emotional health, develop scholastic achievement, foster ethnic tolerance, promote peace, and improve the quality of life for war-affected children and adolescents through the establishment of on-going music education and performance programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shropshire Foundation Website |publisher=Shropshire Foundation |url=http://www.shropshirefoundation.org |access-date=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded by Liz Shropshire in 1999, the Shropshire Foundation currently has programs in three countries.  The [[Kosovo]] branch is helping children recover from the trauma of the [[ethnic cleansing]] that Serbian forces undertook in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-03-13/features/0603130116_1_kind-of-music-program-war-zones-instruments |title='Kosovo's Pied Piper' gives kids in war zones music |publisher=Chicago Tribune |access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commongroundradio.org/shows/02/0252.shtml |title=Kosovo's Pied Piper: The Liz Shropshire Story |publisher=Common Ground Radio |access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMF is helping children in [[Northern Ireland]], where segregation of Protestants and Catholics has torn apart communities.  In [[Uganda]], the SMF is helping children who have been victims of [[Military use of children|child soldiery]]. In [[Greece]], SMF has been teaching music classes in refugee camps since Fall 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/music/about-us/news/teaching-peace-through-music-liz-shropshire-speak-cu-nov-14 |title=Teaching peace through music: Liz Shropshire to speak at CU Nov. 14 |publisher=College of Music, [[University of Colorado]], [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] |access-date=4 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203909/http://www.colorado.edu/music/about-us/news/teaching-peace-through-music-liz-shropshire-speak-cu-nov-14 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shropshire Music Foundation has an all-volunteer staff, and in many communities, the program is run by young adults who were so greatly influenced by Ms. Shropshire's foundation that they have committed to furthering the program.  Groups have sprung up all over the world to benefit the Shropshire Music Foundation (which is run entirely off donations).  Private contributors, music companies, and schools of music, such as the [[Eastman School of Music]], are working to keep the foundation alive, as it has become financially threatened in recent years.

'''''Sobor on the Blood''''' (''Unity on Blood'') is a Ukrainian [[documentary film]] of 2006. Joint project of Ukrainian TV channel [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]] and Studio [[Teleсon]].

In December, 1991 [[Ukraine]] became an independent state. However the young state, which has been held down with economical difficulties and political fights, could not give sufficient attention to learning its own history. The majority of usual citizens of Ukraine even today know almost nothing about greatness and tragedy of the Ukrainian national-liberation movement, and so any discussion about this theme remains at a level of stereotypes of the Soviet epoch.

The series "Sobor on the Blood" for the first time comprehensively and fairly will tell viewer about the struggle for unity and independence of our country for the period from 1919 to 1949. This struggle is considered in the series as a part of the all-European history. In fact [[Yevhen Konovalets]] and [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], [[Stepan Bandera]] and [[Andrey Sheptytsky]], [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]] and [[Roman Shukhevych]] lived and acted in a difficult situation of the grandiose geo-political conflict between Hitlerite [[Reich]], [[Joseph Stalin]] Empire and the western democracies. Such approach allows understanding and comprehending the reasons of events and acts in common to all mankind sense, but not from one or another with stereotypes flushed point of view.

The '''Society of Animal Artists''' is an international organization for [[artist]]s who paint, sculpt, or draw animals and wildlife, founded in 1960.

The Society of Animal Artists, Inc. (SAA) is "devoted to promoting excellence in the portrayal of the creatures sharing our planet, and to the education of the public through its informative [[art]] seminars, lectures and teaching demonstrations. Some of the finest animal artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Japan, and Australia are represented in the Society's membership." &lt;ref name="object of society"&gt;[http://www.societyofanimalartists.com/info.html Society of Animal Artists Official Website: Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society holds an annual exhibition, "Art &amp; the Animal", which premieres at museum venues. &lt;ref name="society exhibition"&gt;[http://uknow.uky.edu/content/art-and-animal-captures-uk-art-museum-spotlight Article: 'Art and the Animal' Captures UK Art Museum Spotlight]&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the exhibition is shown on tour around the United States.  [http://www.davidjwagnerllc.com/ Dr. David J. Wagner] is the current Tour Director and Curator for the Society of Animal Artists.  The Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 with their exhibition at the San Diego Natural History Museum in San Diego, CA. A complete history of the SAA's exhibition can be found on their website.

The Society of Animal Artists is recognized as a 501(c)3 charitable organization by the I.R.S. and all contributions to the Society are tax-deductible''

==Introduction==
The Society of Animal Artists is an organization of artists who produce the best animal art in the world. The mission of the Society of Animal Artists is to promote excellence in the portrayal of domesticated and wild animals in art. The upshot of this nexus of talent and mission, is that artworks created by members of the Society of Animal Artists have established new standards of excellence in fine art, and that the Annual Exhibition of the Society of Animal Artists and its traveling exhibition, Art and the Animal, have become the standard by which all others are measured. The Society of Animal Artists has an historical affinity with organizations that grew out of a movement to form associations and clubs dedicated to art in the 19th century. Like the National Academy of Design and other such organizations, the Society of Animal Artists is mandated by its bylaws to organize annual exhibitions to ensure new, strong and fresh artwork and afford its members with ample display opportunities. It is also worth noting that the Society of Animal Artists was founded in response to an exhibition entitled Animals in the Bronx Zoo, held at Burr Galleries in New York, because this established an historical affinity with the conservation movement, which various members have supported ever since, not only through the ecological message of their artwork but also through generous contributions and sales.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
In the 1950s, individuals from the New York metropolitan area who liked to meet and paint at the Bronx Zoo &lt;ref&gt;Bronx Zoo https://bronxzoo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; together staged "Animals in the Bronx Zoo" at the Burr Gallery sponsored by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;New York Zoological Society https://www.wcs.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Allen Bott and Guido Borghi were inspired to form the organization after an enthusiastic reception to this exhibition. The fledgling Society soon became a member of the renowned [[Salmagundi Club]], and established an office in their building at 47 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. Early Exhibitions were held in various galleries such as Sportsman’s Edge, Grand Central Art Galleries and the Alder Gallery (All in New York City). 
In addition to Bott and Borghi, early members included: Elizabeth Rungius Felda [Sister of Carl Rungius], Paul Bransom, John Clymer, Gifford Cochran, Brenda Frey, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Gertude K. Lathrop, Robert Lougheed, Ugo Mochi, Clement Weisbecker and Walter Wilwerding.

===Catalogs and exhibitions===
The first SAA catalog, produced in 1978 for the exhibition at Sportsman’s Edge Gallery, consisted of 8 pages and was black and white. In 1979, the SAA had its first actual Annual Exhibition opening (again at Sportsman’s Edge), with formal programs and events. A 20 page black and white catalog was produced. In 1980, the "Society of Animal Artists Exhibition/Convention" was hosted by Game Conservation International at the Four Seasons Plaza Nacional Hotel, San Antonio, TX. A 28 page, black and white catalog was produced. The first four-color catalog (44 pages) was produced in 1990, for the 30th Annual Exhibition at St. Hubert’s Giralda, NJ.

The SAA has hosted annual exhibitions since 1960 with the exhibition first being named "Art and the Animal" in 1988. The first museum venue was the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia in 1981. In 1988 the Society recruited David J. Wagner to create and manage tours of artworks selected from annual exhibitions and to secure hosts for its annual exhibitions. SAA exhibitions have been displayed throughout the United States, with approximately 70% of hosting venues having been art museums or general museums that have included art as an integral dimension of their core mission. Over the years, the SAA’s work has been on display at more than 100 different institutions across the United States—and once in Canada in 1995 at the Old Algonquin Museum, Algonquin Park, Ontario.

==Synopsis==
This coming of age story of courage and inspiring perseverance opens in 1960s [[Vienna]], where [[Shlomo Carlebach]] is giving a concert, having returned to the city for the first time in decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi With a Beat and Tie-Dyed Prayers |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Charles Isherwood |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-a-musical-about-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then transitions back in time to Nazi-occupied [[Austria]] when Shlomo, as a child, witnessed the murder of a Jewish man singing in the streets. This experience causes Shlomo to make a pledge to always stand up for freedom of expression through music. To escape persecution, the Carlebach family moves to the [[Upper West Side]] in New York City where Shlomo is a [[Yeshiva]] student studying the [[Talmud]] and memorizing the [[Torah]], following his father's footsteps to become a [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor: Shalom, Love, and Understanding |publisher=The Village Voice |date= August 21, 2013 |author=Tom Sellar |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-08-21/theater/soul-doctor/full/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shlomo's path soon changes when he meets the legendary jazz singer [[Nina Simone]] in a [[Greenwich Village]] night club. She not only teaches him about her [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[jazz]] musical roots, but also confesses how her people, like Jews in Europe at the time, were being persecuted in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Love, Prayer, LSD and Nina Simone: Get to Know Soul Doctor’s Rock Star Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach  |publisher=Broadway.com |date=July 31, 2013 |author=Josh Ferri |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/170898/love-prayer-lsd-and-nina-simone-get-to-know-soul-doctors-rock-star-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the music of Simone, Shlomo begins to break [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] tradition by obtaining a guitar. He is soon writing songs and playing his music for women and non-Jews in clubs around [[New York City]]. Shlomo embraces [[pop music]] and [[hippiedom]] over established scholasticism despite ramifications within his family. In the late '60s he moved to [[Haight-Ashbury]] in [[San Francisco]] where a "[[House of Love and Prayer]]" becomes his home with a following that keeps growing. During this period he played concerts alongside acts such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Grateful Dead|the Grateful Dead]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Keith Staskiewicz |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20364394_20726248,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Nina Simone end the show back in Vienna, performing a concert in memory of the Jewish singer he saw gunned down in the street by [[Nazism|Nazis]].

Shlomo's inspired life was driven by his talent, heart and optimism. His [[inspirational message]] is clearly heard through his own songs throughout Soul Doctor, an uplifting musical for people of all ages, religions and backgrounds. His personal pledge to stand up for [[freedom of expression]] through the power of music soars with the spirit instilled in him from lessons learned throughout his unique and interesting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Broadway Review: ‘Soul Doctor’ |publisher=Variety |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Marilyn Stasio |url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/reviews/broadway-review-soul-doctor-1200579212/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The Soul Doctor musical was reviewed by many publications following its openings in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php/ Official Press Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224062348/http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php |date=2013-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Siegel in Theatre Mania wrote in her review: "The story is going to be compared to ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', but the engaging and often moving new musical has a good deal more thematic depth that its predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Siegel | first=Barbara | url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/08-2012/soul-doctor_60461.html | title=Soul Doctor, review | publisher=Theater Mania | date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Klug's review in Jewlicious.com concluded: "With plenty of good Jewish perspectives on the comedy of life, it had me laughing, singing and clapping ... it's so good ...

[[Frank Scheck]], in ''[[The New York Post]]'', praised [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Eric Anderson]]'s performance, writing: "Eric Anderson beautifully suggests Carlebach's soft-spoken, gentle appeal, as well as the charisma that jolted him to stardom. Erica Ash is equally superb as Simone, whether quietly conveying the singer's fierce dignity or delivering stunning versions of signature classics such as "[[Sinnerman]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Scheck | first=Frank | url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/rocking_tale_of_star_sung_in_shlomo_VuZTYpHuLXm5N2LzepDsuK | title=SA rocking tale of '60s star sung in Shlomo | publisher=[[The New York Post]] | date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason Zinoman also praised Anderson's performance in ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing: "Transforming from a mild-mannered rabbi into a kinetic dynamo, [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Anderson]] imbues his numbers with their own arc, often starting in a meditative mood before slowly building to a joyous, leaping roar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Zinoman | first= Jason | url= http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-shlomo-carlebach-new-york-theater-workshop.html | title=T''Religious Roots Tangle With the Groovy '60s'' | publisher= [[The New York Times]] | date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for [[science fiction]] writers. Since its origin in 1985, it has been held in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]]; Bryn Mawr, [[Pennsylvania]]; and most recently in Little Switzerland, North Carolina.

Currently organized by Richard Butner, Sycamore Hill was started by [[John Kessel]] and [[Mark L. Van Name]]. It is an invitation-only workshop for established SF, fantasy, and slipstream writers. Attendees have included [[Kelly Link]], [[Carol Emshwiller]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Connie Willis]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Robert Frazier (writer)|Robert Frazier]], [[Ted Chiang]], [[Benjamin Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000278.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], among many others.

A collection of original stories from the 1994 workshop was published as the anthology ''Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology'', edited by John Kessel, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner ([[Tor Books]], 1996). It includes works by Richard Butner, Carol Emshwiller, Karen Joy Fowler, Robert Frazier, Gregory Frost, Alexander Jablokov, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Jonathan Lethem, Maureen F. McHugh, Michaela Roessner, Bruce Sterling, and Mark L. Van Name.

[[Orson Scott Card]] wrote about his experience at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop in the essay "On Sycamore Hill." Scholars such as Michael Collins identify Card's Sycamore Hill experience as marking a critical "turning point" in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward Other Worlds: Perspectives on John Milton, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">'''Symphony No. 3''', Op. 75  (1955) is [[Ernst Toch]]'s (1887—1964) third of seven [[symphony|symphonies]]. He was awarded the 1956 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] for the piece.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1956 1956]", ''Pulitzer.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Premiered December 2, 1955 by the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[William Steinberg]], it was commissioned by the [[American Jewish Tercentenary Committee]] of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Heinz Dietrich (2010). ''The Pulitzer Prize Winners for Music'', p.61. {{ISBN|9783631596081}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;Elizabeth A. Brennan, Elizabeth C. Clarage (1999). ''Who's Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners'', p.427. {{ISBN|9781573561112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestration includes a "hisser", a [[carbon dioxide]] [[storage tank|tank]] that makes a hissing noise, whose use is optional.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt; His first three symphonies were inspired by his need to flee Nazi Germany and move to America.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

Selecting the piece the jury wrote: "one of his finest works, of sure craftsmanship, contemporary in feeling, without self-conscious striving for the new and the original, beautiful and brilliant in orchestral sound."&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-D Fischer, Erika J. Fischer (2003). ''Complete Historical Handbook of the Pulitzer Prize System 1917-2000'', p.265. {{ISBN|9783110939125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Raft of the Medusa''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Radeau de la Méduse}} {{IPA-fr|lə ʁado d(ə) la medyz|}}) is an [[oil painting]] of 1818–19 by the French [[Romantic movement|Romantic]] painter and [[lithography|lithographer]] [[Théodore Géricault]] (1791–1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491&amp;nbsp;cm × 716&amp;nbsp;cm (16' 1" × 23' 6"),&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Klaus. ''Géricault and His Work''. Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1955. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval [[French frigate Méduse (1810)|frigate ''Méduse'']], which ran aground off the coast of today's [[Mauritania]] on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13&amp;nbsp;days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practised cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.

Géricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest.&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;"[https://archive.is/20121209133033/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226914&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&amp;bmLocale=en The Raft of the Medusa]". [[Louvre]]. Retrieved on 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting.

Although ''The Raft of the Medusa'' retains elements of the traditions of [[history painting]], in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The [[Louvre]] acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], and [[Édouard Manet]].

== Background ==
{{main article|French frigate Méduse (1810)}}

[[File:Raft of Méduse-Alexandre Corréard-IMG 4788-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|Plan of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' at the moment of its crew's rescue&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo. ''Extremities: Painting Empire in Post-Revolutionary France''. [[Yale University Press]], 2002. 177. {{ISBN|0-300-08887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In June 1816, the French [[frigate]] ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' departed from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], bound for the [[Senegal]]ese port of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the [[Combat stores ship|storeship]] ''Loire'', the [[brig]] [[HMS Plumper (1804)|''Argus'']] and the [[corvette]] ''Écho''. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed [[Ranks in the French Navy|captain]] of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Zarzeczny, Matthew. "Theodore Géricault's 'The Raft of the Méduse' Part I". ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'', Fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zarzeczny, Matthew. "Theodore Géricault's 'The Raft of the Méduse' Part II". ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'', Spring 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;For Louis XVIII's real political actions and appointments, see P. Mansel, ''Louis XVIII'' (London, 1981), and for the general political climate of the period, see Munro Price, ''The Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions'' (London, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Peace of Paris]]. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel [[Julien-Désiré Schmaltz]], and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Jore, Léonce (1953) "[http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0399-1385_1953_num_40_139_1188 La vie diverse et volontaire du colonel Julien, Désiré Schmaltz]". ''Revue d'histoire des colonies''. Vol. 40, No. 139, pp. 265–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to make good time, the ''Méduse'' overtook the other ships, but due to poor navigation it drifted {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} off course. On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today's [[Mauritania]]. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumereys, a returned [[émigré]] who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment.&lt;ref name="Darcy"&gt;Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.

Although the ''Méduse'' was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship's complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Lavauzelle|page=30|title=Les Troupes de Marine 1622-1984|ISBN=2-7025-0142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; - at least 146 men and one woman - were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded ''Méduse''. The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose.&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 2:19&lt;/ref&gt; For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship's biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny &amp; Corréard, 59–60, 76, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors "to the frontiers of human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest."&lt;ref name="Darcy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Jonathan. "[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article1543209.ece Death and the masterpiece]". ''[[The Times]]'', 24 March 2007. Retrieved on 20 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After 13 days, on 17 July 1816, the raft was rescued by the ''Argus'' by chance—no particular search effort was made by the French for the raft.&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 2:38&lt;/ref&gt; By this time only 15 men were still alive; the others had been killed or thrown overboard by their comrades, died of starvation, or thrown themselves into the sea in despair.&lt;ref&gt;Four or five of the survivors died later aboard the ''Argus''.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became a huge public embarrassment for the French monarchy, only recently restored to power after [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[Hundred Days|defeat in 1815]].&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;Brandt, Anthony. "Swept Away: When Gericault Painted the Raft of the Medusa, He Immersed Himself in His Subject's Horrors". ''American Scholar'', Autumn 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other boats became separated and though most eventually arrived at St Louis Island in Senegal, some put ashore further along the coast and lost some of their party to heat and starvation. Of the 17 men that remained behind on the ''Méduse'' only 3 were still alive when rescued by the British 42 days later.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''The Raft of the Medusa'' portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when "the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete".&lt;ref name="Christine" /&gt; The painting is on a monumental scale of 491 × 716&amp;nbsp;cm (193.3 × 282.3&amp;nbsp;in), so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized&lt;ref name="Boime142"&gt;Boime, 142&lt;/ref&gt; and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.&lt;ref name=banham/&gt;

[[File:Théodore Géricault "The raft of the Medusa".jpg|thumb|Detail from the lower left corner of the canvas showing two dying figures]]

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,&lt;ref&gt;Hagen &amp; Hagen, 378&lt;/ref&gt; stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Muther, 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.

[[File:Radeau meduse structure.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the outline of the two pyramidal structures that form the basis of the work. The position of the ''Argus'' is indicated by the yellow dot.]]
The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.&lt;ref name="Boime142" /&gt; According to the art historian Justin Wintle, "a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex."&lt;ref name="Wintle246"&gt;Wintle, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the ''Argus'', the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt;

Géricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds.&lt;ref name="Wilkin" /&gt; Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"&gt;Miles, 180&lt;/ref&gt; The work's lighting has been described as "[[Caravaggio|Caravaggesque]]",&lt;ref name="Nov85" /&gt; after the Italian artist closely associated with [[tenebrism]]—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures.&lt;ref name="M226"&gt;Muther, 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.&lt;ref name="M226"/&gt;

== Execution ==

=== Research and preparatory studies ===

[[File:Medusa study 1.jpg|thumb|Géricault's ''Study for "The Raft of the Medusa"'', pen and brown ink, 17.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 24.5&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Musee des Beaux-Arts]], [[Lille]], France]]
Géricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter.&lt;ref name="M169"&gt;Miles, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and [[Alexandre Corréard]], an engineer from the [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers]]. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting.&lt;ref name="Christine"&gt;Riding (February 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 11:38&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier travels had exposed Géricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the ''Méduse'' his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the [[Rigor mortis|stiffness]] of corpses.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt; To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead,&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt; he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon,&lt;ref name="M169" /&gt; studied the faces of dying hospital patients,&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay,&lt;ref name="M169"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[:File:Anatomical Pieces.JPG|Anatomical Pieces]]'', an unusual still-life which Géricault produced in 1818–1819, shows some of these dismembered limbs.&lt;/ref&gt; and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

[[File:Medusa Study 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Cannibalism on the Raft of the Medusa'', crayon, ink wash, and gouache on paper, 28&amp;nbsp;cm × 38&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Louvre]]. This study is darker than the final work, and the positions of the figures differ significantly from those of the later painting.]]

He worked with Corréard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to [[Le Havre]] to study the sea and sky.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 9:04&lt;/ref&gt;

He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work.&lt;ref name="Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376"&gt;Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.

Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue.&lt;ref name="R77"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship ''Argus''—visible in the upper right of the painting—which they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, "From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief."&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;

[[File:Meduse-Gericault-IMG 4808-cropped.JPG|thumb|Sailors of the ''Méduse'' detained by the British after the sinking. [[Lithograph]] by C. Motte, after Théodore Géricault]]
To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew's abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;—the ''Argus'' reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, Lorenz. ''19th Century European Painting: David to Cézanne'', 191–192, Westview Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8133-6570-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Rupert Christiansen]] points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

=== Final work ===
Géricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

[[File:Théodore Géricault - Le Radeau de la Méduse esquisse (salon de 1819).jpg|thumb|left|''Study'' c. 1818–1819, 38&amp;nbsp;cm × 46&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Louvre]]. This preparatory oil sketch nearly fully realises the positions of the figures in the final work.]]

He used friends as models, most notably the painter [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast;&lt;ref name="Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376"/&gt; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, "Géricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room."&lt;ref name="Wellingtonxi"&gt;Wellington, xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Géricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of [[vermilion]], white, [[naples yellow]], two different [[red ochre|yellow ochres]], two [[red ochre]]s, [[sienna|raw sienna]], [[light red]], [[burnt sienna]], [[crimson lake]], [[Prussian blue]], [[peach black]], [[Bone char|ivory black]], cassel earth and [[bitumen]].&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated.&lt;ref name=gayford/&gt; As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.&lt;ref name=banham&gt;Banham, Joanna. "[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=375817 "Shipwreck!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316034608/http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=375817 |date=16 March 2009 }}".

[[File:Couleurs radeau meduse.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the main 16 colours used for the painting.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;]]

Géricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a "shocking physicality"&lt;ref name="Wintle246" /&gt; and a sense of deliberate theatricality—which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30&amp;nbsp;years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:

:[Géricault's method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months;&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"/&gt; the project as a whole took 18 months.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

[[File:LastjudgementCharon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michelangelo]]. Detail of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Géricault said, "Michelangelo sent shivers up my spine, these lost souls destroying each other inevitably conjure up the tragic grandeur of the Sistine Chapel."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 10:11&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13&amp;nbsp;days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, Géricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian [[Richard Muther (art historian)|Richard Muther]], there is still a strong debt to [[Classicism]] in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid "unpictorial" costumes. Muther observes that there is "still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death".&lt;ref name="M226" /&gt;

The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant "fruitful moment"—the first awareness of the approaching ship—is described.&lt;ref name="Nov85"&gt;Novotny, 85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, David also painted an important current event with ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the [[French Revolution|revolution in France]], and it served as an important precedent for Géricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented "the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause",&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Blaney; in Noon, 49&lt;/ref&gt; but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures.&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[:File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau]]'' (1807) and ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804)&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa]]'', by Gros.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt;

The young Géricault had painted copies of work by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] (1758–1823), whose "thunderously tragic pictures" include his masterpiece, ''Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime'', where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced Géricault's painting.&lt;ref name=gayford&gt;Gayford, Martin.

The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to [[Ugolino and Dante|Ugolino]] from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of [[cannibalism]], which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli.&lt;ref name="R73"&gt;Noon, 84. Riding (June 2003), 73.

Several English and American paintings including ''[[The Death of Major Pierson]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley]] (1738–1815)—also painted within two years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like ''The Raft of the Medusa'', concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782]]'' (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and ''[[:File:SceneofaShipwreck-Copley.png|Scene of a Shipwreck]]'' (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition.&lt;ref name="R77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;Nicholson, Benedict. "The Raft of the Medusa from the Point of View of the Subject-Matter". ''Burlington Magazine'', XCVI, August 1954. 241—8&lt;/ref&gt; A further important precedent for the political component was the works of [[Francisco Goya]], particularly his ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply ''Shipwreck'' (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with ''The Raft of the Medusa''. It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

== Exhibition and reception ==

''The Raft of the Medusa'' was first shown at the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], under the title ''Scène de Naufrage'' (''Shipwreck Scene''), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers.&lt;ref name=christiansen&gt;Christiansen, Rupert.

Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? [[Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie]], a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic [[Auguste Jal]], who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its [[modernity]]. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] approved: "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt;

Géricault had deliberately sought to be both politically and artistically confrontational. Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer's sympathies favoured the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and [[Alexandre Corréard|Corréard]].&lt;ref name="Christine" /&gt; The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of Géricault's [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting's later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there.&lt;ref&gt;Riding (June 2003), 71&lt;/ref&gt; According to art critic and curator [[Karen Wilkin]], Géricault's painting acts as a "cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France's post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''".&lt;ref name="Wilkin"&gt;[[Karen Wilkin|Wilkin, Karen]].

[[File:Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly 1815 edited.jpg|thumb|In 1820, Géricault successfully exhibited the painting in the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[Piccadilly]], London.]]

The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the [[Sacred Heart|Sacred Heart of Jesus]], which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Géricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]]'s [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[Piccadilly]], London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="R72"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in [[French art]].

In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was a landmark in the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting, and "laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution"&lt;ref name="N14"&gt;Néret, 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; against the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style.  Géricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular [[history painting]] genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/david/ Jacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile]". [[Getty Museum]]. Retrieved 31 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], [[François Gérard]], [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]—teacher of both Géricault and Delacroix—and other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and [[Nicolas Poussin]].

[[File:Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau cropped.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Antoine-Jean Gros]], detail from ''Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau'', 1807, Louvre. Like Gros, Géricault had seen and felt the exhilaration of violence, and was distraught by the human consequences.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt;]]

In his introduction to ''The Journal of Eugène Delacroix'', Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, "The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. Gérard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire—some of them admirable—fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Wellingtonxi" /&gt;

''The Raft of the Medusa'' contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama.&lt;ref name="Boime141"&gt;Boime, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, "the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism".&lt;ref name="Christine"/&gt;

The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications of the extent to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.&lt;ref name="Wilkin"/&gt;

Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, "Géricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it."&lt;ref name=Wellingtonxi/&gt; The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as ''The Shipwreck of Don Juan'' (1840).&lt;ref name="N14" /&gt;

[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'', 1822. ''The Raft of the Medusa'''s influence on the work of the young Delacroix was immediately apparent in this painting, as well as in later works.&lt;ref name="N14" /&gt;]]

According to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', springs directly from Géricault's ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's own ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]''. Wellington wrote that "While Géricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, xv&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's  ''Massacre at Chios'' provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s monumental sculpture ''[[The Gates of Hell]]''. He wrote that "Delacroix's ''Massacre at Chios'' and Géricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies&amp;nbsp;... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'', he had Géricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' in front of him for encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like ''A Burial at Ornans'' (1849–50) and ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' (1855) owe a debt to ''The Raft of the Medusa''. The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events,&lt;ref&gt;

The influence of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was felt by artists beyond France. [[Francis Danby]], a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by Géricault's picture when he painted ''Sunset at Sea after a Storm'' in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was "the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;Noon, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Gulf Stream (painting)|The Gulf Stream]]'' (1899), by the American artist [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), replicates the composition of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the ''Argus'' from Géricault's painting.&lt;ref name="Dorment"&gt;Dorment, Richard. "Painting the Unpaintable". ''The New York Review of Books''. 27 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer's figure.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Randall C. ''Homer, Eakins &amp; Anshutz: The Search for American Identity in the Gilded Age''. Penn State Press, 2004. 102. {{ISBN|0-271-02329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to "sullen rage".&lt;ref name="Dorment" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, sculptor [[John Connell]], in his ''Raft Project'', a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated ''The Raft of the Medusa'' by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.&lt;ref&gt;ARTnews, Summer 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that Géricault's painting represents, "on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 12:32&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Kenneth Clark]], ''The Raft of the Medusa'' "remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove Géricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Today, a bronze [[Relief|bas-relief]] of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' by [[Antoine Étex]] adorns Géricault's grave in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 249&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">Evelyn’s Sharp’s short story '''"The Wonderful Toymaker"''' is part of a collection of fairy tales in the book, ''All the Way to Fairyland: Fairy Stories''. The Cambridge University Press originally published the anthology in 1897. An EBook version was made available through ''[[Project Gutenberg|The Project Gutenberg]]'' on 3 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm Sharp, Evelyn.

==Plot==
The tale of "The Wonderful Toymaker" begins with a spoiled princess named Petulant, an eight-year-old girl who cannot be pleased at any cost. Her father, the King, gathers his council together to help find a toy for the Princess that will surpass all others. The Prime Minister volunteers his son Martin to find the princess a special toy. Martin talks with Princess Petulant and promises to return in four weeks with an amazing toy.

At the beginning of Martin’s journey he encounters Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter who knows everything. Martin hopes that Bobolink will help him to find his way to The Wonderful Toymaker. However, Bobolink is annoyed about having to provide information about everything to everyone, and is initially reluctant to assist Martin. Martin’s lack of flattery towards him serves as a refreshing change, and Bobolink soon becomes quite eager to help him. Bobolink tells Martin that his next step is to reach the pine dwarfs, warning him to avoid conversation with the creatures or he will be stuck in the country of conversation forever. Martin almost makes it through the country of conversation without a single word, but he becomes distracted and engages in conversation with a fish. Martin’s error forces him to "become conversation," and suddenly he is trapped with no way out. The princess continues to wait patiently but she eventually becomes very upset that Martin has not returned with her toy. The council becomes worried, and contemplates where Martin could possibly be. The Princess, alone and sobbing, is confronted by a pine dwarf who promises to bring her to the waterfall and show her the way to Martin. The Princess stuffs her ears with cotton and begins her journey.

Princess Petulant finally makes it to Martin without speaking a single word, and they are both able to escape. The two run as fast as they can to the toyshop. The Toymaker, so pleased to see them, wishes that they stay and play with him forever. Martin and Princess Petulant play with the best toys they have ever seen, finally satisfying the Princess’ desire for a new toy. Martin and Princess Petulant tell the Toymaker that they are unable to stay and although he is sad, he assists them in their journey home. Upon their return they tell the entire story to a Royal Historian who records it all in the very book in which this story is contained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm Sharp, Evelyn.

==Author==

[[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] (4 August 1869 – 17 June 1955) was a British suffragette and Children's writer born in [[Denmark Hill]], London. She was prevented from receiving a formal education by her family for quite some time, but later entered school and attended [[Collège de France]]. Sharp began writing novels and short stories that reflected her understanding of children’s perspectives, as well as her evolving perspectives on life, social issues, and women's rights. In 1906, after becoming inspired by a speech by suffragette [[Elizabeth Robins]], she became active and devoted to the women’s suffrage movement. Sharp married [[Henry Nevinson]] in 1933. He died in 1941. Sharp fell into a depression and eventually became blind; she died in London in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V. "Sharp , Evelyn Jane (1869-1955)."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1016">{{Orphan|date=December 2017}}'''Theater shadowing''' is a technique used in stage acting in order to allow [[deaf]] viewers to understand. A [[sign language]] interpreter stands near the actor they are interpreting as their "shadow". Often it only takes two interpreters to shadow an entire performance by switching back and forth between different actors and groups of actors. They are also sometimes required to dance, dress in costume to blend in with the actors, and interact with the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terptheatre.com/technical.html |title=Sign Language Interpreting for the Theatre |publisher=TerpTheatre |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theater productions at the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]] often reverse this by having hearing actors shadow deaf actors and voice the signed parts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Thingiverse received an Honorable Mention in the Digital Communities category of the 2010 ARS Electronica | Prix Ars Electronica international competition for cyber-arts.&lt;ref name="2010 Prix Ars Electronica"&gt;{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://new.aec.at/prix/de/gewinner/2010/#digital-communities |title=2010 ARS Electronica &amp;#124; Prix Ars Electronica &amp;#124; Digital Communities &amp;#124; ANERKENNUNGEN |publisher=New.aec.at |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 25,000 designs uploaded to Thingiverse as of November 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew|title=Introducing MakerBot Thingiverse Dashboard And Follow Features|url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/11/07/introducing-makerbot-thingiverse-dashboard-and-follow-features/|publisher=Makerbot blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 100,000 in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JHoward|title=The 100,000th Thing on Thingiverse!|url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2013/06/08/100000th-thing-on-thingiverse/|publisher=Makerbot blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 400,000th Thing was published on the July 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:400000 400 000th thing on Thingiverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
The site is owned by [[MakerBot Industries]] and run by one of its founders,  [[Bre Pettis]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

In its terms of use, Thingiverse stipulates that users don't include content that "contributes to the creation of weapons, illegal materials or is otherwise objectionable". In 2012, Thingiverse removed an uploaded design for an entirely 3D-printed gun. In response, the gun's designers launched a new site specifically designed to host Thingiverse's "censored" files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Daily Dot | url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/thingiverse-pulls-weapons-guns-3d-printing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Source Hardware ==
Whereas many [[open source hardware]] projects are focused on project-specific materials, Thingiverse provides a common ground from which derivatives&lt;ref name="Prusa simplified mendel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4148 |title=Prusa simplified mendel by prusajr |publisher=Thingiverse.com |date=2010-09-18 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mashups&lt;ref name="Duplo Brick to Brio Track adapter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4041 |title=Duplo Brick to Brio Track adapter with snap-lock by Zydac |publisher=Thingiverse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; can form. These "derivatives" and "remixes" typically involve a user modifying or improving an existing design and re-uploading it. Because all models on the site are open source, this behavior is actively encouraged by the site and community. Designs that promote illegal activities or contribute to the creation of weapons are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/12/thingiverse-removes-gun-parts/|title=Thingiverse Removes (Most) Printable Gun Parts|last=Maly|first=Tim|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 3D printers can be upgraded with 3D printed parts. Thingiverse users produce many improvements and modifications for a variety of platforms. Popular examples of community-based 3D printer projects include the [[RepRap project]] and the [[Contraptor]] project. Some 3D printers can be almost entirely 3D printed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/reprap-snappy-is-the-most-3d-printable-3d-printer-yet-57957/ | title=Snappy: Most 3D Printable 3D printer yet | publisher = 3dprintingindustry.com | accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Venus and Mars''''' is an [[Italian Renaissance]] painting by [[Paolo Veronese]].

The painting was commissioned by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph]] and was one of three mythological and love-themed works commissioned by the artist. The other two are at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York: ''The Allegory of Virtue and Performance'' and ''Allegory of the Source of Wisdom and Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437891|title=Paolo Veronese (Paolo Caliari) {{!}} Mars and Venus United by Love {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the romantic love of the Roman goddess of love [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], as   described in the [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

== Description ==
The act of meeting the two lovers takes place in idyllic, peaceful scenery. On the left stands a naked goddess, with her left hand embracing the arrival of Mars, sitting in front of her in armor. The right hand of Venus rests on the breast from which the milk flows out, emphasizing its femininity. On the right side there is a war horse of god of war, tamed by one of the lovers. Its silhouette is based on antique horse monuments. The underlined musculature of the animal expresses his strength, and his inclined head and calm eyes soften his image. The two putti shown are the key to the interpretation of the work. The first taming horse symbolizes the subduction of the love desires of the god of Mars, the control over passions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Burroughs, ''Alan Criticism from a Laboratory'', Little Brown, Boston 1938, s.93-94, za. H. Rachlin&lt;/ref&gt; The second putto, which tied the ribbon around Venus' legs, symbolizes the union of lovers into eternal love and harmony in a time without wars. Milk from the breast of Venus symbolizes the wealth of peace, which is the food for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rachlin ''Skandale, wandale i niezwykłe opowieści o wielkich dziełach sztuki'' s.55&lt;/ref&gt;
The artist signed on a stone disc: "PAVLUS VERONENSIS F".

== Interpretation ==
Veronese kept the balance of composition. Each character has its own space, unmade by accidental elements. To get this picture the painter repeatedly repainted his work. X-ray study described by Alan Burroughs in his book ''Art Criticism from a Laboratory'' showed that the arrangement of Venus's body was different and was probably covered with drapery pulling downwards. The innocent cherub was not in the original version [2]. It is not clear why Veronese made these changes. Celebrity Venus had a completely different tone, more prudish, and lack of amora would give the scene a more mundane erotic meaning of meeting two lovers. The small changes made by the painter gave the work a new dimension of spirituality and innocence [3]

== Provenance ==
In 1621, a catalog was made of the works in the collection of Rudolf II in [[Prague Castle]]. Over the centuries, the painting had many owners and circulated throughout Europe. 
It was in the possession of [[Ferdinand III of Habsburg]], and after the Swedes' invasion of Prague in 1648, it entered the collection of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] and was taken with her in her Roman exile. It then went to the [[Erba-Odescalchi|Odescalchici family]], later to the famous [[Orleans Collection]] in Paris. In 1792, it went to the [[Edouard de Walckiers]] collection in Brussels but returned to Paris in 1798, and then went to London. After several English owners, in 1910 it was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''Ypotryll''' is a Medieval European chimeric creature featured in [[heraldry]]. It has the tusked head of a wild [[boar]] or hog, the humped body of a [[camel]], the legs and hooves of an [[ox]] or [[goat]] and the long, scaly tail of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. Its name is thought to be derived from the greek “hippo” (horse) or in [[Middle English]], “ypotame” itself derived from the latin "ypotamus". Though there isn’t much known of the creature’s meanings or origins, it appears as the badge of [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]], also known as the “Butcher of England”; a man known for his extreme cruelty in regards to the execution of Lancastrians during his rule as Lord High Constable in the early 1460s. The creature is known for its awesome ugliness, and is perhaps a reflection of those that wore it as their mark. Tiptoft was beheaded in 1470 by the Lancastrians during the War of the Roses (1455-1487). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rodney |last=Dennys |authorlink=Rodney Dennys |title=The Heraldic Imagination |place=London |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |year=1975 |page=166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
