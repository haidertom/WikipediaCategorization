'''(Abigail) May Alcott Nieriker''' (July 26, 1840 – December 29, 1879) was an [[United States|American]] artist and the youngest sister of [[Louisa May Alcott]]. She was the basis for the character Amy (an [[anagram]] of May) in her sister's [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical novel]] ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868). She was named after her mother, [[Abby May|Abigail May]], and first called Abba, then Abby, and finally May, which she asked to be called in November 1863 when in her twenties.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Her sister was the novelist [[Louisa May Alcott]], who supported her studies in Europe and with whom she had a fond relationship, although Louisa May was at times jealous of her family life as well as her ability to get what she wanted and needed.&lt;ref name="Alcott p. 12"&gt;Louisa May Alcott.

Artistic from an early age, she was the inspiration for Amy, one of the sisters in Louisa May Alcott's ''[[Little Women]]'', who was described as follows: "She was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Ticknor.''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlei_jkn6n0C&amp;pg=PA314 May Alcott]''.

== Art ==

=== 19th-century women artists ===
As educational opportunities were made more available in the 19th century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became "increasingly vocal and confident" in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer "[[New Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;Laura R. Prieto. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0bcXHa08knsC&amp;pg=PA145 At Home in the Studio: The Professionalization of Women Artists in America]''. Harvard University Press; 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-674-00486-3}}. pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists then, "played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives."&lt;ref&gt;Laura R. Prieto. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0bcXHa08knsC&amp;pg=PA160 At Home in the Studio: The Professionalization of Women Artists in America]''. Harvard University Press; 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-674-00486-3}}. p. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Beginning in 1859, Alcott studied art at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston]]. May Alcott visited Paris, studied at the [[Académie Julian]] in 1870 &lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/academiejulian/a/alcott-nieriker per school records]&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibited in both cities, as well as elsewhere in the USA and in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00002466?rskey=YtEvje&amp;result=9 Benezit]&lt;/ref&gt; She painted mainly flowers, but also made excellent copies of [[J. M. W. Turner]].  She studied art anatomy with [[William Rimmer]] in Boston, and also studied with [[William Morris Hunt]], Krug, Vautier and Müller among others.&lt;ref name=Appletons /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney p. 255"&gt;Ednah D. Cheney. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7isSoCYXwDAC&amp;pg=PA255 The Life of Louisa May Alcott]''. Cosimo, Inc.; 1 January 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-61640-251-8}}. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught art to young [[Daniel Chester French]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Sherwood Bonner McDowell. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PKnzjcs_2fAC&amp;pg=PA40 A Sherwood Bonner Sampler, 1869-1884: What a Bright, Educated, Witty, Lively, Snappy Young Woman Can Say on a Variety of Topics]''. Univ. of Tennessee Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-57233-067-2}}. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Rome]] during three European trips in 1870, 1873 and 1877, which were made possible by the publication in 1868 of her sister Louisa's book ''[[Little Women]]''.&lt;ref name="Orchard House Museum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney p. 255" /&gt; She traveled on at least one of the trips with Alice Bartlett and her sister Louisa May,{{#tag:ref|After the death of [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Alcott]]'s husband John Pratt in 1871, Louisa returned to Concord, while May stayed in Europe to begin serious study.
{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}|group="nb"}} where she "came into her own as an artist." She studied sculpture, sketching and painting.&lt;ref name=Maloni /&gt; In Europe she found that women had greater educational opportunities than in the United States, but the art academies did not allow women to paint live nude models. For that, she studied under Krug, who managed to enable both male and female students to paint live models.&lt;ref name="Barker p. 222"&gt;Deborah Barker, [https://www.questia.com/read/119482644 ''Aesthetics and Gender in American Literature: Portraits of the Woman Artist.''] Lewisburg, PA: Bucknell University Press, 2000. p. 222, Accessed via [[Questia]], an online subscription service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott had illustrated the first edition of ''Little Women'', to a negative critical reception. The early illustrations were made before her trips to and studies in Europe.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; In ''Little Women'', the character Amy was modeled after May.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Dinitia Smith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/27/books/from-alcott-a-parable-for-a-spirited-niece.html From Alcott, a Parable for a Spirited Niece."] The New York Times. March 27, 2002. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
After studying in Paris, she subsequently divided her time between Boston, London and Paris. Her strength was as a copyist and as a painter of still life, either in oils or watercolors. Her success as a copyist of Turner was such as to command the praise of Mr. Ruskin, and secure the adoption of some of her work for the pupils to copy at the South Kensington schools in London.&lt;ref name=Appletons /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Alcott, May|short= |noicon=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published ''Concord Sketches'' with a preface by her sister (Boston, 1869).&lt;ref name=Appletons /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Alcott, May|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having studied in Europe, she had become "an accomplished artist" by the 1870s, and her works during that time showed marked improvement compared to the earlier illustrations for ''Little Women'' and the "quirky" depiction of [[Walden Pond]] in ''Concord Sketches.'' Her works after her European studies and exposure to great works of art reflected "a surer hand, a clearer focus, and a broader vision as the world".&lt;ref name=Maloni /&gt;

In 1877, her [[still life]] was the only painting by an American woman{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} to be exhibited in the [[Paris Salon]],&lt;ref name="Orchard House Museum" /&gt; selected over the work of [[Mary Cassatt]]. She made portraits and paintings of exterior scenes, some with an oriental flair. [[John Ruskin]] praised her copies of [[J. M. W. Turner]], having called her "the foremost copyist of Turner of her time."&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; Her strength was as a copyist and as a painter of still life, in oils and watercolors, and she painted many panels featuring flowers on a black background. A panel of [[goldenrod]] given to neighbor/mentor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still hangs in his study. Several can also be seen at the [[Orchard House]] in Concord.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

She was living in London and studying landscape art when she met Ernest Nieriker. They married on March 22, 1878, in London. The marriage was said by authors Eiselein and Phillips to have occurred despite her family's reluctance.&lt;ref name="EiseleinPhillips2001" /&gt; In contrast, Louisa Alcott called the day a "happy event" and described Ernest as a handsome, cultivated and successful "tender friend".

The '''American Watercolor Society''', founded in 1866, is a nonprofit membership organization devoted to the advancement of [[watercolor|watercolor painting]] in the [[United States]]. 

Watercolor technique requires discipline, forethought, and planning of the composition, as the paintings can not be revised if mistakes occur (as one could with oil technique, for instance). AWS judges the work of a painter before granting admission to the society as an "active" (now "signature") member. Such membership in the society now is considered an indication of the painter having established a consistent style and to have demonstrated considerable skill in the medium. ''Transparency'' in the works of water color painters is highly valued. That is a technique wherein the paper surface is allowed to show through the applied paint as an integral aspect of the painting. The applicant usually must demonstrate a history of winning prizes in juried art shows with professional standing to gain admission. This type of membership in the society, generally, is signalled by "AWS" following the painter's name in promotional materials and biographies. Membership by others is indicated as an "associate" status.

[[Catherine Tharp Altvater]] (1907–1984) was the first woman to hold office in the society. In 2008 Jim McFarlane took over presidency from Janet Walsh.

==History==
The society was founded in 1866 by eleven painters and was originally known as the '''American Society of Painters in Water Colors'''.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=Erin Corley | year=2007 | title=American Watercolor Society records, 1867-1977, bulk 1950-1970 | work= | publisher=Archives of American Art Oral History Program | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-watercolor-society-records-8636/more | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was difficult to draw in new members, partially because some artists of the time opposed the society's policy of allowing women to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanwatercolorsociety.org/a_the_beginning.php|title=The Founding of the American Watercolor Society - New York 1866|website=www.americanwatercolorsociety.org|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''New York Watercolor Club''' merged into the society in 1941.

The '''New York Water Color Club''' (NYWC) was founded in 1890, accepting both men and women artists as members and officers, and held its first exhibition that year.&lt;ref name=SAAA&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-york-water-color-club-records-8150 | title=New York Water Color Club records, 1890 | publisher=Smithsonian Archives of American Art | accessdate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Childe Hassam]] was the organization's first president. NYWC was organized in response to refusal by the American Watercolor Society (AWS) to accept women members and to organize an annual exhibition in the fall. In comparison to AWS, it held jury-selected exhibitions which meant stricter standards for the content included in its shows.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan p. 224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Niamh O'Sullivan|author2=Aloysius O'Kelly|title=Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K4W8kWtqnkC&amp;pg=PA224|year=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=978-0-946755-42-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had male and female members and officers, whereas the American Watercolor Society did not accept women as members of their organization until 1897.&lt;ref name="SAAA-AWS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art2004 p. 36"&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Museum of Women in the Arts (U.S.)|author2=Columbus Museum of Art|title=Claude Raguet Hirst: Transforming the American Still Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkaKr4vBPWoC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=978-0-918881-54-0|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters and site of its annual exhibition was in the American Fine Arts Building at 215 West 57th Street.{{#tag:ref|The building was constructed as the result of the founding of the [[American Fine Arts Society]] in 1889. Other art organizations headquartered in the building were the [[American Federation of Arts]], American Water Color Society, [[Artists' Fund Society|Artists' Aid Society]], Mural Painters, and the [[Art Students League of New York]].

Of the 581 works of art, 501 of were watercolors.&lt;ref name="1918 AAD" /&gt;

The club combined exhibition venues with the American Water Color Society between 1922 and 1931. The two organizations merged, having created a new constitution, and was named the '''American Watercolor Society''' in January 1941.&lt;ref name="SAAA-AWS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-watercolor-society-records-8636/more | title=American Watercolor Society records, 1867-1977, bulk 1950-1970 | publisher=Smithsonian Archives of American Art | accessdate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Roy Henry Brown, president of the American Watercolor Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bernard Dearinger|title=Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design: 1826-1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHH45aYubp4C&amp;pg=PA72|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=978-1-55595-029-3|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist's proof''' is, at least in theory, an impression of a print taken in the [[printmaking]] process to see the current printing state of a plate while the plate (or stone, or woodblock) is being worked on by the artist. A proof may show a clearly incomplete image, often called a ''working proof'' or ''trial impression'', but in modern practice is usually used to describe an impression of the finished work that is identical to the numbered copies.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths, British Museum Press (in UK),2nd edn, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be ''printer's proofs'' which are taken for the printer to see how the image is printing, or are final impressions the printer is allowed to keep; but normally the term "artist's proof" would cover both cases.

Artist's proofs are not included in the count of a limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]], and sometimes the number of artist's proofs, which belong to the artist, can be twenty or more. By convention, the artist is not supposed to sell these at once.

==History==
The term "proof" is generally, but not consistently, applied only to prints from the late eighteenth-century onwards, beginning with the English [[mezzotint]]ers, who began the practice of issuing small editions of proofs for collectors, often before the "lettering" or inscription below the image was added.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt; The practices of signing or numbering impressions in the main edition had not begun, and in the absence of this, it is normally only when the image is clearly different from the final form that the term proof has any meaning.

In [[old master print]]s, a proof will be described as belonging to a different [[State (printmaking)|state]] of the print. States are numbered I, II, III etc., in the sequence they were produced, which can normally be determined.

For example, [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], who had his own printing-press and printed at least the earliest copies of his [[etching]]s himself, was a great taker of proofs, but these are normally described as different states - his record was nine for one etching, although this involved returning to an older print he had sold many copies of, and largely reworking it.

But the term proof can be used in the case of a clear working proof of an [[old master print]], like the two impressions of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''Adam and Eve''  (1504, [[British Museum]] and [[Albertina, Vienna]]) which show the figures largely finished but the background with only the main outlines lightly done.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;

== Status ==

Art historians, curators, and collectors view working proofs as especially desirable because of their rarity, the insight they may give into the progress of the work, and because they may well have belonged to the artist. Especially in the case of dead artists, they can be the only evidence of the artist's incremental development of an image, something not usually available with [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, or [[sculpture]]. Some lithographs may be hand signed in the border and labeled "Epreuve D'Artiste", which means Artist's Proof, which also increases its value.

Collectors also usually prefer final artist's proofs even when they are identical to the main edition; if nothing else the print may have been presented to a friend by the artist.  Prints are generally sold as limited editions, with a print being cheaper than a drawing or painting because the artist/gallery makes more money by selling multiples. An artist's proof has special value because of its extra rarity and its possible differences from the "standard" print, factors that are often reflected in its price.

== Printshop technicians ==

Since many printmaking processes require expensive equipment, most artists choose to work with specialist printers. The print shop provides technicians skilled in the process; the artist provides the art. It is customary in these cases to pay the technicians with a signed artist's proof, in addition to his wages. The print shop will also retain a proof, normally signed off as "bon à tirer" ("good for printing" in French) to use as a control example against which the other impressions are compared. This has resulted in some very impressive collections of prints owned by printmakers themselves.

An artist's proof is also known as a "comp" or "complimentary" if given to printers.

'''BBC Alba''' is a [[Scottish Gaelic]] language [[digital television]] channel jointly owned by the [[BBC]] and [[MG Alba]]. The channel was launched on 19 September 2008 and is on-air for up to seven hours a day. The name ''{{lang|gd|[[Alba]]}}'' is the Scottish Gaelic name for [[Scotland]]. The station is unique in that it is the first channel to be delivered under a BBC licence by a partnership and is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Gaelic digital TV channel debated| publisher = [[BBC Online]]| date = 29 August 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6968320.stm| accessdate = 3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/local/alba_eng.shtml |title=Commissioning - BBC Alba |publisher=BBC |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7556739.stm |title=Launch date for Gaelic TV channel |publisher=BBC News |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Alba has an average viewership of 637,000 adults over the age of 16 in Scotland each week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.mgalba.com/downloads/reports/annual-report-12-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; BBC Alba got 4.1 million views on BBC iPlayer between 2012–2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland}}

In 2007, the [[BBC Trust]] opened a consultation for a Gaelic digital service in partnership with the [[MG Alba|Gaelic Media Service]]. Following the BBC Trust consultation in November 2007, the [[Audience Council Scotland]] recommended their support for the creation of the service on 7 December 2007, stating that the Trust should pursue carriage of the service on digital terrestrial television and that existing "gaelic zone" programming on [[BBC Scotland]] should remain after the launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/aboutus/acs/content/meetings/minutes.shtml?minutes=minutes20071207 |title=Audience Council Scotland - Meeings |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/aboutus/acs/content/audience/submissions.shtml |title=Audience Council Scotland - Audience |publisher=BBC |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2008, the BBC Trust gave the go-ahead for a Gaelic channel.

The channel began broadcasting on satellite at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 19 September 2008 with a launch video featuring a new rendition of the [[Runrig]] song, ''{{lang|gd|Alba}}''. The first part of a live [[céilidh]] from [[Skye]], presented by Mary Ann Kennedy, was followed by a specially produced comedy drama entitled ''{{lang|gd|Eilbheas}}'' (Elvis), starring [[Greg Hemphill]] as [[Elvis Presley]], at 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. The channel's first independent commission, ''{{lang|gd|Peter Manuel – Deireadh an Uilc?}}'' (''Peter Manuel - The End of Evil?''), a drama documentary produced by [[STV Productions]], was shown at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm before the opening night closed with the second half of the live celidh from Skye. The launch night was simulcast on [[BBC Two Scotland]] between 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm and there was a launch event held at the [[National Museum of Scotland]], which was recorded by the channel's news service ''{{lang|gd|[[An Là]]}}''.

A study carried out for the channel indicated that 650,000 people watched BBC Alba per week in the first two months of broadcasting, in spite of only being available to around a third of Scots.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7693193.stm |title=Viewer figure boost for Gaelic TV |publisher=BBC News |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being subject to a review by the BBC Trust and a recommendation from the [[Audience Council Scotland]] in 2009, a plan was announced to broadcast the channel on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], in Scotland only, from the digital switchover (2010) under the proviso that reach of the service extended beyond the core Gaelic audience to 250,000. This was approved on 27 December 2010 by the BBC Trust&lt;ref name="Freeview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/december/bbc_alba.shtml|title=Trust approves BBC Alba carriage on Freeview|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the service launched on Freeview on 8 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13479551|title=BBC Alba Freeview date unveiled|publisher=BBC News|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel also launched on Virgin Media (Scotland only) on 18 May 2011,&lt;ref name=VirginLaunch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmediascotland.com/press_news/30026/bbc-alba-to-begin-broadcasting-on-virgin-tv|title=BBC Alba to Begin Broadcasting on Virgin TV|publisher=allmediascotland|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgin Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=126782 |title=BBC Alba Launches on Virgin Media |publisher=4RFV.co.uk |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521033850/http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=126782 |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made available nationwide on the Virgin Media and Sky platforms, the former on 6 November 2012.

== Operation ==

[[File:BBC Scotland.jpg|thumb|Pacific Quay in Glasgow, from where BBC Alba is transmitted.]]

BBC Alba is broadcast for up to seven hours a day in the [[United Kingdom]] on satellite platforms [[Sky UK|Sky]] and [[Freesat]], cable provider [[Virgin Media]] and on digital terrestrial provider [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in Scotland only. Programmes are also available to watch on the internet live through services including the [[BBC iPlayer]] and some programmes are available for seven days after broadcast on this service and on catch up services of some other services.

The channel is financed from the [[BBC Scotland]] budget and by MG Alba, which itself is financed by the [[Scottish Government]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]. The BBC spent £8 million on the channel, of which £5 million was used for programming, in 2011/12&lt;ref name="BBC report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=The BBC Executive's Review and Assessment|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_executive_2011_12.pdf|work=Annual Report and Accounts 2011/12|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2012|pages=2–64|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MG Alba applies the majority of its budget (£12.4 million in 2008/09) to the Gaelic Digital Service.

BBC Alba has four studios across Scotland, located in [[Stornoway]], [[Glasgow]], [[Inverness]] and [[Portree]]. Continuity and channel management is based in Stornoway while the news services are based in Inverness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgalba.com/en/rhs_links/faqs.html |title=MG Alba - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[MG Alba]] |date=19 September 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413090258/http://www.mgalba.com/en/rhs_links/faqs.html| archivedate= 13 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short pre-recorded information program called ''{{lang|gd|Dè Tha Dol}}'' is sent from Stornoway and is played out at 7:55&amp;nbsp;pm daily. [[BBC Scotland]]'s headquarters at [[Pacific Quay]] in Glasgow is used to transmit the programmes.&lt;ref name="mgalba.com"/&gt; The First Minister, [[Alex Salmond]] opened the new BBC Alba studio in Portree in August 2008 where he recorded a message for the launch of BBC Alba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/This-Week/Media-Briefings/080825 |title=Media Briefing |date=25 August 2008 |work=www.scotland.gov.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

BBC Alba combines [[television]], [[radio]] and [[on-line]] programme content, and is anticipated to have a positive impact at many levels including increasing artistic and technical skills, extending economic opportunities, stimulating parents' interest in [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]], appealing to and serving the adult learners and strengthening Gaelic usage in extremely important media. It holds significant potential to assist with the development of positive attitudes to the acquisition and transmission of Gaelic. BBC Alba broadcasts more Scottish sport than any other channel, with over three hours a week of football, rugby and shinty. In addition, the station also broadcasts a live news programme for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes every weekday.

=== Programming ===

MG Alba and the BBC have announced that around ninety minutes of television content daily will be new material. Output on the station consists of news, current affairs, sport, drama, documentary, entertainment, education, religion and children's programming, broadcast on most days between 5&amp;nbsp;pm and 12&amp;nbsp;am. Sport programmes began on Saturday 20 September 2008 and news services on Monday 22 September 2008.&lt;ref name="mgalba.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgalba.com/faq_english.html |title=MG Alba Fios Naidheachd |publisher=Mgalba.com |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081414/http://www.mgalba.com/faq_english.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's programmes are shown for two hours every weekday, between 17:00 and 19:00. Current affairs series ''{{lang|gd|[[Eòrpa]]}}'' and children's magazine show ''{{lang|gd|[[Dè a-nis?]]}}'' are broadcast on Thursday nights on BBC Alba and also continue to be shown on [[BBC Two Scotland]] at their usual timeslots on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/tbh/eorpa/english/index.shtml |title=Alba Eòrpa (English) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nightly half-hour news programme, ''{{lang|gd|[[An Là]]}}'', is aired on weeknights at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm with newsreaders Angela Maclean and Iain Maclean. Radio Personality of the Year, Derek 'Pluto' Murray, is their resident sports reporter. ''{{lang|gd|[[Spòrs]]}}'' on Saturday nights features weekly coverage of a selected [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] match. ''{{lang|gd|[[Rugby Beo]]}}'' broadcasts one live Magners League rugby union game a week, involving one of the competition's Scottish teams. A Gaelic-learning programme, ''[[Speaking our Language]]'' is re-broadcast on weeknights at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Former ''{{lang|gd|Eòrpa}}'' reporter, Derek Mackay hosts a weekly chat show, ''{{lang|gd|Cnag na Cùise}}'', on Sunday nights. So far two series of current affairs documentary ''{{lang|gd|[[Trusadh]]}}'' has been commissioned as of 2010, which is sometimes presented by [[Donald MacSween]].

BBC Alba also fund new programming, such as ''[[Fraochy Bay]]''.

=== Subtitling ===

Most of the adult programming on BBC Alba contains on-screen [[English language|English]] [[subtitles]].  For logistical reasons, live broadcasts (including the news) are not subtitled, although certain events (e.g. the annual [[Hogmanay]] broadcast ''{{lang|gd|Bliadhna Mhath Ùr}}'') have scripted elements that are subtitled, while interviews and ad-libbed lines are not.

Children's programmes are not subtitled. Controversially, no English dialogue on the channel is subtitled into Gaelic.

=== Sport ===

BBC Alba concentrates on three sports: [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[shinty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football-news/scottish-football/scottish-football-league/2008/07/31/sfl-s-delight-at-joy-sponsorship-deal-for-challenge-cup-86908-20678564/ |title=SFL's delight at joy sponsorship deal for Challenge Cup |publisher=The Daily Record |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009–10 season, the station broadcast one full [[Scottish Premier League]] game every Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/7507443.stm |title=BBC Gaelic to screen SPL matches |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game selected was always one not covered by either live [[Sky Sports]] or on an on-demand basis by [[BT Vision]] and was shown three hours after the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/naidheachdan/story/2008/07/080715_gaelic_spl.shtml |title=Geamaichean a' Phrìomh Lìog air an t-Seirbheis Dhidseataich |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}} {{gd icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matches only included Gaelic commentary along with English subtitles.

The channel reached an agreement with the [[Scottish Football League]] to broadcast live [[association football|football]] games during the 2008–09 season. This began with the final of the [[Scottish Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]], which was also sponsored by MG Alba.&lt;ref name = "SFL"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7867162.stm BBC Alba to screen live SFL games], [[BBC Sport]], 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC Alba then started broadcasting [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] games, beginning with the match between [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] on 22 February 2009.&lt;ref name = "SFL"/&gt;

BBC Alba also struck a deal with the Scottish rugby authorities to show one live rugby, [[Scottish Premiership Division One]] match every weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=David |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/Scottish-clubs-agree--to.4555181.jp |title=Scottish clubs agree to BBC Alba showing ten games live - Scotsman.com Sport |publisher=Sport.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2015-16 season, BBC Alba will show 20 live matches (excluding [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]) from either [[2015-16 Scottish Championship]] (including the play-off final), [[2015–16 Scottish League One|League 1]] or [[2015–16 Scottish League One|League 2]] as well as four matches from the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]]. The station also altered their coverage of [[Scottish Premiership]] highlights, showing one hour highlights of two non-televised matches on a Saturday and Sunday night at 22:00. Other football coverage includes all [[Scotland U21s]] and [[Scotland national women's football team|Women's]] matches. As well as the final of the [[2015-16 Scottish Junior Cup]].

In 2010 BBC Alba bought the rights for [[Pro14|Celtic League]] rugby jointly with public service broadcasters from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7813469/Celtic-Rugby-secure-improved-broadcast-deal-for-Magners-League-coverage.html|title=Celtic Rugby secure improved broadcast deal for Magners League coverage|last=Clutton|first=Graham|date=9 June 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent production companies ===

A number of independent companies have been commissioned to produce content for the channel, or have productions currently airing. These include:

* Theatre Hebrides (''{{lang|gd|Lostbost}}'')
* Madmac Productions (''Broadford or Bust'')
* Caledonia Stern and Wylde (''{{lang|gd|Tìr is Teanga}}'')
* MnE Media, formerly known as ''{{lang|gd|Meadhan nan Eilean}}'' (''{{lang|gd|Seasaidh Lexy}}'', ''{{lang|gd|[[Cuide ri Cathy]]}}'')
* Tern TV (''{{lang|gd|Slighe gu Biadh}}'')
* Eyeline Media (''{{lang|gd|Air an Rathad}}'', ''{{lang|gd|Làrach anns an Fhàsach}}'')
* MacTV (''{{lang|gd|Ealtainn}}'')
* Studio Alba (''{{lang|gd|A' Gharaids}}'')

== Criticism ==

=== Lack of Gaelic content and emphasis on English ===

The Gaelic community, including writers {{lang|gd|[[Aonghas MacNeacail]]}}, [[Angus Peter Campbell]], Lisa Storey and musician Allan MacDonald, have criticised the non-availability of Gaelic subtitles, and the emphasis on English language interviews and reportage in the channel's content for adults. Writers and authors were reported by the BBC Gaelic news service as setting up a campaign, GAIDHLIG.TV, to increase Gaelic content on Alba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BBC Alba is not a Gaelic channel|author= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/naidheachdan/29125194|newspaper= |date= 9 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014 |work=BBCAlbaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to introduce 'red button facilities' to allow viewers to switch to English language sports commentary, first announced in August 2014 for rugby and the Guinness Pro12 series, was heavily criticised by the Gaelic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= English content on ALBA harmful to Gaelic development |author=Allan MacDonald and Lisa Storey |url= http://www.gaidhlig.tv/post/96634203357/litir-gu-whfp-2014 |newspaper=West Highland Free |date= 11 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism resulted in MG Alba announcing publicly in the West Highland Free Press that the 'red button option' for English language commentary would not expand to other sports or areas of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Freagairt do draghan mu MG ALBA |author= |url= http://www.whfp.co.uk |newspaper=West Highland Free Press |date= 11 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014 |language=gd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports programming ===

Between its launch in September 2008 and the beginning of 2010, the BBC Alba channel lost a third of its viewers, but its number of viewers remains five times larger than the size of the Gaelic speech community in Scotland (just over 58,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnag.org.uk/munghaidhlig/stats/gspeakcensus01.php |title=CnaG ¦ Census 2001 Scotland: Gaelic speakers by council area |publisher=Cnag.org.uk |date= |accessdate=23 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427072929/http://www.cnag.org.uk/munghaidhlig/stats/gspeakcensus01.php| archivedate= 27 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The historian Michael Fry has argued that many of its viewers only watch it for the football coverage, because "you don't need Gaelic to watch football", and that in this way the channel is "cheating".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The model is, however, both common and intentional as it is on comparable channels such as the [[Irish language]] channel [[TG4]], the [[Basque language|Basque]] broadcaster [[EITB]] or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] channel [[S4C]]. In Europe, these channels' main mission is not commercial, but the promotion of the original languages.

=== Freeview ===

Some criticism had been levied over the channel's addition to Freeview, primarily due to the BBC's original plan (with acceptance from the BBC Executive) to remove all 13 BBC Radio channels from Freeview for Scottish viewers over the period that BBC Alba will be shown on Freeview (between 5&amp;nbsp;pm and midnight); however the criticism has not been directed at the BBC's decision to extend BBC Alba to Freeview in principle.&lt;ref name=Freeview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BBC Alba to be shown on Freeview|author= |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-12049472|newspaper= |date= 21 December 2010|accessdate=27 January 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2011, it was reported that the BBC has backed down on the plans, after the BBC had "managed to reengineer facilities" to allow [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] and [[BBC 6 Music|6 Music]] to continue to broadcast on a 24-hour basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlibdems.org.uk/scottish-lib-dems/bbc-change-of-heart-on-digital-radio-simple-common-sense.html |title=BBC change of heart on digital radio 'simple common sense' |publisher=Scottish Lib Dems |date=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521022349/http://www.glasgowlibdems.org.uk/scottish-lib-dems/bbc-change-of-heart-on-digital-radio-simple-common-sense.html |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three stations were chosen because they have the highest evening audience ratings on digital television of the seven BBC radio stations unavailable on FM radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/05/bbc_alba_on_freeview.html|title=BBC Alba on Freeview|publisher=BBC Internet Blog|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 2 December 2013, it was confirmed that more radio stations were made available 24 hours in Scotland, but with some trade-offs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/posts/I-can-hear-it-coming-in-the-air-tonight-the-return-of-five-radio-stations-in-the-evenings-on-Freeview-in-Scotland|title=I can hear it coming In the air tonight: the return of five radio stations in the evenings on Freeview in Scotland |publisher=BBC About the BBC Blog|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 4]], [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|4 Extra]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra|5 Live Sports Extra]], [[BBC Radio Scotland]] and [[BBC Asian Network]] were restored, but as noted in the blog with some technical trade-offs, such as mono audio rather than stereo during the evenings on the radio stations mentioned and the audio bit rate of the TV channels in Scotland on Freeview reduced to 192kbit/s from 256kbit/s.

'''Carving''' is the act of using [[tool]]s to shape something from a material by scraping away portions of that material. The technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available tools. Carving, as a means for making [[sculpture]], is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like [[clay]], [[fruit]], and melted [[glass]], which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz, ''Children Are Artists: An Introduction to Children's Art for Teachers and Parents'' (1953), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinds of carving include:
* [[Bone carving]]
* [[Chip carving]]
* [[Fruit carving]]
* Gourd carving or [[gourd art]]
* Ice carving or [[ice sculpture]]
* [[Ivory carving]]
* [[Stone carving]]
** [[Petroglyph]]
* [[Vegetable carving]]
**[[Thaeng yuak]] (Banana stalk carving)
* [[Wood carving]]

'''''Chloé''''' is a 260 by 139&amp;nbsp;cm oil canvas painting of a young Parisian girl by French figure painter [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]], made in 1875. The painting is located in the upstairs bar of the [[Young and Jackson Hotel]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, where it has been since 1909.&lt;ref&gt;"Chloe at the Young &amp; Jackson Hotel." Melbourne Online. Melbourne Online Pty Ltd, n.d. Web. 18 March 2014. &lt;http://www.melbourne.com.au/chloe.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as the "Melbourne Icon" and is the mascot of {{HMAS|Melbourne|FFG 05|6}}.&lt;ref name=OM&gt;[http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/chloe-jules-joseph-lefebvre "''Chloe'' – Jules-Joseph Lefebvre"], details, OnlyMelbourne.com.au. Retrieved 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Chloé'' made its first debut in the [[Paris Salon]] in 1875 with great success. With that success, it and Lefebvre won the Gold Medal of Honour in 1875. It was subsequently displayed in art exhibitions such as the French Gallery at the [[Sydney International Exhibition]] in 1879 and the [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)|Melbourne International Exhibition]] in 1880.

''Chloé'' was then purchased by Dr. Thomas Fitzgerald of [[Lonsdale Street]], Melbourne, for 850 guineas.&lt;ref name=OM /&gt; Controversy arose when the painting was to be exhibited on Sundays. The [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria|Presbyterian Assembly]] found the painting to be too scandalous to show on Sundays, so it had to eventually be taken down from galleries.&lt;ref&gt;"Chloe." Young and Jackson. ALH Group, n.d. Web. 18 March 2014 &lt;http://www.youngandjacksons.com.au/downloads/chloe_history.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Upon  Fitzgerald's death in 1908, the painting was auctioned off to Norman Figsby Young.&lt;ref name=OM /&gt; Henry Young and Thomas Jackson bought ''Chloé'' in 1908 from Norman Figsby Young and placed the painting in the bar of their hotel.&lt;ref name=OM /&gt;

==Influence on soldiers==
''Chloé'' captivated the love of many soldiers during [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]], who frequented the bar before they left for battle. Thousands of soldiers would go to the Young and Jacksons Hotel to drink and to see her for company. Letters were even addressed to her from the trench wars of Turkey, France, and Papua New Guinea, promising to return to her. American soldiers went as far as coming up with a plan to abduct her.&lt;ref name=OM /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
* Paris Salon Exhibition, 1875 
* [[Sydney International Exhibition]], 1879 
* [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)]]
* Adelaide Gallery Exhibition, 1883 
* Blamey House Women's Auxiliary 
* Fundraiser, 1940 
* National Gallery of Victoria 1883, 1995, 2000

==Awards==
* 1875 – won gold medal of Honour
* 1879 – Won highest award at the Sydney International Exhibition
* 1880 – Won highest award at the Melbourne International Exhibition

==Damage and restoration==
On Friday, 24 September 2004, at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a patron from the pub fell against the painting and caused long vertical cracks on the {{convert|5|mm|adj=on}} thick protective glass.&lt;ref name=Age&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/27/1096137172031.html "Chloe's encounter scratches surface"] by Selma Milovanovic, ''[[The Age]]'', 28 September 2004. Retrieved 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Art experts said the damage was minor and would not affect the overall value of the painting.&lt;ref name=Age /&gt; The painting was repaired at the Ian Potter Conservation Centre in the [[Ian Potter Museum of Art]] in Melbourne, where it waited for German glass to be imported as a new protectant. The painting was finally restored and put back in the Young and Jackson Hotel on 13 October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Ignacio, ed. "Melbourne's Famous 'Chloe' Painting Restored." Art Daily. Ignacio Villarreal, n.d. Retrieved 18 March 2014.&lt;http://artdaily.com/news/11354/Melbourne-s-Famous--Chloe--Painting-Restored#.UykxzuhX-uZ&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The model==
The model for this painting was named Marie, not Chloé. She was born to a poor family in 1856, and was of Persian descent. She left home at a young age and started posing for artists in order to gain some income for herself and her sister. She was 19 when Lefebvre painted her for ''Chloé''. Considerable controversy surrounds her relationship with Lefebvre, which much disagreement as to the exact nature of the relationship. Some have said that she had a sexual relationship with him, while others have said that he rejected her.&lt;ref&gt;"''Chloe'' – Queen of the Bar Room Wall." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Retrieved 18 March 2014.&lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A950159&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Another account says that he seduced both Marie and her sister. Whatever the truth was, a year after Lefebvre completed the ''Chloé'' painting, he married her sister. A year after that, Marie hosted a party with close friends, during which she slipped away into the kitchen and made and drank a poisonous substance. The exact reason for her suicide remains unknown but some have speculated that she did it because of her unrequited love for Lefebvre.&lt;ref&gt;"Chloe." Young and Jackson. ALH Group, n.d. Retrieved 18 March 2014.&lt;http://www.youngandjacksons.com.au/downloads/chloe_history.pdf &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young and Jackson Hotel==
''Chloé'' is to remain part of the hotel forever, as decided by the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust and Heritage of Victoria]] in 1988. The hotel holds free information tours and sessions to teach people the history, origins, and the prominence of the painting.

'''Copyright for Creativity - A Declaration for Europe'''  issued on 5 May 2010, is intended as a statement of how [[copyright]] [[policy]] could be constructed in the Internet Age. It comes against the background of political debate within Europe to rethink [[copyright]] in an era where the use of digital content without paying fees to the creators is part of the business model for some of the largest global internet platforms. Interests of content creators and online platform providers collide. The declaration has been written by a group from political party "[[European People's Party|European People's Party (EPP)]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12101.htm] Rethinking Creative Rights for the Internet age.

The Declaration reads:{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Copyright for Creativity – A Declaration for Europe'''

''"Humanity's capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development."''
Adelphi Charter

The development of new technologies underpinning the [[knowledge economy]] calls for a review of the copyright aquis. Together, we need to create greater incentives to maximise creativity, innovation, education and access to culture, and secure Europe's competitiveness.

Exclusive rights stimulate investment and the production of cultural and knowledge based goods. Simultaneously, exceptions* to those rights create a balanced system that allow for the use of creative works to support innovation, creation, competition and the public interest. Well-crafted exceptions can serve both goals: preserving rewards and incentives for creators while also encouraging innovative re-uses that benefit the public.

While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright's exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment.

Europe requires a balanced, flexible and harmonised system of exceptions that is in step with the 21st Century knowledge economy. The European Commission took a first step with the publication of the Green Paper, "Copyright in the Knowledge Economy." The signatories of this declaration call upon the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States to take this Declaration into account and engage in policy and norm-setting on copyright exceptions to:

* '''Harmonise Exceptions Across Europe.''' Copyright regulates the flow of consumer as well as knowledge goods in the single market. For European citizens and industry alike, the harmonisation of exceptions is a necessary step to facilitate cross-border trade, and create equality and clarity before the law.
* '''Act as a Spur to Innovation:''' New technologies make it possible to expand users' access to vast quantities of relevant knowledge and content. Copyright exceptions must support the development and usage of these innovative services, improving European users' access to content.
*'''Support User Creativity and Wider Participation:''' The Internet has facilitated an unprecedented shift for citizens, from being passive consumers of "broadcast" culture to active creators and participants. Individual users are increasingly involved in content and knowledge creation. The European copyright framework needs to reflect this new interactivity which encourages creativity, cultural diversity and self-expression.
*''' Ensure Accessibility by all Europeans:''' Exceptions must balance the protection of the creators' rights with the public interest and must fully support improving access to knowledge and content for people with disabilities – most notably through the use of new technologies.
*''' Support for Education and Research:''' Information and communication technologies offer new collaborative ways to develop and share educational and research materials.Copyright exceptions that facilitate new technology-based research and education will propel science and learning, and therefore the knowledge economy, exponentially forward.
*'''Facilitate Preservation and Archiving:''' Digitisation of content is offering new opportunities not only to preserve but also extend the accessibility of Europe's knowledge and cultural heritage with wide-reaching and long-term benefits for society as a whole. The copyright framework must support this.
*'''Ensure Monopoly Rights are Regulated in the Online Environment:''' Limitations and exceptions act to counterbalance the lack of competition that is created by the granting of monopoly rights in copyright law. In order to protect creativity and innovation we must ensure that these monopoly rights are also regulated in the online environment.
*'''Promote these Principles in International Discussions.''' The principles and objectives we endorse should not apply only to Europeans – they should be at the centre of the EU's contributions in any discussions in multilateral and bilateral fora it participates in.

''* Copyright law enable an exclusive right to creators to regulate and control the use of their work as they wish. Limitations and exceptions balance the monopoly right of the creator, in the public interest. For example to promote education and learning, support a free press, deal with market failure etc.''{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Cropping''' is the removal of unwanted outer areas from a photographic or illustrated image. The process usually consists of the removal of some of the peripheral areas of an image to remove extraneous trash from the picture, to improve its [[framing (visual arts)|framing]], to change the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], or to accentuate or isolate the subject matter from its background. Depending on the application, this can be performed on a physical photograph, artwork, or film footage, or it can be achieved [[workstation|digitally]] by using [[image editing]] [[software]]. The process of cropping is common to the [[photography|photographic]], [[film]] processing, [[broadcasting]], [[graphic design]], and [[offset printing|printing]] businesses.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the removal of unwanted areas from the periphery of a photographic or illustrated [[image]]. Cropping is one of the most basic [[photo manipulation]] processes, and it is carried out to remove an unwanted object or irrelevant noise from the periphery of a [[photograph]], to change its aspect ratio, or to improve the overall [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.croppola.com
 | title = Automatic image cropping to improve composition
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In telephoto photography, most commonly in avian and [[aviation]] photography, an image is cropped to magnify the primary subject and further reduce the angle of view -- when a lens of sufficient focal length to achieve the desired magnification directly was not available. It is considered one of the few editing actions permissible in modern [[photojournalism]] along with tonal balance, color correction and [[unsharp masking|sharpening]]. A cropping made by trimming off the top and bottom margins of a photograph, or a film, produces an view that mimics the [[panoramic photography|panoramic]] format (in photography) or the [[widescreen]] format in [[cinematography]] and [[broadcasting]]. Neither of these formats is cropped as such, but rather they are products of highly specialized optical configurations and camera designs.

=== Graphic examples (photography) ===
'''Cropping in order to emphasize the subject:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Calanit004.jpg|Cropped image of [[Anemone coronaria]], aspect ratio 1.065, in which the flower fills most of the frame
File:Kalanit01.jpg|The original photo, aspect ratio 1.333, in which the flower uses only a small part of the frame
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Cropping in order to remove unwanted details/objects:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Chartzit001.JPG|Cropped image of [[Garland chrysanthemum]], aspect ratio 16:4
File:Teva 17 3 (64).JPG|The original photo,  aspect ratio 1.333, the lower right part shows some white-colored trash and the upper right shows a dead flower, and both are unwanted objects.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Cropping in cinematography &amp; broadcasting==

In certain circumstances, film footage may be cropped to change it from one aspect ratio to another, without stretching the image or filling the blank spaces with [[letterbox]] bars (fig. 2).

Concerns about aspect ratios are a major issue in [[filmmaking]]. Rather than cropping, the cinematographer usually uses [[Open matte|mattes]] to increase the latitude for alternative aspect ratios in projection and broadcast. [[Anamorphic format|Anamorphic]] optics (such as [[Panavision]]  lenses) produce a [[full-frame]], horizontally compressed image from which broadcasters and projectionists can matte a number of alternative aspect ratios without cropping relevant image detail. Without this, widescreen reproduction, especially for television broadcasting, is dependent upon a variety of soft matting techniques such as letterboxing, which involves varying degrees of image cropping [http://www.filmbug.com/dictionary/aspect-ratios.php](see figures 2, 3 and 4)

Since the advent of [[widescreen]] television, a similar process removes large chunks from the top &amp; bottom to make a standard 4:3 image fit a 16:9 one, losing 25 percent of the original image. This process has become standard in the United Kingdom,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} for television programs in which many archive clips are used. This gives them a zoomed-in, cramped image with reduced ??. Another option is a process called [[Letterbox#Pillarboxing and windowboxing|pillarboxing]], where black bands are placed down the sides of the screen, allowing the original image to be shown full-frame within the wider aspect ratio (fig. 6). See [[Aspect ratio (image)#criticism|this article]] for a fuller description of the problem.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional methods==
Various methods may be used following cropping or may be used on the original image.
* [[Vignetting]] is the accentuation of the central portion of an image by blurring, darkening, lightening, or desaturation of peripheral portions of the image
* The use of nonrectangular [[Mat (picture framing)|mat]] or [[picture frame]] may be used for selection of portions of a larger image

==Uncropping==
It is not possible to "uncrop" a cropped image unless the original still exists or undo information exists: if an image is cropped and saved (without undo information), it cannot be recovered without the original.

However, using [[texture synthesis]], it is possible to artificially add a band around an image, synthetically "uncropping" it. This is effective if the band smoothly blends with the existing image, which is relatively easy if the edge of the image has low detail or is a chaotic natural pattern such as sky or grass, but does not work if discernible objects are cut off at the boundary, such as half a car. An [http://registry.gimp.org/node/16113 uncrop] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] exists for the [[GIMP]] image editor.

[[File:IngresPedroKissSwordOfHenri4.jpg|thumb|240px|''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword'', 1819 version, [[château de Pau]]]]
[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - The Sword of Henry IV - WGA11851.jpg|thumb|240px|''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword'', 1832, the [[Louvre]]]]
'''''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword''''' is an 1814 painting in the [[Troubador style]] by the French artist [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], showing the Spanish ambassador [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca]] kissing the sword of [[Henry IV of France]] (held by a young page) in the salle des Caryatides of the Louvre palace. The painting is now lost. Between 1819 and 1832, Ingres painted three additional paintings of the subject.

==History==
Episodes from the life of Henri IV were a frequent subject for French painters in Ingres' time.&lt;ref name="Condon_238"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 238. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident depicted in this painting was described by Ingres in one of his notebooks:&lt;blockquote&gt;One day Don Pedro of Toledo, the Ambassador of Spain to the court of Henri IV, saw in the Louvre the sword of the King in the hands of a young page. Advancing, he knelt on the ground and kissed it, rendering honor, he said, to the most glorious sword in Christendom.&lt;ref name="Condon_238"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The artist painted four versions of the subject between 1814 and 1832.

The original version was painted in 1814 and exhibited at the Paris Salon that year, where it was disparaged by critics.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"&gt;Radius, Emilio (1968). ''L'opera completa di Ingres''. Milan: Rizzoli. p. 96. {{OCLC|58818848}}&lt;/ref&gt; After even Ingres' friends found fault with it, Ingres reworked in 1820. The revised composition included the figures of the [[Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette|Duc d'Epernon]] and [[Gabrielle d'Estrées]] behind the ambassador and the page.&lt;ref name="Condon_78"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 78. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the painting since the mid-19th century is unknown.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; The composition of the painting before its revision is recorded in an engraving by Achille Réveil published in 1851.&lt;ref name="Condon_78"/&gt;

A second version (1819; now at the [[château de Pau]])&lt;ref name="chateau-pau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chateau-pau.fr/objet/don-pedro-de-tolede-baisant-lepee-dhenri-iv|title=Don Pedro de Tolède baisant l&amp;#039;épée d&amp;#039;Henri IV &amp;#124; Château de Pau|publisher=chateau-pau.fr|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was painted for Ingres' friend, the artist Jean Alaux.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; It closely replicates the initial composition of the 1814 version: In the background at the left stands a guard; an unidentified figure is exiting at the right. This version was displayed in the 2014 ''L'invention du Passé. Histoires de cœur et d'épée 1802–1850'' exhibition at the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]].

In the third painting (1820; acquired for the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] in 2009),&lt;ref name="latribunedelart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribunedelart.com/premieres-acquisitions-du-louvre-abou-dhabi|title=Premières acquisitions du Louvre-Abou Dhabi - La Tribune de l'Art|publisher=latribunedelart.com|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingres moved the row of caryatids from the left edge of the composition to the center, and reversed the angle of the perspective.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; The figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées are once again in the background at the left. The painting was previously in a private collection in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name="gouv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_98=REF&amp;VALUE_98=00000060300|title=Joconde - catalogue - dictionnaires|publisher=culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth version (1832; acquired by the [[Louvre Museum]] in 1981)&lt;ref name="Condon_80-81"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. pp. 80–81. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is slightly smaller than the others. The setting is changed from the Salle des Caryatides to the Stairway of Henri II, and the number of onlookers is augmented by the inclusion of the poet [[François de Malherbe]], Cardinal [[Jacques Davy Duperron]], and an unidentified man.&lt;ref name="Condon_80-81"/&gt;

The '''National Emblem of the [[Togo|Togolese Republic]]''' was adopted on 14 March 1962.

In the device, there are two red [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] to be seen, which symbolize the bravery of the people.  The bow and arrow call for all citizens to be active in the [[Civil defense|defense]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of the country.  Between the lions is a golden shield with the letters '''RT''' (République Togolaise) to be seen.  Above the [[flag of Togo]] is displayed twice.  On the ribbon stands "Travail, Liberté, Patrie" (Work, Liberty, Homeland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,TGO,456d621e2,48ef43c72,0.html Togolese constitution (1992) at UNHCR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanlegislaturesproject.org/content/constitution-togo Togolese constitution (2002) at African Legislatures Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214090412/http://www.africanlegislaturesproject.org/content/constitution-togo |date=2012-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the German government decided to assign coats of arms to its overseas colonies, including Togoland.  Arms were designed, but [[World War I]] broke out before the project was  finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion. The arms proposed for [[Togoland|the Protectorate of Togoland]] depicted a tree supported by two cobra snakes and the German imperial eagle on a chief. The eagle and the imperial crown on the shield was the same for all the proposed colonial arms.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Schurdel, H.D. . Battenberg (1995).

'''Ethnopoetics''' is a method of recording text versions of [[oral poetry]] or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic [[line (poetry)|lines]], [[verse (poetry)|verses]], and [[stanza]]s (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include [[Jerome Rothenberg]], [[Dennis Tedlock]], and [[Dell Hymes]]. Ethnopoetics is considered  a subfield of [[ethnology]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[linguistics]], and [[Literary criticism|literature]] and translation studies.

==A need for ethnopoetics: Rothenberg==
Jerome Rothenberg  coined the term ethnopoetics in the 1960s. According to Catherine S. Quick, Rothenberg had recognized that “most translations of Native American oral traditions . . . failed to capture the power and beauty of the oral performances on the written page,” especially when “Western poetic styles” were imposed upon these written texts (1999, 96).&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;Quick, Catherine. 1999. "Ethnopoetics." ''Folklore Forum'' 30(1/2): 95–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg’s influence has increased public [[awareness]] of the rich narrative and poetic traditions of cultures all over the world.

==Ethnopoetic theory: Tedlock and Hymes==
The development of ethnopoetics as a separate subfield of study was largely pioneered from the middle of the 20th century by anthropologists and linguists such as Dennis Tedlock and Dell Hymes. Both Tedlock and Hymes used ethnopoetic analysis to do justice to the artistic richness of Native American verbal art, and while they have disagreed on some analytic details, they agree on the fundamental issues and purposes of ethnopoetics.

===Dennis Tedlock===
On the one hand, Dennis Tedlock argues not only that pauses in oral performances indicate where poetic line breaks should occur in the written texts, which he compares to musical scores,&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; but also that words on the page should be formatted to reflect the more subtle qualities of speech used in oral performances. Tedlock explain his perspective in this way,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;An ethnopoetic score [or text] not only takes account of the words but silences, changes in loudness and tone of voice, the production of sound effects, and the use of gestures and props. . . . Ethnopoetics remains open to the creative side of performance, valuing features that may be rare or even unique to a particular artist or occasion.&lt;ref name="Tedlock"&gt;Tedlock, Dennis. Syllabus. “English 699: Ethnopoetics.” Colleges of Arts and Sciences. University at Buffalo. Accessed 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Tedlock argues that by visually representing oral performance features in the written texts, ethnopoetic methods more accurately convey the aesthetic qualities of the performance than uniformly formatted text in prose paragraphs ever could. Tedlock himself defines ethnopoetics as “a decentered poetics, an attempt to hear and read the poetries of distant others, outside the Western [poetic] tradition as we know it now."&lt;ref name="Tedlock"/&gt;

===Dell Hymes===
On the other hand, Dell Hymes believes that even previously dictated texts retain significant structural patterns of poetic repetition that “are the ‘reason why’” storytellers use pauses in their oral performances (1999, 97–98).&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; Hymes’s ethnopoetic theories focus on repetitions in the grammar and syntax of transcribed and translated texts that he suggest can still be analyzed and retranslated. For example, accordingly to folklorist [[Barre Toelken]], the poetic beauty and power of Native American texts like “The Sun's Myth” have been restored “because a dedicated anthropological folklorist and linguist, Dell Hymes, dedicated a good part of his life to resuscitating a dry, written text collected . . . by a long-dead anthropologist [i.e., Franz Boas] and stored away in a dusty volume” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt;Toelken, Barre. 2003. The Anguish of Snails. Vol. 2, Folklife of the West, edited by [[Barre Toelken]] and William A. Wilson. Logan: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Hymes retranslated “The Sun’s Myth,” he recovered the poetic and stylistic devices that were used in the original recorded performance, but which had been lost in the myth’s earlier translation by [[Franz Boas]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hymes’ ethnopoetics revolves around a conception of narratives as primarily organized in terms of ''formal'' and ''aesthetic''—‘poetic’—patterns, not in terms of content or thematic patterns. Narrative is therefore to be seen as a form of action, of performance, and the meanings it generates are effects of performance. Narratives, seen from this perspective, are organized in lines and in groups of lines (verses, stanzas), and the organization of lines in narratives is a kind of implicit patterning that creates narrative effect. . . . Content, in other words, is an effect of the formal organization of a narrative: What there is to be told emerges out of how it is being told. (Blommaert 2007, 216)&lt;ref name="Blommaert"&gt;Blommaert, Jan. 2007. “Applied Ethnopoetics.” Narrative–State of the Art. Edited by Michael G. W. Bamberg. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. Benjamins Current Topics Series (Number: 595215). 215–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, understanding the native language of oral performers is essential for accurate, ethnopoetic translation of their words into written texts. For example, folklorist Barre Toelken explains that Hymes’s “knowledge of the extant Chinookan languages” helped him to “notice stylistic devices that highlighted certain actions and themes and even performance styles that brought scenes into sharp focus” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"/&gt; In other words, without his knowledge of the native language of oral performers, Hymes could not have placed his ethnopoetic translation of “The Sun’s Myth” within its specific Native American cultural context.

==Ethnopoetics: aesthetic movement or academic discipline?==
Various other writers and poets can be said to have contributed to the field of ethnopoetics as an aesthetic movement. For example, Tristan Tzara created [[calligrams]] and [[William Bright]] worked with the Karuk tribe to preserve their native language. However, within the fields of [[linguistics]], [[folkloristics]], and [[anthropology]], ethnopoetics refers to a particular method of analyzing the linguistic features and syntactical structures of [[oral literature]] (such as poetry, myths, narratives, folk tales, ceremonial speeches, etc.) in ways that pay attention to poetic patterns within speech. Overall, then, ethnopoetic methods and theories strive to capture on the written page the unique aesthetic elements of individual cultures’ oral poetry and narrative performance traditions, or what folklorists would call their verbal lore.

The '''flag of the Faroe Islands''' is an offset cross, representing [[Christianity]]. It is similar in design to other [[Nordic Cross|Nordic flags]] – a tradition set by the ''[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]]'' of Denmark,&lt;ref name="Andrew Evans"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GfdBAASUQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=iceland+flag+christianity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3YNGTbOfNML98AaumrzkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iceland%20flag%20christianity&amp;f=false|author=Andrew Evans|title=Iceland|publisher=Bradt|quote=Legend states that a red cloth with the white cross simply fell from the sky in the middle of the 13th-century Battle of Valdemar, after which the Danes were victorious.

The flag is called '''''Merkið''''', which means "the banner" or "the mark". It resembles the flags of neighbouring [[Flag of Norway|Norway]] and [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]].

==Description and symbolism==
The design of the flag incorporates a red [[Nordic cross]], which is offset to the left. The red cross is [[Fimbriation|fimbriated]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] and is set on a white field. The flag design closely resembles that of the [[Flag of Norway|Norwegian flag]], with the fimbriated cross. The flag proportion is usually 5:7.

White symbolises the creators of the flag, the foam of the sea and the pure, radiant sky of the Faroe Islands, while the old Faroese blue and red colours are reminiscent of other Scandinavian and Nordic flags; representing the Faroe Islands' bonds with other Nordic countries.&lt;ref name=SN&gt;Smith/Neubecker: Wappen und Flaggen aller Nationen. München 1981; {{ISBN|3-87045-183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern Faroese flag was devised in 1919 by [[Jens Oliver Lisberg]] and others while they were studying in [[Copenhagen]]. The first time Merkið was raised in the Faroe Islands was on 22 June that year in [[Fámjin]] on the occasion of a wedding. On 25 April, 1940, the [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|British occupation government]] approved the flag for use by Faroese vessels, during the tenure of [[Carl Aage Hilbert]] as Danish prefect. Britain did not want the same flag as German-occupied Denmark to be used. April 25 is still celebrated as '''Flaggdagur''' and it is a national holiday. With the Home Rule Act of 23 March, 1948, the flag was recognized by the [[Denmark|Danish Government]] as the national flag of the Faroes. The original flag is displayed in the church of [[Fámjin]] in [[Suðuroy]].

[[File:Budgen portraithead.jpg|thumb|Plaster head by August Suter (1927), August-Suter-Museum, Eptingen]]
'''Frank Spencer Curtis Budgen''' (1 March 1882 – 26 April 1971) was an English [[Painting|painter]], writer and socialist activist acquainted with the author [[James Joyce]].

==Life==
Born in [[Crowhurst, Surrey|Crowhurst]], [[Surrey]], Budgen spent six years at sea before working in [[London]] as a postal worker. He changed jobs a number of times before travelling to [[Paris]] in 1910 to study painting. He supported himself there by working as a model for the Swiss sculptor [[August Suter (sculptor)|August Suter]] (1887-1965)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jjon.org/jioyce-s-people/suter jjon.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and became acquainted with the French writer [[Blaise Cendrars]] and the Swiss poet and translator [[:de:Siegfried Lang|Siegfried Lang]]. At the invitation of August Suter he moved to Switzerland shortly before [[World War I]]. Here he was employed by the British government at the Ministry of Information, an institution established in [[Zürich]] for "the spread of British propaganda in neutral countries."  He returned to London after the war, where he remained until his death. Budgen was a member of the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]] and eventually its general secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/challinor/1977/british-bolshevism/ch05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He translated and published the first cheap edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' with Lily G. Aitken.&lt;ref&gt;The Socialist Labour Press, Glasgow, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Budgen never lost contact with his Swiss friends and paid several visits to Switzerland to meet August and Paul Suter as well as Siegfried Lang. He was a guest of honour at the first James-Joyce-Symposium in Dublin in 1967.

Frank Budgen was married to Francine Budgen (11 June 1896 – 16 April 1977) with daughter Joan.&lt;ref&gt;''A Wake Newslitter'', New Series, Vol. IX, Nr. 1, February 1972, "Frank Budgen Issue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne F. Cooper, ''Claude McKay: rebel sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance: a biography'', Schocken Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce and Budgen spent much of the war in the same city, Zurich, and similar social circles of artists,&lt;ref&gt;There is a [http://www.joycefoundation.ch/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BudgenWeb.jpg statue of Frank Budgen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160125/http://www.joycefoundation.ch/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BudgenWeb.jpg |date=2014-07-14 }} by his sculptor friend August Suter on Uraniastrasse 9&lt;/ref&gt; writers and musicians. According to Budgen's 1934 memoir ''James Joyce and the Making of Ulysses'', Joyce regularly discussed aesthetic matters with him, often referring to the content of Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', ''Ulysses'' and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. The last of these three, Budgen stated, Joyce referred to at the time as ''Work in Progress''; indeed a number of the conversations he reports as having had with Joyce imply that the author was working out the form and content of this work in part by arguing with Budgen.

Joyce scholar Clive Hart wrote about him:&lt;blockquote&gt;One of Budgen's many fine qualities was a gift for making new friendships with people of all ages. Although he used occasionally to grumble about the unfortunate effects of technological progress on the quality of life in London and elsewhere, he never failed, even in his last years, to welcome new life, new experience. In his thirties, when he and Joyce were closest, Budgen must have been a most stimulating companion. Even in his eighties he was an excellent man at a party, enjoying the company of people of all kinds, being lionized by many of the men and by virtually all of the women, talking with zest, listening (as few people do) with equal zest. It was when he was in the company of a number of his friends that one saw most clearly the vigorous, intelligent, endlessly curious man whom Joyce had known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Clive|title=Introduction|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/JoyceColl/JoyceColl-idx?type=turn&amp;id=JoyceColl.BudgenUlysses&amp;entity=JoyceColl.BudgenUlysses.p0008&amp;isize=text|work=James Joyce and the Making of "Ulysses"|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Frank and Francine Budgen are buried at the graveyard of St George’s Church, Crowhurst, Surrey.

[[Image:Taiwan-Puppet-Monkey-god2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sun Wukong]] puppet in pò·-tē-hì.]]
'''Glove puppetry''' ({{zh|poj=pò͘-tē-hì|t=布袋戲|p=bùdàixì}})&lt;ref&gt;Also known as '''budai mu'ouxi''', '''shoucao kuileixi''', '''shoudai kuileixi''', '''chang-chung hsi''' ([[pinyin]]: zhǎngzhōngxì), '''xiaolong''', or '''zhihuaxi'''&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of opera using cloth [[puppet]]s that originated during the 17th century in [[Quanzhou]] or [[Zhangzhou]] of [[China]]'s [[Fujian]] province, and historically practised in the [[Min Nan]]-speaking areas such as Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, the [[Chaoshan]] region of [[Guangdong]], and other parts of southern China. It had since established itself contemporarily as a popular art form in [[Taiwan]].

The puppet's head uses wood carved into the shape of a hollow human head, but aside from the head, palms, and feet, which are made of wood, the puppet's [[torso]] and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. At the time of the performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and makes it perform. In previous years the puppets used in this type of performance strongly resembled "cloth sacks," hence the name, which literally means "cloth bag opera."

==Glove puppetry performances==
[[File:Handrama doll BlueButterfly.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern style of puppet in Taiwan glove puppetry.]]
Glove puppetry (pò͘-tē-hì) performances, similar to some types of [[Chinese opera]], are divided into a first half and a second half show. During the first half, known as the "show platform" (戲台), the audience is shown a demonstration by a master puppeteer on the stage. The second half consists of the puppet master, the orchestra, and the spoken parts. Several key points of a show to be appreciated include: the dexterity of the master puppeteer's manipulation of the puppet, the accompaniment of the orchestra, and the poetic spoken parts of the [[voice actors]]. With few exceptions, from traditional pò͘-tē-hì to modern performances, human vocal music and operatic singing is rarely heard.

==Glove puppetry in Indonesia==
[[File:Sie Djien Koei Potehi.JPG|thumb|right|Wayang Potehi of Indonesia]]
In Indonesia, glove puppetry once popular throughout Chinese communities around Sumatra and Java. Especially in Java, the acculturation between Chinese and Javanese culture gave birth to new style of puppetry, called ''[[Peranakan]] Potehi''.&lt;ref name="wayangpotehi1"&gt;[http://thejakartapostimages.weebly.com/photostory/potehi Potehi puppets bring celebratory mood], ''thejakartapostimages''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wayangpotehi2"&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/07/14/in-praise-puppets.html In praise of puppets], ''thejakartapost''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Today, glove puppetry is called with the term "[[Wayang]] Potehi" (Wayang means "puppet" in Javanese). The Wayang Potehi tradition is mainly preserved in [[Central Java]] ([[Semarang]]) and [[East Java]]'s ({{ill|Gudo, Jombang|id}}) Chinese communities.&lt;ref name="gudo potehi"&gt;{{id}}[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2014/10/02/194100427Seni.Wayang.Potehi.Berpusat.di.Gudo Seni Wayang Potehi Berpusat di Gudo (Center of Wayang Potehi in Gudo)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''travel.kompas.com''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the dialog parts of Wayang Potehi have been narrated using Indonesian and [[Javanese language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6819">'''Human-centered design''' ('''HCD''') [also '''Human-centred design''', as used in ISO standards] is a design and management framework that develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process. Human involvement typically takes place in observing the problem within context, brainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and implementing the solution.

''Human-centred design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, usability knowledge, and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.'' ISO 9241-210:2010(E)

Human-centered design builds upon [[participatory action research]] by moving beyond participants' involvement and producing solutions to problems rather than solely documenting them. Initial stages usually revolve around immersion, observing, and contextual framing in which innovators immerse themselves with the problem and community. Consequent stages may then focus on community brainstorming, modeling and prototyping, and implementation in community spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Innovating for people: Handbook of human-centered design methods. (2012). Pittsburgh, PA: LUMA Institute, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, human-centered design typically focuses on integrating technology or other useful tools in order to alleviate problems, especially around issues of health.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, G. O., Pacione, C., Shultz, R. K., &amp; Klügl, M. (2015). Leveraging human-centered design in chronic disease prevention. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 48''(4), 472-479.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the solution is integrated, human-centered design usually employ system usability scales and community feedback in order to determine the success of the solution.

== Rationale for adoption ==


Using a human-centered approach to design and development has substantial economic and social benefits for users, employers and suppliers. Highly usable systems and products tend to be more successful both
technically and commercially. In some areas, such as consumer products, purchasers will pay a premium for well-designed products and systems. Support and help-desk costs are reduced when users can understand
and use products without additional assistance. In most countries, employers and suppliers have legal obligations to protect users from risks to their health, and safety and human-centered methods can reduce these risks (e.g. musculoskeletal risks). Systems designed using human-centered methods improve quality, for example, by:
* increasing the productivity of users and the operational efficiency of organizations;
* being easier to understand and use, thus reducing training and support costs;
* increasing usability for people with a wider range of capabilities and thus increasing accessibility;
* improving user experience;
* reducing discomfort and stress;
* providing a competitive advantage, for example by improving brand image;
* contributing towards sustainability objectives

Human-centered design may be utilized in multiple fields, including sociological sciences and technology. It has been noted for its ability to consider human dignity, access, and ability roles when developing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, R. (2001). Human dignity and human rights: Thoughts on the principles of human-centered design. ''Design issues, 17''(3), 35-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, human-centered design may more fully incorporate culturally sound, human-informed, and appropriate solutions to problems in a variety of fields rather than solely product and technology-based fields. Typically, human-centered design is more focused on  "methodologies and techniques for interacting with people in such a manner as to facilitate the detection of meanings, desires and needs, either by verbal or non-verbal means."&lt;ref&gt;Giacomin, J. (2014). ''What Is Human Centered Design? The Design Journal, 17''(4), 606-623.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[user-centered design]] is another approach and framework of processes which considers the human role in product use, but focuses largely on the production of interactive technology designed around the user's physical attributes rather than social problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Abras, C., Maloney-Krichmar, D., &amp; Preece, J. (2004). User-centered design. Bainbridge, W. Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 37(4), 445-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stanford d.school at [[Stanford University]] is a large proponent of human-centered design and teaches innovative approaches to human problems by focusing on empathy-informed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques==

Human-centered design has been both lauded and criticised for its ability to actively problem solve with affected communities. Criticisms include the inability of human-centered design to push the boundaries of available technology by solely tailoring to the demands of present-day solutions, rather than focus on possible future solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/human-centered.html|title=Human-Centered Design Considered Harmful - jnd.org|website=www.jnd.org|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, human-centered design often considers context, but does not offer tailored approaches for very specific groups of people. New research on innovative approaches include youth-centered health design, which focuses on youth as the central aspect with particular needs and limitations not always addressed by human-centered design approaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://yth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">'''Ideal town''' was a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] concept developed by Italian [[polymath]] [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404{{ndash}}1472), author of ten books of treatises on modern architecture  titled ''De Re Aedificatoria'' written about 1450 with additions made until the time of his death in 1472. Alberti's architectural theories concerned the planning and building of an entire town as opposed to individual [[edifice]]s for private patrons or ecclesiastical purposes. 
[[File:Braun and Hogenberg Zamość.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamość]] in the 17th century]]
Alberti insisted on choosing the location of the town first, followed by careful setting up of the size and direction of streets, then location of bridges and gates, and finally a building pattern ruled by perfect symmetry.&lt;ref name="Blunt"&gt;Anthony Blunt, [http://www.nehawu.org.za/images/18023,%20Anthony%20Blunt,%20Alberti,%201959,%20and%20Spinoza.pdf  From "Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450‐1660". Chapter 1: Alberti.] PDF file, direct download 192 KB. NEHAWU Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent examples of a town modelled on this theory was [[Zamość]] founded in the 16th century by the chancellor [[Jan Zamoyski]]. At present, it is a [[List of World Heritage Sites of Poland|World Heritage Site]] in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/564  Old City of Zamość.] UNESCO World Heritage Centre 2014, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ideal town was seen as a utopia to be achieved by disregarding the reasonably regular planimetrics of real, historic towns for standards – geometric, aesthetic or otherwise – of ideal perfection. Therefore the debate about ideal towns has become isolated from the debate about real, historic towns. In fact, there has often been the temptation to superimpose and identify this debate with one about utopia and those town models often linked to the utopian concept. &lt;ref name="Educativo"&gt;[http://win.liceogalilei.org/deure/Comenius/Intro-CdRomEng.html  European Educational Project: ''What city for man.''] Progetto Educativo Europeo

'''Kappazuri''', also known as '''kappa-zuri''', '''kappazuri-e''', and as '''katagamizuri-e''', are [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese prints]] printed in a single color (usually black) from [[woodblocks]] and then colored by [[stenciling]].  Prints produced entirely by [[stenciling]], without woodblocks, are also called '''kappazuri'''.  Kappazuri may be identified by the presence of visible brushstrokes, unevenness of color, pooling of ink at the margins of the stencil cutouts, and gaps or overlaps between colored areas and black outlines.

Although also produced in Edo (Tokyo), Kappazuri are more closely associated with prints from [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]].  The most prolific designer of Kappazuri was [[Urakusai Nagahide]], and the most abundant examples are his depictions of the annual costume parade in the [[Gion]] district of [[Kyoto]].

This is a list of living actors from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. These are actors who are still living and had a credited role in at least one Hollywood film between the end of the silent era in 1927/1929 and 1959, the acknowledged end of the Golden Age. Entries are from oldest to youngest. Actors are listed with the year of their Hollywood debut, along with any films they had credited roles in (a maximum of seven) which are now considered classics. Films listed include those produced after ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', the 1948 federal case considered the first "nail in the coffin" of the studio system, up to the near-bankruptcy of many major studios in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7933">'''Lyrical dance''' has been defined as a dance style that embodies various aspects of [[ballet]], [[jazz]], [[acrobatics]], [[Modern dance|modern]], and [[hip hop]], while still maintaining its autonomy. According to Jennifer Foster, “It has been strongly associated with clearly displayed emotional moods, fast-moving choreographic strategies, emphasis on virtuosic display, illustration of song lyrics, and, in group form, exact unison.” &lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=Jennifer |title=When Good Adjective Go Bad: The Case of the So-called Lyrical Dance |journal=Dance Chronicle |date=23 Oct 2014 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=312-334 |doi=10.1080/01472526.2014.958650 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01472526.2014.958650 |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is usually danced at a faster pace than ballet but not as fast as jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-lyrical-dance-1007414|title=What Is the Lyrical Dance Style?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;The term “lyrical” dance has been recorded as being used only in the realm of dance competitions, and briefly on the popular television show [[So You Think You Can Dance]] (SYTYCD). &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=Defining Dance, Creating Commodity: The Rhetoric of So You Think You Can Dance |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Dance and the Popular Screen |date=Oct 2014 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199897827.013.021 |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199897827.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199897827-e-021?rskey=MFSNAU&amp;result=1#oxfordhb-9780199897827-e-021-bibliography-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The history of lyrical dance has not been as clearly documented as other styles of dance. There is little research and documentation of the origins of lyrical dance most likely due to the limited use of this style outside of the competition dance world.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; There are three popular origin stories for lyrical dance that have been suggested by experts of competition dance. The first, speculated by Jimmy Peters, is that lyrical dance evolved from the “dream ballet” in musicals such as Oklahoma and West Side Story. The second from Chelya Clawson, states that this term can be traced back to 16th century traditional Indian dance. The last, and the most plausible, created by Phyllis Balanga- Demoret, is that it began about 25 years ago as a result of ballet’s inability to take to the competition stage.&lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there has been no official documentation, Balanga-Demoret’s explanation is the most plausible because lyrical dance is only used in competition dance. Additionally, ballet is rarely seen on a competitive stage, despite it having its own category at many competitions, which further confirms Balanga- Demoret’s theory.
Dancer, teacher, and choreographer Suzi Taylor, who holds regular classes at Steps on Broadway in [[New York City]], is considered by many to be an early mother of lyrical dance, having emphasized a unique brand of musicality and expressiveness which influenced many future teachers and choreographers.&lt;ref&gt;''Matisse Dance with Joy''by Susan Goldman Rubin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dance Teacher, The Practical Magazine of Dance''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jen. "America'S Sweetheart." Dance Spirit 13.9 (2009): 64-68. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 31 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The styles within lyrical dance have changed overtime. In the earlier stages, a dancer would perform the lyrics of a song, displaying emotions. Today, the lyrical category still has an emphasis on displaying emotion but in a more abstract way. The lyrical category is a place for innovation and stylized movement that is associated with contemporary dance. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical dancing is performed to music with lyrics to inspire movements to express strong feelings and emotions the choreographer feels from the lyrics in the chosen song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.about.com/od/typesofdance/f/Lyrical_Dance.htm/ What is Lyrical Dance? --About.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124738/http://dance.about.com/od/typesofdance/f/Lyrical_Dance.htm |date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because lyrical dancing focuses on the expression of strong emotion, the style concentrates more on individual approach and expressiveness than the precision of the dancer's movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing/ Lyrical Dancing --lovetoknow.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403192724/http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing |date=2015-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there is not as much focus on the choreography, and, in fact, the choreography often exists only as a general guide for the dancer, not as a routine that has to be exactly followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-lyrical-dance-1007414|title=What Is the Lyrical Dance Style?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Style vs Technique'''

Because of the links between the styles of dance, teachers originally struggled with whether to teach lyrical dance alongside jazz or ballet or as its own, separate style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-dancers-amoung-us.weebly.com/history-of-lyrical-and-contemporary.html|title=History of Lyrical and Contemporary|website=The History Of Dance|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concerns with lyrical dance is the distinction between lyrical as a style and/or a technique. Lyrical has been described  as a “pseudostyle” or a “pseudogenre” &lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;because it utilizes steps from other, more established styles of dance. Lyrical dance utilizes training from jazz technique, ballet technique, and modern technique as a basis for movement. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisbrod |first1=Alexis |title=dance: Redefining Dance in the United States |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6924g6c6 |website=UC Riverside |publisher=eScholarship |accessdate=23 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These well-known movements are elongated, taken off their center, and distorted to create a new aesthetic in lyrical. Although advertised by some studios as a class, “lyrical technique” does not technically exist. A dancer cannot be proficient in lyrical dance without knowledge and mastery of basic technique from jazz, ballet, and modern. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1" /&gt;


'''Use in Popular Culture'''

Lyrical dance is competition dance jargon and is only used to describe a specific style of dance in the world of competitive dance. “Lyrical” is used to describe a quality or movement type in other dance settings, but not as a style name such as Jazz or Ballet. There has only been one instance of lyrical being used in a professional setting. This was on Season 1 of the popular American dance show So You Think You Can Dance. Contestants on this reality show were asked to compete in many different styles such as ballroom, hip-hop, jazz, and lyrical. The term lyrical was replaced by the term contemporary in Season 2 of the show. This was thought to have been done to professionally legitimize this show. Despite the name change, the type of dances performed in this style remain very similar. &lt;ref name="Weisbrod 1" /&gt;

'''Michael Dickinson''' (born 1950, [[Durham, England|Durham]]) is an English artist known for his work in Turkey, who works with political and satirical [[collage]]s. In 2008, he was prosecuted for a collage of the Turkish prime minister, but acquitted.&lt;ref name=tait&gt;Tait, Robert. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/turkey.humanrights "Turkish court acquits British artist over portraying PM as US poodle"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 September 2008. Retrieved 26 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the international [[art movement]] [[Stuckism]].&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

==Life and work==
Michael Dickinson was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, and spent most of his early years in [[Kuwait]], where his father was an employee of the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] and where he attended the Anglo-American School.&lt;ref name=timessatire&gt;Alberge, Dalya and Erdem, Suna (2006). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article675651.ece Satire that could land British artist in a Turkish jail], ''[[The Times]]'', 17 June 2006. Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Fyling Hall]] school in [[Yorkshire]]. He lives and works as an English teacher in Istanbul. He is the founder of the Istanbul branch of the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/world.html#Turkey "Stuckist groups"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a writer, playwright and actor.

===Collage banned by Tripod===

In May 2005, Dickinson's web site, "The Carnival of Chaos", was blanked and he was informed by the host Tripod (a member of the [[Lycos]] group), "You are no longer an authorized member of Tripod. You have been removed because your web site violated our Terms of Service."&lt;ref name=banned&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Index.html "The Carnival of Chaos banned"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after he had posted a collage, ''Tyrant's Pants'', showing President Bush in his underpants with a cruise missile coming out of his rear and a [[swastika]] on his right buttock.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

[[File:Tyrant's-Pants.jpg|thumb|upright|''Tyrant's Pants'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing President Bush]]
The collage was a response to a photo which had appeared with the headline "Tyrant's in his pants" on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', showing captive [[Saddam Hussein]] in underpants.&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

===Turkish court case===

In June 2006, [[Istanbul]] police removed one of Dickinson's collages from a show in the city organised by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; Dickinson states that he hung his work in the show unknown to the organisers.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton&gt;Birch, Nicholas.

Bush|President Bush]] in a pet show.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; 
He was informed by Turkish authorities that he would be prosecuted for "insulting the Prime Minister's dignity"; the charge carries a sentence of one to three years.&lt;ref name=blairasked&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2220955,00.html "Blair asked to help artist facing jail"] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 11 June 2006.

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Best in Show.jpg|thumb|left|''Best in Show'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing Turkish Prime Minister [[Tayyip Erdoğan]] as a dog given a rosette by US President George Bush]]
''[[The Times]]'' said: "The case could greatly embarrass Turkey and Britain, for it raises questions about Turkey’s human rights record as it seeks EU membership, with Tony Blair’s backing."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], co-founder of the Stuckist movement, wrote to British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] asking for his intervention:&lt;ref name=vatan&gt;[http://www.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=haberdetay&amp;tarih=12.06.2006&amp;Newsid=79736&amp;Categoryid=7 "Erdoğan'ı kızdıran kolaj için Blair devreye girdi"] ''Vatan'' (in Turkish) online, 12 June 2006. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is intolerable that a country applying for EU membership should censor freedom of political comment in this way. I trust you will communicate your strongest condemnation and ask for this case to be abandoned immediately. I ask for your assurance that you will oppose Turkish EU membership in the strongest terms, until Turkey adopts the attitudes of the civilised world towards human rights."&lt;ref name=stuckistartist&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Turkey.html "Blair asked to intervene as Stuckist artist faces 3 years jail in Turkey for this collage"] stuckism.com. Retrieved 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson said:
"It’s such an Alice in Wonderland feeling. The law is so absurd ... This law exists in Turkey about insulting 'Turkishness' or the State. You’re not allowed to state your opinion."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt;

In September 2006, Dickinson attended the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of the Global Peace and Justice Coalition show, charged with insulting behaviour for exhibiting Dickinson's work. The prosecutor described Dickinson as "ill-intentioned", but declined to bring a case because of "lack of evidence".&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; Hasan Gungor of the Istanbul-based group,  Initiative for Freedom of Speech, attributed this to fear of international news, when the [[European Union]] has concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt;

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Good Boy.jpg|thumb|''Good Boy'' by Michael Dickinson. He was prosecuted for its display.]]
Members of Global Peace and Justic Coalition remonstrated with Dickinson for distracting attention from their anti-[[Iraq War]] cause, and he then held up another collage showing Erdogan as a dog with a lead of the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]; he was arrested and charged with insulting the Turkish prime minister's dignity&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; with a trial date scheduled for October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Oliver.

Retrieved 2 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Dickinson's collages were displayed at the [[A Gallery]], London, in the Stuckist show ''I Won't Have Sex with You as long as We're Married''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/AGalleryJuly07/IndexShow.html "I won't have sex with you as long as we're married"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 2 September 2007. Photos of the collages in the A Gallery show.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2008, he was acquitted of any crime, the judge ruling that although there were "some insulting elements" in his collage, it fell "within the limits of criticism".&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; The case has favourable implications for Turkey's relationship with the [[European Union]], which had called for an improvement of its human rights record.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; Dickinson said, "I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions."&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

In June 2009, Dickinson fled Turkey for his native country, Britain, after learning that his acquittal had been overturned. Unable to find work, he returned to Istanbul soon after. In January 2010, a Turkish court convicted Dickinson of mocking the Turkish prime minister and levied a fine.   Refusing to pay the fine as a matter of principle, Dickinson faces up to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/8483479.stm "Artist fined for art mocking Turkey's prime minister"], 27 January 2010. Retrieved 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His final sentencing will occur at a trial on 9 March 2010.

Dickinson's application for a residence permit was refused due to his 2010 conviction, but he remained in the country after the expiry of his tourist visa. He was arrested in October 2013 for shouting [[Gezi Park]]-related slogans at police, and detained after his expired visa was discovered. He was deported after some days (and banned from returning for five years), choosing to go to Barcelona rather than his native Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickinson, ''CounterPunch'', 1 November 2013, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/01/tossed-out-of-turkey-after-twenty-seven-years/ Tossed Out Of Turkey After Twenty Seven Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moonrise by the Sea''''' or '''''Moonrise over the Sea''''' (German: ''Mondaufgang am Meer'') is an 1822 oil-on-canvas painting by German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].  The work depicts a [[Romanticism|romantic]] seascape.  

Three young people, two women side by side and a man further back, are sitting on a large boulder by the sea, silhouetted against the sky as they watch the moon rising to the east above a band of clouds.  In the distance are two sailing vessels, ghosting on a light breeze towards the spectators on the shore.  The painting is probably a view of the [[Baltic Sea]], near Friedrich's birthplace in [[Swedish Pomerania]].  It may be based on the beach at [[Stubbenkammer]] near [[Rügen]].

The work was commissioned by banker and art collector [[Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener]], together with a second work, ''[[The Lonely Tree]]'' (''Der einsame Baum''), to create a pair of "times of the day", depicting morning and evening landscape scenes, in a tradition of [[Claude Lorrain]].  It was completed before November 1822 and has been held by the [[Berlin National Gallery]] since 1861, donated by Wagener as part of its founding collection.  It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] of the [[Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin.

A similarly named but much larger painting from 1821 has been held by the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg since 1928, and was formerly in the {{ill|Ropsha Palace|de|Ropscha-Palast|fr|Palais de Ropcha}}, and had been hung in the drawing room of [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]; it measures {{convert|137|xx|170|cm}}.

"'''Mother's Day'''", also known as the "'''Rugrats Mother's Day Special'''"{{sfn|Lenburg|2006|p=54}} or "'''Rugrats Mother's Day'''",&lt;ref name="Name2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/mothers-day-clip.html|title=Rugrats: 'Rugrats Mother's Day'|publisher=[[Nickelodeon]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116110246/http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/mothers-day-clip.html|archivedate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second episode of the fourth season of the American [[Animated series|animated]] television series ''[[Rugrats]]'' and the show's 67th episode overall. Released as a [[Mother's Day]] [[television special|special]], it revolves around the holiday from the perspective of a group of babies—[[Tommy Pickles]], [[List of Rugrats characters#Chuckie Finster|Chuckie Finster]], and [[List of Rugrats characters#Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil and Lil Deville]]. Tommy, Phil, and Lil attempt to find the perfect mother for Chuckie (who is raised only by his father [[Chaz Finster|Chaz]]) while sharing their favorite memories about their moms. At the end of the episode, Chuckie's mother is revealed to have died of a terminal illness. It concludes with Chuckie and Chaz looking through a box of her belongings, including a poem she had written for her son. Meanwhile, [[Didi Pickles]] tries to plan the perfect Mother's Day with her mom [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Minka]], while [[Betty DeVille]] helps [[Stu Pickles]] with his invention to help mothers.

Norton Virgien and Toni Vian directed the episode from a script by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, [[David N. Weiss]], Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Series co-creator [[Paul Germain]] had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] two potential storylines to explain the absence of Chuckie's mother, but  [[Nickelodeon]] executives rejected his proposed ideas that the mother was either divorced from Chaz or had died. Before "Mother's Day" premiered, only minor references to Chuckie's mother had been made. Germain left the show in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. The concept was later revised and approved as a Mother's Day special. Germain said that he was disappointed at being unable to cover the topic during his time on the series.

Broadcast on May 6, 1997, in the United States, "Mother's Day" was one of several half-hour specials that Nickelodeon commissioned for ''Rugrats''. The episode was featured on the 1998 [[VHS]] release ''Rugrats: Mommy Mania'', and was later made available for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] along with the rest of the fourth season. "Mother's Day" was praised by critics and has been the subject of several retrospective reviews for its treatment of the death of a parent. It was also praised for its positive representation of [[breastfeeding]] and expansion on the definition of motherhood. It won the [[CableACE Award]] for Writing a Children's Special or Series, and was nominated for the [[Humanitas Prize]] for the Children's Animation Category. The series received a nomination for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] for the [[49th Primetime Emmy Awards]] after Nickelodeon submitted "Mother's Day" for consideration.

==Plot==
On [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]], toddler [[Angelica Pickles]] constructs a [[macaroni]] sculpture of her head as a present to her mother, telling [[List of Rugrats characters#Main characters|the Rugrats]] the meaning of the holiday. After dropping off his son [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Chaz Finster]] gives his friend [[Didi Pickles]] a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chaz does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies [[Phil and Lil|Phil and Lil DeVille]] and [[Tommy Pickles]] look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a [[neonatal intensive care unit]]. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's dog [[Spike (Rugrats)|Spike]] and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Minka]] to a [[health spa|spa]], and [[Betty DeVille]] helps [[Stu Pickles]] with his invention to help mothers.

Angelica tasks Chuckie to pick a [[dandelion]] to decorate her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys a majority of the lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a [[spade]], a journal of [[Pressed flower craft|pressed flowers]], and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.&lt;ref name="Mother3"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Mother's Day | series=[[Rugrats]] | author=Writer: Jon Cooksey &amp; Ali Marie Matheson &amp; J.

The 23-minute and 46-second episode was written by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, [[David N. Weiss]], Susan Hood, and Ed Resto.&lt;ref name="ITunes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/rugrats-season-4/id794055092 |title=Rugrats, Season 4 |date=January 27, 2014 |publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US) |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308010058/https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/rugrats-season-4/id794055092 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; Directed by Norton Virgien and Toni Vian, it was produced by the animation studio [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Productions]], a part of [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].

[[Mark Mothersbaugh]] and [[Ruby Andrews]] contributed to the music.&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/29603-Mothers-Day |title=Mother's Day (1997) Season 4 Episode 67- Rugrats Cartoon Episode Guide |publisher=[[The Big Cartoon DataBase]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308011236/https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/29603-Mothers-Day |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, co-creator [[Paul Germain]] revealed that the concept for the episode, and the discussion about the status of Chuckie's mother, was previously [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] to [[Nickelodeon]] executives. She was not included in the first season to avoid the need to animate a completely new character. During the production of the show's second and third seasons, Germain noticed that questions about the character's absence became more prominent. He consulted with fellow co-creator Arlene Klasky, and they concluded that the only two possible ways to address the character was that she was divorced from Chaz, or had died before the series' debut.&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt;

Germain and Klasky initially planned to portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be "scary" and that "children [would not] want to see that."&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt; Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: "We mention that she exists but we don't tell you what happened to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject."&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt; Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word "dead" was never used by any of the characters.&lt;ref name="MP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/4032876 |title='90s Nostalgia: 'Rugrats' And The Tragic Story Of Melinda Finster! |last=Chapman |first=Tom |date=August 16, 2016 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308001703/https://moviepilot.com/posts/4032876 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes "[[Real or Robots?]]" (1991), "[[Chuckie vs. the Potty]]" (1992), and "[[My Friend Barney]]" (1993).&lt;ref name="Mother1"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Real or Robots? | series=[[Rugrats]] | author=Writer: Steve Viksen, Joe Ansolabehere, Patric M.

==Critical response==
In 1998, Eric Schmuckler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed to the "Mother's Day" special as an example of the show's balance between featuring an "always sunny and usually silly" tone while also being "poignant". Schmuckler described Chaz's interactions with Chuckie as "an age-appropriate version of the loss of his mother".&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/arts/television-in-rugrats-babies-know-best.html |title=Television; In 'Rugrats,' Babies Know Best |last=Schmuckler |first=Eric |date=August 30, 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308004922/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/arts/television-in-rugrats-babies-know-best.html |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rugrats'' was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] for the [[49th Primetime Emmy Awards]], after Nickelodeon submitted the special for consideration,&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; but lost to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="Winner1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/simpsons |title=Simpsons |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525153316/http://www.emmys.com/shows/simpsons |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also nominated for the [[Humanitas Prize]] for the Children's Animation Category in 1998,&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; which went to the ''[[Life with Louie]]'' episode "Blinded by Love".&lt;ref name="Winner2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanitasprize.info/HUMANITAS-NEWS-90s/1998%20July%20-%20%20HUMANITAS%20spreads%20'Good%20Will'.pdf |title=Humanitas |publisher=[[Humanitas Prize]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170405131615/http://humanitasprize.info/HUMANITAS-NEWS-90s/1998%20July%20-%20%20HUMANITAS%20spreads%20'Good%20Will'.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J.

Critics have also commented on other aspects of the episode. In 2016, Caroline Bologna from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' praised the episode for showing "a joyful depiction of [[breastfeeding]]" and for normalizing it to a wider audience. Bologna contrasted the scene with the lack of images of breastfeeding in contemporary children's television, writing that the show had a "positive legacy" and proved that "this topic was deemed perfectly suitable for a children's show 20 years ago".&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remember-when-rugrats-normalized-breastfeeding_us_57befba7e4b04193420db778 |title=Remember When 'Rugrats' Normalized Breastfeeding? |last=Bologna |first=Caroline |date=August 25, 2016 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308001525/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remember-when-rugrats-normalized-breastfeeding_us_57befba7e4b04193420db778 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Blossom of the motherhood website Romper.com also praised the scene as addressing [[reproductive health]], along with the portrayal of Tommy's premature birth and time in a neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;ref name="Romper1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/13-reasons-rugrats-was-the-most-feminist-socially-conscious-cartoon-ever-1665 |title=13 Reasons 'Rugrats' Was The Most Feminist, Socially Conscious Cartoon Ever |last=Bloom |first=Priscilla |date=November 24, 2015 |publisher=Romper.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170311000002/https://www.romper.com/p/13-reasons-rugrats-was-the-most-feminist-socially-conscious-cartoon-ever-1665 |archivedate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2013 essay "What Is a Mother?

Glazer, Lee Crespi, and David Schwartz analyzed "Mother's Day" as an extension of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Donald Winnicott]]'s theories on early childhood. They highlighted Chuckie's realization that his father acts like a mother as "a moment of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] insight" that expands the definition of motherhood.{{sfn|Drescher| Glazer|Crespi|Schwartz|2013|p=96}}

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik
|title=Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health
|publisher=Oxford University Press

|isbn=0-19-974045-3
|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P. (2011) Singular Mechanisms and Bayesian Narratives in ed. Pierre Demeulenaere, ''Analytical Sociology and Social Mechanisms'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009a"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

'''Ornit''' is the eponymous protagonist of the [[Middle High German]] [[heroic epic]] ''Ortnit''. First written down in [[strophe|strophic form]] in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it circulated in a number of distinct versions.

In the earliest version, King Ortnit sets out on an expedition to make the daughter of the heathen King Machorel his bride. He is greatly assisted by the cunning of the dwarf [[Alberich]], who can only be seen by the wearer of a magic ring, and by the martial prowess of the Russian king Ilyas, Ornit's uncle. In the second part of the story, Machorel, enraged by Ortnit's abduction of his daughter, sends him, in a feigned gesture of reconciliation, two dragon eggs. When these hatch, the dragons terrorise the land. After a year's delay, Ortnit sets out to kill the dragons, but falls asleep and is killed by them.

In most of the surviving versions, this is followed by the story of [[Wolfdietrich]], who avenges Ortnit's death and marries his widow. Though the two stories have distinct origins, they were possibly combined and integrated at an early stage. The earliest surviving versions, ''Ortnit A'' and ''Wolfdietrich A'' may be the work of a single author.

The bride-quest and dragon motifs come from older [[oral tradition]]s, but a strong [[crusade|crusading]] element in the journey to the [[Levant]] and defeat of a heathen army reflects the concerns of the 13th century. There is no consensus about the origins of the figure of Ortnit himself.

With a dozen manuscripts, six printed editions and a theatrical adaptation, the story remained popular right up until the early 17th century.

The story of Ortnit survives in eight narrative versions, grouped in four main traditions:{{sfn|Kofler|2009a|p=14}}

'''Ortnit A''' (also '''Ortnit AW''', after the two manuscripts) is the oldest version, written around 1230, containing 597 strophes.{{sfn|Kofler|2009|p=18}} A later adaptation in the Dresden Heldenbuch condenses the text to about a third of the length.{{sfn|Schenider|1931|p=XXI}}

'''Ortnit C''' survives only in two fragments containing around 60 strophes of ''Ortnit''{{sfn|Handschriftencensus|2001b}} with material close to that of Ortnit A.{{sfn|Kofler|2008|p=23}}

'''Ortnit D''', written around 1300,{{sfn|Kofler|2001|p=13}} combines material from version C and a further, unknown version.{{sfn|Schneider|1931|p=VI}} Version D survives in four different variants from the 15th and 16th centuries: 
*'''a''' 560 strophes, five manuscripts
*'''e''' 497 strophes, four manuscripts, including the manuscript version of the Strassburg Heldenbuch
*'''y''' 443 strophes, one manuscript
*'''z''' 555 strophes, the six printed editions of the Strassburg Heldenbuch.{{sfn|Kofler|2001|p=7}}

'''Wolfdietrich B''' is not accompanied by a separate ''Ortnit'' tale. Instead, the stories are integrated: Wolfdietrich meets Ortnit, defeats him in battle and gains his friendship; Ortnit later kills two giants and a dragon but is then killed in his sleep by a second dragon.{{sfn|Kofler|2008|p=17}}

==The story==
[[File:Alberich verführt die Königsmutter.jpg|thumb|Alberich seduces the Lombard queen. Woodcut from the printed [[Heldenbuch]], c. 1480.]]

===Ortnit A===
'''I.''' (Strophes 1–69) In his castle at Garda, King Ortnit of Lambarten ([[Lombardy]]) tells his vassals that he means to seek a wife, and one of them, his uncle Ilyas, King of Russia,  mentions the beautiful daughter of Machorel of Muntabur ([[Mount Tabor]]), a heathen king. In spite of the fact that Machorel kills any suitor for his daughter, intending to marry her himself once his wife is dead, Ortnit sets his heart on her.

'''II.''' (70–212) Delayed from setting out by winter weather, he is given a ring by his mother, who tells him it will lead to adventure. Following her instructions, he rides off into the wilderness until he encounters what he takes to be a child, who can only be seen by the one wearing the ring. After they have argued and fought - the child is unexpectedly strong - the child reveals himself to be the dwarf Alberich and Ortnit's natural father (having stepped in when Ortnit's parents were unable to conceive). He gives Ortnit a suit of golden armour with magical properties and vows to accompany him.

'''III.''' (213–287) Ortnit and his army set sail from [[Messina]] and, after 10 days at sea, arrive off the coast of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Machorel's capital. Alberich gives Ortnit a magic stone which allows him to speak and understand any language, and this enables him to pose as a merchant to secure permission to dock. Ortnit wants to take the city immediately, riding through the open gates, but Alberich insists this would be dishonourable. Instead, Alberich goes to Muntabur and gives Machorel a formal challenge: to give his daughter to Ortnit or be attacked. Machorel refuses and flies into a range.

'''IV.''' (288–346) That night Alberich steals hundreds of small boats from the harbour and the army uses these to land. At dawn, the alarm is given in the city and fierce fighting ensues. Alberich notices that all the city gates are open and the heathens may escape and burn the ships. Leaving Ilyas to continue the main battle, Ortnit gives chase. Returning, successful, he find that Ilyas has lost all his men, and he re-engages to avenge their deaths. With the battle over, Ilyas is shown a cellar where the remaining heathen warriors are hiding and he beheads all of them in revenge, but Ortnit prevents him from killing the woman and children. Attending to the wounded, Ortnit laments the many men he has lost.

'''V.''' (347–483) At dawn, they set off for Muntabur . On arrival they pitch their tents outside the castle, but are too close and are shot at from the ramparts. That night, however, Alberich steals into the castle and throws the bows and arrows into the moat. Believing this to be the work of the devil, the heathens pressure the queen to let Ortnit have her daughter. But the king rejects the suggestion angrily. The next day, battle is joined. Distressed at the battle and the danger to her father's life, the princess prays to [[Apollo]] and [[Mohammed]]. Alberich pretends to be a messenger from (the Christian) God but even so cannot persuade the girl to marry Ortnit, until she challenges him to proved he is stronger than her gods, whereupon he shatters her shrine and throws it into the moat. The princess relents in order to spare her father, and sends her ring to Ortnit. Battle ceases and the heathens withdraw into the castle. Alberich sneaks in and brings out the princess to Ortnit, who rides off with her. As soon as her father discovers she is missing he rides in pursuit of Ortnit with his army. In the ensuing battle, the heathen army is completely destroyed, though Machorel escapes to the safety of the castle. Ornit sets sail and, after the princess has been baptized, they marry.

'''VI.''' (484–526) Machorel is visited by a huntsman, who has stolen two eggs from a dragon's cave and offers to take them to Lombardy to hatch so that they can then devastate Ortnit's land. Machorel agrees and sends the huntsman to Lombardy with gifts. Ortnit and his wife are delighted at these signs of reconciliation. After he has shown these to Ortnit, the huntsman reveals that one gift, an elephant, must be left to grow before being given. Ortnit order the huntsman to be shown to a suitable cave in the mountains and given provisions. As the dragons grow the provision start to become inadequate and dragons start to devastate the land in their search for food. After a year, in which knights have failed to defeat the dragons, Ortnit decides that he must take on the task himself.

'''VII.''' (527–575) During an emotional parting from his wife, who tries to dissuade him, Ortnit tells her that if he fails to return, the knight who comes back with his armour, his ring and the dragon's tongue, will have avenged his death. Alberich refuses to accompany Ortnit, but warns him not to fall asleep. After a days and night wandering at random without find the dragon, he sits down to rest but is overcome by sleep. When the dragon approaches, Ortnit's hound attempts to wake him, but without success. The dragon gulps him down whole, and, returning to its lair, feeds him to its young, who suck Ortnit out through his armour.

'''VIII.''' (576–597) The hound returns to court, and the queen eventually realises that Ortnit is not following it and must be dead. This is confirmed when a vassal follows the hound to where Ortnit was killed. For two years the queen mourns and, is spite of the urging of the court, refuses to remarry unless it's to the knight who avenges Ortnit. For her refusal she is deprived of her wealth and imprisoned in a tower. The margrave takes pity on her and offers to avenge Ortnit, but only once he has a grown son to be his heir. Meanwhile he sends food and wine to her in the tower. The story concludes with the remark that we will have to wait a long time for the dragon to be killed, as the killer has not yet been born, he who will later be the grandfather of Dietrich of Verona.

===Ortnit D===
This version follows that of ''Ortnit A'' up to the point where the dragons are terrorising the country, at which point it concludes. It is followed in the manuscript and prints with the story of Hugdietrich's bride quest, which then leads into the story of Wolfdietrich, which, in this version, includes Ortnit's pursuit of the dragon and his death

After telling of Wolfdietrich's youth, the story introduces the emperor Ortnit, who is told by one of his courtiers of Hugdietrich, King of Greece, and his three sons, who do no fealty to Ortnit. Ortnit sends twelve counts to Hugdietrich to demand tribute. Although the sons threaten to resist violently any claim for tribute, Hugdietrich, in order to save lives, pays in gold. However, Wolfdietrich warns that when he is full grown he will challenge Ortnit.

After Wolfdietrich has married Sigeminne, he decides to follow up his earlier threat to challenge Ortnit. He defeats Ortnit in battle, the two are then reconciled. When Sigeminne is abducted, Ortnit offers to help and they succeed in rescuing her.

Ortnit returns home to find his land being terrorised by two dragons and two giants, Velle and his wife Runze. After killing the giants, he sets out to kill the dragons, but after he has killed the first with the help of an elephant, he mysteriously falls asleep. He wakes up to find himself being carried off by the dragon, and in spite of his attempts to resist he is smashed against a tree and killed.

==Origins==
While the earliest manuscripts of ''Ortnit'' date from the 14th century, the language of the poem suggests composition around 1230 in an [[Upper German]] dialect.{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|p=134}} The name Machorel and the castle of Muntabur seem to be borrowed from the campaign of 1217 in the [[Fifth Crusade]] against [[Al-Adil I|Sultan al-Malek al-Adel]] and his fortress at [[Mount Tabor]].{{sfn|Leinert|2015|p=150}}

Attempts to derive the story or the figure of Ortnit from Germanic myth or historical personages have not been successful.{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|p=135}}{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1972|pp=33–56}}{{sfn|Leinert|2015|p=150}}
The many German bride-quest stories, which include ''Ortnit'', [[König Rother]], [[Orendel]] and [[Solomon and Marcolf|Salman und Morolf]], have their roots in late [[Merovingian]] history: [[chronicle]]s contain a number of self-contained bride-quest stories, based ultimately on the Frankish King [[Clovis I]]'s wooing of [[Clotilde]] in 472.{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|p=2}} All involve a hero travelling to a foreign country to win a bride.{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|p=219}}

The name Ortnit is cognate with the name Hertnið shared by five different characters in the [[Þiðreks saga]], one of whom is defeated in a battle against a dragon.{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|pp=136–137}} This suggests a variety of possibly unconnected Ortnit/Hertnið stories were circulating in Northern Germany. The figure of Ortnit's uncle, Ilias, is thought to be derived from the Russian [[folk hero]] [[Ilya Muromets]].{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|p=135}} Northern Germany is the obvious location for the integration of such a character into an Ortnit story.

A parallel with the [[chanson de geste]] [[Huon of Bordeaux|Huon de Bordeaux]] has also been noted: in ''Huon'' the hero is aided by [[Oberon|Auberon]], a dwarf with supernatural powers, whose name is cognate with ''Alberich''.{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1972|pp=38–39}}

Taken together, all these suggest a geographical origin in Northwest Germany, but the story seems to have been constructed from a variety of elements, not simply retelling an "Ortnit-saga".{{sfn|Leinert|2015|p=151}} It is unclear whether the bride-quest and dragon-killing stores first became linked in the Northwest or in Southern Germany, though it seems possible that Ortnit's failure to kill the dragon was necessitated only when his story was linked with [[Wolfdietrich]].{{sfn|Bornholdt|2005|pp=138}}

==Form and structure==
''Ortnit'' and ''Wolfdietrich'' are both written in a strophic form called the ''Hildebrandston'' (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the [[Nibelungenlied]] and [[Kudrun]]). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three [[Foot (prosody)|feet]] with a [[Masculine and feminine endings|feminine ending]], a [[caesura]], then three feet with a rhymed [[Masculine rhyme|masculine ending]].{{sfn|Kofler|2009|p=14}}
{{Verse translation|
'''Ortnit A'''{{sfn|Kofler|2009a|p=29}}

There grew up in Lombardy a rich and powerful king.
In his day there was no king his equal
in all the lands of Italy. This is shown by the fact
that as long as he lived he was powerful ruler.}}
The strophes are marked in the manuscripts by a [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic capital]].

In the printed Heldenbücher, the ''Hildebrandston'' is transformed into the ''Heunenweise'', an eight-line strophe: the long-line is split at the caesura and unrhymed line-endings are given rhymes, with the resulting rhyme-scheme '''ababcdcd'''.{{sfn|Kofler|2009|p=14}} This necessarily involved considerable rewriting of the text:
{{Verse translation|

There ruled in Lombardy
A rich and noble king
In a castle called Garte
His equal was not to be found
He was called Lord Otnit
As I have heard tell
You could find in those days
No prince so praiseworthy.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="846">'''Parents for Rock and Rap''', founded in 1987 by [[Mary Morello]] in the United States, was an anti-[[censorship]] campaign which focuses on campaigning for the importance of free speech in popular music. For the work that Mary Morello put into this, she won a [[Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award]] in 1996. The campaign mainly focused on opposition to the [[Parents Music Resource Center]].

Mary Morello is also the mother of guitar player [[Tom Morello]], of [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Audioslave]], [[The Nightwatchman]] and [[Street Sweeper Social Club]].

'''Poetry''' (the term derives from a variant of the [[Greek language|Greek]] term, ''[[poiesis]]'', "making") is a form of [[literature]]  that uses [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] and rhythmic&lt;!-- Please discuss on talk page before removing or altering this word. Dictionary definitions of "poetry" tend to include, in addition to the aesthetic quality of poetry, a structural/rhythmical/metrical quality as well. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/poetry?q=poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|year=2013|postscript=—Based on the Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/poetry?s=t}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualities of [[language]]—such as [[phonaesthetics]], [[sound symbolism]], and [[metre (poetry)|metre]]—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the [[Prose|prosaic]] ostensible [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].

Poetry has a long [[history of poetry|history]], dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys &lt;ref&gt; Oral Literature in Africa, Ruth Finnegan, Open Book Publishers, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the [[Pyramid Texts]] written during the 25th century BCE, while the [[Epic of Sundiata]] is one of the most well-known examples of [[griot]] court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]] and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, [[line (poetry)|verse form]] and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, [[prose|prosaic]] forms of writing.

Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as [[assonance]], [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhythm]] are sometimes used to achieve [[music]]al or [[incantation|incantatory]] effects. The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]] and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as [[metaphor]], [[simile]] and [[metonymy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Strachan, John R|author2=Terry, Richard, G|isbn=978-0814797976|title=Poetry: an introduction|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2000|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual [[Verse (poetry)|verses]], in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some poetry types are specific to particular [[culture]]s and [[genre]]s and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Rumi]] may think of it as written in [[Line (poetry)|lines]] based on [[rhyme]] and regular [[meter (poetry)|meter]]; there are, however, traditions, such as [[Biblical poetry]], that use other means to create rhythm and [[euphony]]. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliot, TS|chapter=The Function of Criticism|title=Selected Essays|isbn=978-0151803873|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=1999|pages=13–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Longenbach, James|title=Modern Poetry After Modernism|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195101782|year=1997|pages=9, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=xxvii–xxxiii|editor=Schmidt, Michael|title=The Harvill Book of Twentieth-Century Poetry in English|publisher=Harvill Press|year=1999|isbn=1860467350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.

Other ancient [[epic poetry]] includes the [[Greek language|Greek]] epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''Odyssey''; the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] books, the ''[[Gathas|Gathic Avesta]]'' and the ''[[Yasna]]''; the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[national epic]], [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''; and the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.  Epic poetry, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Vedic period|Indian]] ''[[Vedas]]'', appears to have been composed in poetic form as an aid to memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahl, Frederick |author2=Roisman, Hannah M |title=The Odyssey Re-Formed|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1996|pages=1–26|isbn=0801483352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs. The earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of [[Chinese poetry]], the  ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', were initially lyrics.&lt;ref name="Ebrey"&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia|last=Ebrey|year=1993|title=Chinese Civilisation: A Sourcebook|edition=2nd|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0029087527|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in "[[poetics]]"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abondolo|first=Daniel|title=A poetics handbook: verbal art in the European tradition|year=2001|publisher=Curzon|isbn=9780700712236|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient societies, such as China's through her ''[[Shijing]]'' (''Classic of Poetry''), developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gentz, Joachim|title=Text and Ritual in Early China|chapter=Ritual Meaning of Textual Form: Evidence from Early Commentaries of the Historiographic and Ritual Traditions|editor=Kern, Martin|pages=124–48|isbn=978-0295987873|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Matsuo Bashō]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'', as well as differences in content spanning [[Tanakh]] [[Biblical poetry|religious poetry]], love poetry, and [[rapping|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=607–09, 620|title=A history of literary criticism|author=Habib, Rafey|isbn=978-0631232001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western traditions ===
[[File:John keats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|[[John Keats]]]]
Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Heath, Malcolm|title=Aristotle's ''Poetics''|publisher=Penguin Books |year=1997|isbn=0140446362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Aesthetics|aestheticians]] identified three major genres: epic poetry, [[lyric poetry]], and [[dramatic poetry]], treating [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]] as [[Genre|subgenres]] of dramatic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frow|first=John|title=Genre|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415280631|pages=57–59|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the [[Islamic Golden Age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogges, WF |title='Hermannus Alemannus' Latin Anthology of Arabic Poetry |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |year=1968 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=657–70 |doi=10.2307/598112 |jstor=598112}} {{cite book |author=Burnett, Charles |chapter= Learned Knowledge of Arabic Poetry, Rhymed Prose, and Didactic Verse from Petrus Alfonsi to Petrarch |title=Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=9004119647 |pages=29–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Europe during the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, Paul F |title=The Universities of the Italian Renaissance |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0801880556 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to [[prose]], which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kant, Immanuel; Bernard, JH (trans.)|title=Critique of Judgment |publisher=Macmillan|year=1914|page=131}} Kant argues that the nature of poetry as a self-consciously abstract and beautiful form raises it to the highest level among the verbal arts, with tone or music following it, and only after that the more logical and narrative prose.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[John Keats]] termed this escape from logic "[[Negative Capability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ou |first=Li |title=Keats and negative capability |year=2009 |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-1441147240 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "romantic" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watten |first=Barrett |title= The constructivist moment: from material text to cultural poetics |year=2003 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0819566102|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European [[colonialism]] and the attendant rise in global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Mahfouz, Ahmad |title=Translation as a Blending of Cultures |journal=Journal of Translation |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2008 |url= http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309034908/http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a boom in [[translation]], during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Highet |first=Gilbert |title=The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on western literature |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195002065 |pages=355, 360, 479 |edition=Reissued}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th-century and 21st-century disputes ===
[[File:Archibaldmacleish.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Archibald MacLeish]]]]
Some 20th-century [[Literary theory|literary theorists]], relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wimsatt, William K, Jr |author2=Brooks, Cleanth |title=Literary Criticism: A Short History|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1957|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some [[modernist poetry|modernist poets]] essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Jeannine|title=Why write poetry?: modern poets defending their art|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-0838641057|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-[[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] means. While there was a substantial [[New Formalism|formalist]] reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Jenkins, Lee M; Davis, Alex|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=1–7, 38, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[postmodernism]] has come to convey more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text ([[Hermeneutics]]), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roland Barthes|Barthes, Roland]]|chapter=[[Death of the author|Death of the Author]]|title=Image-Music-Text|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1978|pages=142–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Steven|title=Postmodernist culture: an introduction to theories of the contemporary|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0631200529|pages=123–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 21st century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic [[Geoffrey Hartman]] has used the phrase "the anxiety of demand" to describe contemporary response to older poetic traditions as "being fearful that the fact no longer has a form", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either "form" or "fact" could predominate, that one need simply "Ask the fact for the form." This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as [[Harold Bloom|Bloom]] who has stated in summary form concerning the early 21st century that: "The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold (2006).

== Elements ==

=== Prosody ===
{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Prosody is the study of the meter, [[rhythm]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as [[iambic pentameter]]), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the [[scansion|scanning]] of poetic lines to show meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhythm ====
{{Main article|Timing (linguistics)|tone (linguistics)|Pitch accent}}
[[File:Robinsonjeffers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robinson Jeffers]]]]

The methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schülter, Julia|title=Rhythmic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2005|pages=24, 304, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger–Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yip, Moira|title=Tone|series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521773148|pages=1–4, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgens|first=Elise Bickford|title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597–1651|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0816610297|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]
The chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker-Jones|first=Arthur|title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|isbn=978-1589830868|pages=211–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bala Sundara Raman|first=L|author2=Ishwar, S|author3= Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth|title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry|journal=Tamil Internet|year=2003|pages=128–36|doi=|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.3.7738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (平 ''píng'') tone and the oblique (仄 ''zè'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (上 ''sháng'') tone, the departing (去 ''qù'') tone and the entering (入 ''rù'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed contraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.

The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter. [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[William Carlos Williams]] are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Charles O|title=Free Verse An Essay on Prosody|year=1980|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0810113169|pages=24, 44, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffers experimented with [[sprung rhythm]] as an alternative to accentual rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Systems of scansion}}
In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic [[metrical foot]] and the number of feet per line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: [[tetrameter]] for four feet and [[hexameter]] for six feet, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=25, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "[[iambic pentameter]]" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the "[[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]". This metric system originated in ancient [[Greek poetry]], and was used by poets such as [[Pindar]] and [[Sappho]], and by the great [[Tragedy|tragedians]] of [[Athens]]. Similarly, "[[dactylic hexameter]]", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the "[[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek [[epic poetry]], the earliest extant examples of which are the works of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref name=greek&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Aoidoi|title=Introduction to Greek Meter|date=January 2006|author=Annis, William S|pages=1–15|url=http://aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211254/http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |title=Examples of English metrical systems |publisher=Fondazione Universitaria in provincia di Belluno }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metrical feet in English are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] – one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (e.g. des-'''cribe''', in-'''clude''', re-'''tract''')
* [[trochee]] – one stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (e.g. '''pic'''-ture, '''flow'''-er)
* [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] – one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (e.g. '''an'''-no-tate, '''sim'''-i-lar)
* [[anapest]] – two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (e.g. com-pre-'''hend''')
* [[spondee]] – two stressed syllables together (e.g. '''heart'''-'''beat''', '''four'''-'''teen''')
* [[pyrrhic]] – two unstressed syllables together (rare, usually used to end dactylic hexameter)

There are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a [[choriamb]], a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient [[Greek poetry|Greek]] and [[Latin poetry]].&lt;ref name=greek/&gt; Languages which utilize [[vowel length]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as [[Meter (poetry)#Ottoman Turkish|Ottoman Turkish]] or [[Vedic meter|Vedic]], often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiparsky, Paul|journal=Language|pages=576–616|title=Stress, Syntax, and Meter|date=September 1975|volume=51|issue=3|doi=10.2307/412889|jstor=412889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these types of feet has a certain "feel," whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John|title=The Founding of English Meter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1961|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], as well as the differing pitches and [[vowel length|lengths]] of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|pp=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different "feet" is in describing meter. For example, [[Robert Pinsky]] has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term "scud" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=978-0691017600|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=0691017603|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]
{{Main article|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}

Rhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem,  to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration|author=Osberg, Richard H|editor=Gaylord, Alan T|title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's verse|isbn=978-0815329510|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=195–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhyme consists of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("[[internal rhyme]]"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|author=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.)|title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1994|isbn=0374176744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.&lt;ref name=kiparsky&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Daedalus|title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry|author=Kiparsky, Paul|pages=231–44|date=Summer 1973|volume=102|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.

Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=64–86|title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre|author=Russom, Geoffrey|isbn=978-0521593403|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=James JY|title=Art of Chinese Poetry|year=1990|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226486871|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.&lt;ref name=kiparsky/&gt;

==== Rhyming schemes ====
[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''[[Divine Comedy]]'': [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] see God as a point of light.]]
{{Main article|Rhyme scheme}}

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplets]]. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520038615|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0812213246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004103870|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an "a-a-b-a" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an "a-b-b-a" quatrain (what is known as "[[enclosed rhyme]]") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the "a-b-c" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81–82, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types and use of differing rhyming schemes is discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].

=== Form in poetry ===
Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry, and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitworth|first=Michael H|title=Reading modernist poetry|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405167314|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].

==== Lines and stanzas ====
Poetry is often separated into lines on a page. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.

Lines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, "''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''" ("Night, street, lamp, drugstore"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]

Other poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dalrymple, Roger|title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-0631232902|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dróttkvætt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three "lifts" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1405137386|pages=269–80|editor=McTurk, Rory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual presentation ====
[[File:Visual poetry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35|[[Visual poetry]]]]
{{Main article|Visual poetry}}
Even before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. [[Acrostic]] poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Harvard Theological Review|title=Acrostics and Metrics in Hebrew Poetry|author=Freedman, David Noel|volume=65|issue=3|date=July 1972|pages=367–92|doi=10.1017/s0017816000001620}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Jewish literature#Poetry|Hebrew]] and [[Chinese poetry]], the visual presentation of finely [[calligraphy|calligraphed]] poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kampf|first=Robert|title=Reading the Visual – 17th century poetry and visual culture|year=2010|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3640600113|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[printing]], poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to [[concrete poetry]] or [[asemic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Willard|title=The aesthetics of visual poetry|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226063256|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Wired|author=Sterling, Bruce|title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing|date=13 July 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027152452/http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archivedate=2009-10-27|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diction ===
{{Main article|Poetic diction}}
Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic diction: a study in meaning|year=1987|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0819560261|edition=2nd|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct [[grammar]]s and [[dialect]]s are used specifically for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Philology|author=Sheets, George A|title=The Dialect Gloss, Hellenistic Poetics and Livius Andronicus|pages=58–78|volume=102|issue=1|date=Spring 1981|doi=10.2307/294154|jstor=294154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blank|first=Paula|title=Broken English: dialects and the politics of language in Renaissance writings|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415137799|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Register tone|Registers]] in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|title=21st-century modernism: the new poetics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=978-0631219705|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval lyric: genres in historical context|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252025365|editor=Paden, William D|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetic diction can include [[rhetorical device]]s such as [[simile]] and [[metaphor]], as well as tones of voice, such as [[irony]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|name=The Poetics of Aristotle|1974}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of [[Modernism]], some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=90–96|editors=Davis, Alex; Jenkins, Lee M}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[surrealism|Surrealists]] have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of [[catachresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=San Juan|first=E, Jr|title=Working through the contradictions from cultural theory to critical practice|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0838755709|pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allegory|Allegorical]] stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 BCE, are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treip|first=Mindele Anne|title=Allegorical poetics and the epic: the Renaissance tradition to Paradise Lost|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813118314|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notables examples include the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', a 13th-century French poem, [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Ploughman]]'' in the 14th century, and [[Jean de la Fontaine]]'s ''Fables'' (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain [[symbols]] or [[allusion]]s that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=P|title=Allegory and symbol – a fundamental opposition?|journal=Language and Literature|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323–38|doi=10.1177/0963947005051287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid [[imagery (literature)|imagery]] for effect. The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and [[haiku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Modern Haiku|volume=35|issue=2|pages=21–44|year=2004|author=Gilbert, Richard|title=The Disjunctive Dragonfly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" or "the wine-dark sea") or a longer [[refrain]]. Such repetition can add a sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
{{see also|Category:Poetic form}}
Specific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. In more developed, closed or "received" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an [[elegy]] to the highly formalized structure of the [[ghazal]] or [[villanelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=160–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the [[Glossary of poetry terms|glossary]].

=== Sonnet ===
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakespeare]]]]
{{Main article|Sonnet}}

Among the most common forms of poetry, popular from the [[Late Middle Ages]] on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–17|title=Petrarch and Petrarchism|author=Minta, Stephen|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1980|isbn=0719007488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.

Sonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or "turn," a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a "but" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.
[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]
Sonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Quiller-Couch, Arthur|title=[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of "sonnets" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.

=== Shi ===
[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], "On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]"]]
{{Main article|Shi (poetry)}}
''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:詩|詩]]|s=[[wikt:诗|诗]]|p=shī|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Within this form of poetry the most important variations are "folk song" styled verse (''[[yuefu]]''), "old style" verse (''[[gushi (poetry)|gushi]]''), "modern style" verse (''[[jintishi]]''). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1–2 and 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; The "old style" verse (''gushi'') is less formally strict than the ''jintishi'', or regulated verse, which, despite the name "new style" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as [[Shen Yue]] (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661–702 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 111 and 115&lt;/ref&gt;  A good example of a poet known for his ''gushi'' poems is [[Li Bai]] (701–762 CE). Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faurot|first=Jeannette L|title=Drinking with the moon|year=1998|publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals|isbn=978-0835126397|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yugen|title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse|journal=T'ang Studies|date=1 June 2004|volume=2004|issue=22|pages=81–125|doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712–770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schirokauer|first=Conrad|title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations|year=1989|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0155055698|edition=2nd|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villanelle ===
[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.H. Auden]]]]
{{Main article|Villanelle}}

The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=314|author=Kumin, Maxine|title=An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art|chapter=Gymnastics: The Villanelle|editor=Varnes, Kathrine|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0472067251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night]]" in {{cite book|author=Thomas, Dylan|title=In Country Sleep and Other Poems|publisher=New Directions Publications|year=1952|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.H.

=== Limerick ===
{{main article|Limerick (poetry)}}
A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.

=== Tanka ===
[[File:Kakinomoto Hitomaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|[[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]]]]
{{Main article|Tanka}}
Tanka is a form of unrhymed [[Japanese poetry]], with five sections totalling 31 ''[[onji]]'' (phonological units identical to [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|title=Global linguistic flows|editors=Samy Alim, H; Ibrahim, Awad; Pennycook, Alastair|isbn=978-0805862836|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. Tanka were written as early as the [[Asuka period]] by such poets as [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] (''fl.'' late 7th century), at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Robert H|title=Japanese court poetry|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804715249|pages=86–92|author2=Miner, Earl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as "[[waka (poetry)|waka]]"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes. By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term ''waka'' ("Japanese poetry") came to be used exclusively for tanka. Tanka are still widely written today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The tanka anthology: tanka in English from around the world|year=2003|publisher=Red Moon Press|isbn=978-1893959408|pages=xxx–xlviii|editor1=McCllintock, Michael |editor2=Ness, Pamela Miller |editor3=Kacian, Jim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiku ===
{{Main article|Haiku}}
Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the ''[[hokku]]'', or opening verse of a [[renku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 ''onji'', structured in a 5-7-5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contain a [[kireji]], or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a [[kigo]], or season-word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haiku moment: an anthology of contemporary North American haiku|year=1993|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|isbn=978-0804818209|editor=Ross, Bruce|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous exponent of the haiku was [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–1694).

=== Khlong ===
{{Main article|Thai poetry}}
The ''khlong'' ({{lang|th|โคลง}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ|}}) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms. This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with ''mai ek'' ({{lang|th|ไม้เอก}}, {{IPA-th|máj èːk|}}, {{lang|th|◌่}}) or ''mai tho'' ({{lang|th|ไม้โท}}, {{IPA-th|máj tʰōː|}}, {{lang|th|◌้}}). This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks. It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong"&gt;{{cite web|title=โคลง Khloong|work=Thai Language Audio Resource Center|url=http://thaiarc.tu.ac.th/poetry/khloong/khloonge.html|publisher=Thammasat University|accessdate=6 March 2012}} Reproduced form {{cite book|last=Hudak|first=Thomas John|title=The indigenization of Pali meters in Thai poetry|year=1990|series=Monographs in International Studies, Southeast Asia Series|issue=87|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|location=Athens, Ohio|isbn=978-0896801592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''khlong'', a stanza (''bot'', {{lang|th|บท}}, {{IPA-th|bòt|}}) has a number of lines (''bat'', {{lang|th|บาท}}, {{IPA-th|bàːt|}}, from [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Pada (foot)|pāda]]''), depending on the type. The ''bat'' are subdivided into two ''wak'' ({{lang|th|วรรค}}, {{IPA-th|wák|}}, from Sanskrit ''varga'').&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In literary studies, ''line'' in western poetry is translated as ''bat''. However, in some forms, the unit is more equivalent to ''wak''. To avoid confusion, this article will refer to ''wak'' and ''bat'' instead of ''line'', which may refer to either.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''wak'' has five syllables, the second has a variable number, also depending on the type, and may be optional. The type of ''khlong'' is named by the number of ''bat'' in a stanza; it may also be divided into two main types: ''khlong suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sù.pʰâːp|}}) and ''khlong dan'' ({{lang|th|โคลงดั้น}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ dân|}}). The two differ in the number of syllables in the second ''wak'' of the final ''bat'' and inter-stanza rhyming rules.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong" /&gt;

==== Khlong si suphap ====
The ''khlong si suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสี่สุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sìː sù.pʰâːp|}}) is the most common form still currently employed. It has four ''bat'' per stanza (''si'' translates as ''four''). The first ''wak'' of each ''bat'' has five syllables. The second ''wak'' has two or four syllables in the first and third ''bat'', two syllables in the second, and four syllables in the fourth. ''Mai ek'' is required for seven syllables and ''Mai tho'' is required for four, as shown below. "[[Dead word (Thai language)|Dead word]]" syllables are allowed in place of syllables which require ''mai ek'', and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.

=== Ode ===
[[File:Quintus Horatius Flaccus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Horace]]]]
{{Main article|Ode}}

Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as [[Pindar]], and Latin, such as [[Horace]]. Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Thomas|title=English lyrics from Dryden to Burns|year=2000|publisher=Elibron|isbn=978-1402100642|pages=155–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ode generally has three parts: a [[strophe]], an [[antistrophe]], and an [[epode]]. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gayley|first=Charles Mills|title=English Poetry|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1417900862|edition=Reprint|author2=Young, Clement C|page=lxxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the [[qasida]] in [[Persian poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuiper|first=edited by Kathleen|title=Poetry and drama literary terms and concepts|year=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Educational Services|isbn=978-1615305391|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghazal ===

{{Main article|Ghazal}}

The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Urdu poetry|Urdu]] and [[Bengali poetry]]. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a [[refrain]] at the end of the second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an identical meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan E|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-0816054541|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=43|issue=3|date=Autumn 1990|title=Musical Gesture and Extra-Musical Meaning: Words and Music in the Urdu Ghazal|author=Qureshi, Regula Burckhardt|pages=457–97|doi=10.1525/jams.1990.43.3.03a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazals have a classical affinity with [[Sufism]], and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Isaac|title=The Mystique of the Mushaira|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 June 1981|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1981.4745121.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the masters of the form is [[Rumi]], a 13th-century [[Persia]]n poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Religion &amp; Literature|volume=20|issue=1|date=Spring 1988|title=Mystical Poetry in Islam: The Case of Maulana Jalaladdin Rumi|author=Schimmel, Annemarie|pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most famous poet in this type of poetry is [[Hafez]], whose poems often include the theme of exposing hypocrisy. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater.

== Genres ==
In addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different [[genre]]s and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chandler, Daniel|title=Introduction to Genre Theory|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=10 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509013303/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|archivedate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=16, 391–402|title=Beyond the screen: transformations of literary structures, interfaces and genres|editors=Schafer, Jorgen; Gendolla, Peter|isbn=978-3837612585|publisher=Verlag|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative poetry ===
[[File:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]]]
{{Main article|Narrative poetry}}

Narrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a [[narrative|story]]. Broadly it subsumes [[epic poetry]], but the term "narrative poetry" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to [[human interest]]. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of [[Homer]] have concluded that his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were composed from compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English [[ballad]]s, and [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] heroic poems—is [[performance poetry]] with roots in a preliterate [[oral tradition]]. It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, once served as [[memory]] aids for [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=22–45|author=Kirk, GS|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|isbn=978-0521136716|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable narrative poets have included [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Juan Ruiz]], [[William Langland]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Luís de Camões]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[Anne Carson]].

=== Lyric poetry ===
[[File:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christine de Pizan]] ''(left)'']]
{{Main article|Lyric poetry}}

Lyric poetry is a genre that, unlike [[epic poetry|epic]] and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more [[person]]al nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting [[Character (arts)|characters]] and actions, it portrays the poet's own [[feeling]]s, [[Qualia|states of mind]], and [[perception]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blasing|first=Mutlu Konuk|title=Lyric poetry : the pain and the pleasure of words|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691126821|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable poets in this genre include [[Christine de Pizan]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]].

=== Epic poetry ===
[[File:Camões, por Fernão Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Luís de Camões|Camões]]]]
{{Main article|Epic poetry}}
Epic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of [[narrative]] literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a [[heroic]] or [[mythological]] person or group of persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hainsworth|first=JB|title=Traditions of heroic and epic poetry|year=1989|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|isbn=978-0947623197|pages=171–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of epic poems are [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', [[Luís de Camões]]' ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnama]]'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]''. While the composition of epic poetry, and of [[long poem]]s generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. [[Derek Walcott]] won a [[Nobel prize]] to a great extent on the basis of his epic, ''[[Omeros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/press.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1992: Derek Walcott|publisher=Swedish Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satirical poetry ===
[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]]]]
Poetry can be a powerful vehicle for [[satire]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for [[political]] purposes. A notable example is the Roman poet [[Juvenal]]'s [[Satires of Juvenal|satires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dominik|first=William J|title=Roman verse satire: Lucilius to Juvenal|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=978-0865164420|pages=1–3|author2=Wehrle, T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same is true of the English satirical tradition. [[John Dryden]] (a [[Tory]]), the first [[Poet Laureate]], produced in 1682 ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'', subtitled "A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S." (a reference to [[Thomas Shadwell]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1056|editor=Black, Joseph|title=Broadview Anthology of British Literature|volume=1|isbn=978-1554810482|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Review of English Studies|volume=24|issue=93|title=Satirical Inversion of Some English Sources in Rochester's Poetry|author=Treglown, Jeremy|pages=42–48|doi=10.1093/res/xxiv.93.42|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satirical poets outside England include [[Poland]]'s [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Azerbaijan]]'s [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir|Sabir]] and [[Portugal]]'s [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]].

=== Elegy ===
[[File:Gray0004.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Thomas Gray]]]]
{{Main article|Elegy}}
An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a [[lament]] for the dead or a [[funeral]] song. The term "elegy," which originally denoted a type of poetic meter ([[elegiac]] meter), commonly describes a poem of [[mourning]]. An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pigman|first=GW|title=Grief and English Renaissance elegy|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521268714|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Elegy|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134209064|pages=10–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included [[Propertius]], [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Chidiock Tichborne]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Milton]], [[Thomas Gray]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Evgeny Baratynsky]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].

=== Verse fable ===
[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ignacy Krasicki|Krasicki]]]]
{{Main article|Fable}}
The fable is an ancient [[literary genre]], often (though not invariably) set in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It is a succinct story that features [[anthropomorphized]] animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a "[[moral]]"). Verse fables have used a variety of [[meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhyme]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harpham|first=Geoffrey Galt; Abrams, MH|title=A glossary of literary terms|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495898023|page=9|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable verse fabulists have included [[Aesop]], [[Vishnu Sarma]], [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], [[Marie de France]], [[Robert Henryson]], [[Biernat of Lublin]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]], [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Félix María de Samaniego]], [[Tomás de Iriarte]], [[Ivan Krylov]] and [[Ambrose Bierce]].

=== Dramatic poetry ===
[[File:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Josef Stieler).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Goethe]]]]
{{Main article|Verse drama and dramatic verse|Theatre of ancient Greece|Sanskrit drama|Chinese Opera|Noh}}
Dramatic poetry is [[drama]] written in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. [[Greek tragedy]] in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith, Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=Sanskrit Drama in its origin, development, theory and practice|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1992|pages=57–58|isbn=978-8120809772}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the ''[[bianwen]]'' verse dramas in China, forerunners of [[Chinese Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dolby, William|title=Chinese Theater: From Its Origins to the Present Day|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theatre|editor=Mackerras, Colin|isbn=978-0824812201|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1983|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Asia]]n verse dramas also include Japanese [[Noh]]. Examples of dramatic poetry in [[Persian literature]] include [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s two famous dramatic works, ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'' and ''[[Khosrow and Shirin]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s tragedies such as ''[[Sohrab|Rostam and Sohrab]]'', [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi]]'', [[Asad Gorgani|Gorgani]]'s tragedy of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'', and [[Vahshi Bafqi|Vahshi]]'s tragedy of ''[[Farhad]]''.

=== Speculative poetry ===
[[File:Edgar Poe 1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]]]
{{Main article|Speculative poetry}}
Speculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major sub-classification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are "beyond reality", whether via [[extrapolation]] as in [[science fiction]] or via weird and horrific themes as in [[horror fiction]]. Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is sometimes seen as the "father of speculative poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dutcher, Roger|title=The alchemy of stars|year=2005|publisher=Science Fiction Poetry Association|isbn=978-0809511624|pages=11–17|author=Allen, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poe's most remarkable achievement in the genre was his anticipation, by three-quarters of a century, of the [[Big Bang theory]] of the [[universe]]'s origin, in his then much-derided 1848 [[essay]] (which, due to its very speculative nature, he termed a "[[prose poem]]"), ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rombeck |first=Terry |date=January 22, 2005 |authorlink= |title=Poe's little-known science book reprinted |journal=Lawrence Journal-World &amp; News |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/jan/22/poes_littleknown_science/ |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilynne Robinson|Robinson, Marilynne]], "On Edgar Allan Poe", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

=== Prose poetry ===
[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]]]
{{Main article|Prose poetry}}

Prose poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry. It may be indistinguishable from the [[microfiction|micro-story]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|a.k.a.]] the "[[short short story]]", "[[flash fiction]]"). While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monte|first=Steven|title=Invisible fences: prose poetry as a genre in French and American literature|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803232112|pages=4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as ''The Prose Poem: An International Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/prosepoem/|title=''The Prose Poem: An International Journal''|accessdate=10 December 2011|publisher=Providence College}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemporary Haibun Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryhaibunonline.com|title=''Contemporary Haibun Online''|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Haibun Today''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haibuntoday.com/pages/about.html|title=''Haibun Today''}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to that genre and its hybrids.  Latin American poets of the 20th century who wrote prose poems include [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Giannina Braschi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/octavio-paz|title= Poetry Foundation: Octavio Paz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi".

Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem 'Empire of Dreams'.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Light poetry}}

Light poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous.  Poems considered "light" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]], including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme and heavy [[alliteration]]. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English is usually formal.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Ogden Nash]], [[X. J. Kennedy]], [[Willard R. Espy]], and [[Wendy Cope]].

=== Slam poetry ===
{{Main article|Poetry slam}}

[[File:FivaMC.jpg|thumb|upright|Poet performing at a [[poetry slam]]]]

Slam poetry is a genre, developed since about 1984, in which performers comment emotively, aloud before an audience, on personal, social, or other matters. It focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation, and voice inflection. Slam poetry is often competitive, at dedicated "[[poetry slam]]" contests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.powerpoetry.org/actions/5-tips-spoken-word]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|300px|''Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam'', [[National Gallery]], London]]
[[File:Desidrius Erasmus by Hans Holbein.jpg|thumb|[[The Louvre]], 1523]]

[[Hans Holbein the Younger]] painted the '''''Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]''''' several times, and his paintings were much copied, at the time and later. It is difficult to disentangle Holbein's original work from that of his workshop and other copyists. Possibly five largely original versions survive, as well as a number of drawings made as studies.  

Holbein's portraits played an important part in spreading the painter's reputation across Europe, as they and their copies were widely distributed. When Holbein moved to England he had a letter of recommendation from Erasmus to [[Thomas More]], in whose house he initially lived.

==Commission==
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] of Rotterdam (1466/69–1536) was a renowned humanist scholar and theologian. He moved in 1521 to Basel, the city where Hans Holbein the Younger lived and had his workshop. Such was the fame of Erasmus, who corresponded with scholars throughout Europe, that he needed many portraits of himself to send abroad to his protectors; although not an admirer of painting, he understood the power of image.&lt;ref name="bg155"&gt;Bätschmann; Griener, 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quentin Matsys]] painted a noticeably younger Erasmus, writing, in 1517, and used another profile portrait for a [[medal]] in 1519.  [[Albrecht Dürer]] made a portrait in [[engraving]] in 1526. But it was Holbein's images that were endlessly copied. Of the work Erasmus wrote in 1524, "Recently I sent again two portraits of Erasmus to France, painted by a very skillful artist. The artist carried along my portrait to France."&lt;ref name="bg155" /&gt; 

==Versions==
There are three main portrait types: a three-quarters view, probably of 1523, best-known from the National Gallery version; a profile view also from 1523, reading, as in the [[Louvre]], and an older three-quarters view, perhaps c. 1530, probably best represented by the [[portrait miniature]], a roundel 10cm across, in the [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]. 

All of these were produced in many versions, several probably at least partly by Holbein himself, or supervised by him. The pose and face tends to remain the same, but the clothes and backgrounds vary. It seems to have been Holbein's practice to make a very [[List of portrait drawings by Hans Holbein the Younger|careful drawing of his subjects]] (though no full drawings for any of these portraits survive) and to then produce the painted portrait without the sitter being present.  The Louvre has drawings done as studies for the hands of both its painted version and the London version.

There is also a small emblemmatic depiction of an idealized Erasmus as the Roman god Terminus (his personal emblem), of 1532, now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].
   
===London===
The version also known as '''''Portrait of Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam with Renaissance Pilaster''''' is a 1523 painting in oil and [[tempera]] on panel, in the [[National Gallery]], London (on long-term loan from the [[Earl of Radnor]]).  Holbein painted three much-copied portraits of Erasmus in 1523, of which this is the largest and most elaborate. It is likely the one sent to {{w|William Warham}}, Archbishop of Canterbury, in England. Holbein later painted Warham after he travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus, who had once lived in England himself. Holbein's portrait of Erasmus includes a Latin couplet by the scholar, inscribed on the edge of the leaning book on the shelf, which states that Holbein would rather have a slanderer than an imitator. According to art historian Stephanie Buck, this portrait is "an idealized picture of a sensitive, highly cultivated scholar, and this was precisely how Erasmus wanted to be remembered by future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Stephanie. ''Hans Holbein''. Cologne: Könemann, 1999, {{ISBN|3829025831}}, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was formerly at [[Longford Castle]], home of the Earl of Radnor, and may be referred to by this.

The Greek and Latin words on the book translate to "The Herculean Labours of Erasmus of Rotterdam".

The '''Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa''' is the life-size [[sarcophagus]] of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] noblewoman dating from between 150–140 BC. Since 1887, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=466847&amp;partId=1&amp;people=94909&amp;peoA=94909-1-5&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The brightly painted sarcophagus of the Etruscan [[aristocratic]] woman Seianti was discovered in 1886 at Poggio Cantarello near [[Chiusi]] in [[Tuscany]] and was subsequently sold, along with its contents (a skeleton and some grave belongings), to the British Museum. A similar sarcophagus is in the collections of the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Florence]]. Known as the Sarchophagus of Larthia Seianti, the two women were probably from the same dynastic family in ancient Chiusi.

==Description==
The sarcophagus is a [[masterpiece]] of Etruscan artwork. The deceased woman's name is inscribed in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] along the base of the chest.  She must have belonged to one of the richest families of [[Chiusi]], as Seianti is dressed sumptuously for the occasion, wearing an ornate gown and cloak, with complicated drapery falling sinuously over her body, and adorned with a [[tiara]], earrings, bracelets and a necklace. Seianti has been depicted as a mature lady, who gestures to adjust her veil, realistically revealing parts of her body in the process. She leans against a pillow and holds a mirror in her other hand, gazing into the distance.

==Scientific analysis==
Scientific analysis of the bones and teeth that were deposited in the chest indicated that Seianti probably died at about 50–55 years of age. The rather idealised face of the deceased woman depicted on the sarcophagus, which was typical of [[Etruscan art]] at the time, can be compared with an accurate and less flattering reconstruction of her face in the museum, based on the features of the deceased woman's skull.

'''''Seven Easy Pieces''''' was a series of [[performance art|performances]] given by artist [[Marina Abramović]] in [[New York City]] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in November 2005.

Although the performance art world traditionally frowns on repeating individual works, valuing their transient, ephemeral nature as intrinsic to their essence, as she aged, Abramović found herself compelled to preserve the performances that influenced her own development as an artist. Angry at seeing so many of the ideas developed in her and others' performances being appropriated without credit, including by commercial enterprises such as advertising and fashion, Abramović committed herself to archiving seven iconic works by recreating or reinterpreting them in ''Seven Easy Pieces'', but only with the expressed consent of each of the original artists or their estates. "There's nobody to keep the history straight," she told the ''New York Times'' in an interview published in early November 2005. "I felt almost, like, obliged. I felt like I have this function to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/arts/design/06kenn.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| New York Times, ''Self-mutilation is the sincerest form of flattery'', November 6, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seven Easy Pieces'' is available on DVD and is considered{{who|date=August 2018}} to be useful for performing arts students who study [[post-structuralism]]. 

''Seven Easy Pieces'' comprised seven individual works – two of her own and five by other artists – performed on seven consecutive nights beginning on November 9th. They were, in order of performance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/abramovic/ Guggenheim exhibition web page for ''Seven Easy Pieces'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Star polygon]]s and polygonal compounds are the basis for numerous figures of significance in [[arts]] and [[culture]]. The figure may be the border or interior of the polygon, or one or more closed polygonal paths that include all of the border and also have some legs crossing the interior. Impressions of [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[stars]] provide the term, but specific uses may exploit the connection or not. Stars often represent the unity of states within a country when they are used as a part of the flag.

==Five-pointed stars==
{{Main|Five-pointed star}}
[[File:Five-pointed star.svg|thumb|100px|Five-pointed star]]
The five-pointed star, if drawn with points of equal length and angles of 36° at each point, is sometimes termed a '''golden five pointed star'''.&lt;ref name="symbDict5-point"&gt;[http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2824.html The five-pointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111121634/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2824.html |date=11 November 2006 }} from {{cite book |last=Liungman |first=Carl G. |year=2004 |title=Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=HME Publishing |isbn=91-972705-0-4}}. Retrieved 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; If the colinear edges are joined together, a [[pentagram]] is produced, which is the simplest of the [[unicursal hexagram|unicursal]] [[star polygon]]s, and a symbol of [[mysticism|mystical]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] significance.
Originally, the five-pointed star (pentangle), forming a pentagram within it, represented the ten tribes of Israel that broke away from the ruling class of Judah, Benjamin, and the Priests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} There are ten "Vav" or "man" that form the five points. A circle was also added around the Israelite Star because it was the letter "Samek" meaning, "death". Today's modern Pagans tend to use all three symbols, rather than making any distinction.
The golden five-pointed star is a very common [[ideogram]] in the western world, and has particularly strong associations with military power and war. The Asian giant [[LG Corporation]]'s initials actually stand for "Lucky Goldstar" (and not "Life is Good" as many Westerners are led to believe). Many [[communism|communist]] countries (such as [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Vietnam]]) and symbols (the [[hammer and sickle]]) also incorporate [[Red star|five-pointed stars]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The five-pointed star appears in the flags of 35 countries, and also appears commonly in the [[heraldry]] of the [[United States]], and stands in contrast to the [[Vexillology|vexillologically]] rarer [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]].

The five-pointed star occurs in conjunction with a [[crescent]] in the flags of several countries to symbolize [[Islam]], appearing for example as part of the symbol of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In [[philately]], the five-pointed star signifies stamps that have not been [[postmark]]ed.

The five-pointed star is used as the symbol of the [[People Nation]] alliance of gangs from Chicago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  [[Bloods (gang)|Blood]] gangs who originated from New York, known as the United Blood Nation, also use this as a symbol as they have emulated the People Nation alliance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In the Armenian Pantheon, there is a goddess called Astlik/Astghik. In the Armenian language Astgh means star, Astghik - Little Star. Compared with Ishtar, Astara, this goddess' sign should have been the (probably)eight-pointed star.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Six-pointed stars==
Several varieties of six-pointed stars are used in Western culture:
* If the [[Collinearity|collinear edges]] of a regular six-pointed star are connected, so that two interlaced triangles are formed, a symbol results that is variously known as the [[hexagram]], [[Star of David]], or Shield of David (Magen David). This symbol is most commonly associated with [[Judaism]]. It is also used in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], but on a less frequent basis.
*The [[Ahmadiyya]] flag, ''Lawa-e-Ahmaddiyat'', contains a six-pointed star, adjacent to a crescent. 
* The [[Star of Life]], which is a six-armed cross.
* The [[Great Seal of the United States]] contains a six-pointed star made up of 13 stars (representing the original 13 colonies).
* The municipal [[flag of Chicago]] has four six-pointed stars.
* German and German-American [[hex sign]]s and [[Barnstars|barn stars]] often incorporate both five- and six-pointed stars as central themes.
* The six-pointed star is used as the symbol for the [[Folk Nation]] alliance of gangs from Chicago. Crip gang members tend to use this symbol also.

Apart from the foresaid mentions, six-pointed star formations are rare as an [[ideograph]] in Western cultures except in the case of law enforcement badges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2826.html The sixpointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111124629/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2826.html |date=11 November 2006 }} from {{cite book |last=Liungman |first=Carl G. |year=2004 |title=Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=HME Publishing |isbn=91-972705-0-4}}. Retrieved 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astrology]], some formations of a six-pointed star can signify [[fixed star]]s. In some rare instances, it can signify the date of birth on a gravestone, synonymous with the five-point star.

==Seven-pointed stars==
===Political===
A seven-pointed star appears in the [[flag]] and [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbolism of [[Australia]]. In the Australian context, the seven points (also known as the '''Commonwealth Star''', the  '''Federation Star''', the '''Seven Point Star''', or the '''Star of Federation''') is a seven-pointed star symbolising the [[Federation of Australia]] which came into force on 1 January 1901. Six points of the Star represent the six [[States and territories of Australia|original states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], while the seventh point represents the territories.

The seven-pointed stars stand in contrast to the [[vexillology|vexillologically]] more conventional [[five-pointed star]]s.

The Seal of the [[Cherokee Nation]] has an acute gold seven-pointed star in its seal.

The seven-pointed star is also used as a symbol of the [[Trinitarios]] gang from New York City.

A [[heptagram]] or '''septagram''' is a seven-pointed star drawn with seven straight strokes. There are two kinds of heptagrams:
* ''Acute heptagram'', the {7/3} [[star polygon]].
* ''Obtuse heptagram'', the {7/2} star polygon.

[[File:Jar MET DP168331 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Capodimonte porcelain]] jar painted in the stipple style of Giovanni Caselli with three figures of [[Pulcinella]] from the [[commedia dell'arte]], 1745-50.]]

'''Stippling''' is the creation of a pattern simulating varying [[Grayscale|degrees of solidity]] or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists.

==Art==
[[File:Giulio Campagnola shepherd.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Young Shepherd'', [[engraving]] using stipple technique by [[Giulio Campagnola]], around 1510]]
{{main|Stipple engraving}}
In a [[drawing]] or [[painting]], the dots are made of [[pigment]] of a single colour, applied with a [[pen]] or [[brush]]; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface.  This is similar to—but distinct from—[[pointillism]], which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Drawing Techniques| last=Ian Simpson| date=1987| pages=62–64| publisher=Headline| location=London| isbn=0-7472-0051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[printmaking]], dots may be carved out of a surface to which ink will be applied, to produce either a greater or lesser density of ink depending on the printing technique. In [[Stipple engraving|engraving]], the technique was invented by [[Giulio Campagnola]] in about 1510. Stippling may also be used in engraving or [[sculpture|sculpting]] an object even when there is no ink or paint involved, either to change the texture of the object, or to produce the appearance of light or dark shading depending on the reflective properties of the surface: for instance, stipple engraving on glass produces areas that appear brighter than the surrounding glass.

The technique became popular as a means of producing shaded [[line art]] illustrations for publication, because drawings created this way could be reproduced in simple black ink.  The other common method is [[hatching]], which uses lines instead of dots.  Stippling has traditionally been favoured over hatching in [[biological illustration|biological]] and [[medical illustration]], since it is less likely than hatching to interfere visually with the structures being illustrated (the lines used in hatching can be mistaken for actual contours), and also since it allows the artist to vary the density of shading more subtly to depict curved or irregular surfaces.

Images produced by [[halftone|halftoning]] or [[dither]]ing and computer [[Computer printer|printers]] operate on similar principles (varying the size and/or spacing of dots on paper), but do so via photographic or digital processes rather than manually. These newer techniques have made it possible to convert continuous-tone images into patterns suitable for printing, but artists may still choose stippling for its simplicity and handmade appearance. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' still features stippled and hatched portraits known as [[hedcut]]s (a style brought to the WSJ by [[Kevin Sprouls]] in 1987) in its pages, a holdover from its earlier avoidance of [[photograph]]s.

==Botany==
[[Image:Music MiguelEndara.gif|thumb|upright|Artistic composition of musical elements using stippling technique.]]
In description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of ''[[Calochortus luteus]]'', a [[lily]] endemic to [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 ''Gold Nuggets: Calochortus luteus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004094242/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term stipple can also apply to a random pattern of small depressions applied to a surface to increase the [[friction]] and make the surface easier to grip.  This process is similar to [[knurl]]ing or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as [[anatomical]] grips, where a regular pattern would not fit.  Stippling can be cast into [[plastic]] objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to [[wood]] or [[metal]] objects.

A further use of stipple indicates the damage caused by [[spider mites]] which make tiny white spots on plant leaves which can [[Coalescence (physics)|coalesce]] until the entire leaf appears silvery.

In quilt making, the term refers to background [[quilting]] in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion [[machine quilting]] by densely stitching through all layers in a relatively close repetitive design.

In [[interior decoration]], the tips of the bristles of a [[brush|stippling brush]] are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through.

In [[digital photography]], stippling refers to image noise similar to [[film grain]].

In [[forensic science]], stippling refers to a pattern of [[gunshot residue]] burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://adfs.alabama.gov/Glossary.aspx |title=Glossary of Forensic Terms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences|publisher= U.S. state government|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surautomatism''' is any theory or act in practice of [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[creative production]] taking, or purporting to take, [[surrealist automatism|automatism]] to its most absurd limits.  

In their 1945 statement ''Dialectique de la Dialectique'', [[Romania]]n surrealists [[Gherashim Luca]] and [[Dolfi Trost]] wrote,

:We have returned  to the problem of knowledge through images... by establishing a clear distinction between images produced by artistic means and images resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures, such as the operation of chance or of automatism. We stand opposed to the tendency to reproduce, through symbols, certain valid theoretical contents by the use of pictorial techniques, and believe that the unknown that surrounds us can find a staggering materialization of the highest order in indecipherable images. In generally accepting until now pictorial reproductive means, surrealist painting will find that the way to its blossoming lies in the absurd use of aplastic, objective and entirely non-artistic procedures.

The name surautomatism suggests "going beyond" automatism, but whether surautomatism is anything but a group of methods by which surrealist automatism is practiced is controversial.

Surautomatism includes [[cubomania]], [[Surrealist techniques#Entopic graphomania|entopic graphomania]] and various types of what the Romanian surrealists called "indecipherable writing".

'''Symphony No. 1 "Low"''', also known as the '''''"Low" Symphony''''', is a [[symphony]] by [[Philip Glass]] based on [[David Bowie]]'s album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.

In 1996, Glass based [[Symphony No. 4 (Glass)|another symphony]] on David Bowie's following album ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]''.

==The symphony==
The symphony was composed in 1992 and scored for full orchestra with 2 [[flute]]s, [[piccolo]], 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 trumpets, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], percussion, [[harp]], piano and strings (including 8 first [[violin]]s, 6 second violins, 4 [[viola]]s, 4 [[cello]]s and 2 [[double bass]]es).

The symphony has three movements:

{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman
|[[Subterraneans]]
|[[Some Are]]
|[[Warszawa (song)|Warszawa]]
}}

"Some Are", the David Bowie song on which the second movement was based, didn't feature on the original release of Low but was recorded during the Low recording sessions. The song would later be released on the [[Rykodisc]] reissue of David Bowie's album in 1991.

==Recordings==

The first recording of this work was released in 1993 under the title ''Low Symphony''. It was performed by the [[Brooklyn Philharmonic]] orchestra under the batons of [[Dennis Russell Davies]], principal conductor, and Karen Kamensek, assistant conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/low_symphony.php Philip Glass: Music: "Low" Symphony&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520085211/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/low_symphony.php |date=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Glass]] allowed ideas of Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], who worked together on [[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], to influence how he worked on the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/low_symphony.php |title=Philip Glass: Music: "Low" Symphony |publisher=philipglass.com |accessdate=18 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520085211/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/low_symphony.php |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">The '''Symphony No. 2''' by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[composer]] [[Michael Tippett]] was completed in 1957. 
[[File:Tippett 2nd Symphony LP cover.jpg|thumb]]

== Instrumentation ==
The [[symphony]] is scored for 2 [[Flutes]], (both doubling [[Piccolo]]), 2 [[Oboes]], 2 [[Clarinets]] in A, 2 [[Bassoons]], 4 [[French horn|Horns]], 2 [[Trumpets]], 3 [[Trombones]], [[Tuba]], [[Timpani]], [[Percussion]] (1 Player): [[Side drum]], [[Bass drum]], [[Cymbals]], [[Harp]], [[Piano]] (doubling [[Celesta|Celeste]]) and [[String section|Strings]].&lt;ref&gt;Study Score (ED 10620) Published by Schott &amp; Co. Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:
* 1. Allegro vigoroso
* 2. Adagio molto e tranquillo
* 3. Presto veloce
* 4. Allegro moderato

==History==
In an insightful essay accompanying the first recording of the work, Tippett writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;About the time I was finishing '[[The Midsummer Marriage]]' I was sitting one day in a small studio of Radio [[Lugano]], looking out over the sunlit lake, listening to tapes of [[Vivaldi]]. Some pounding cello and bass C's, as I remember them, suddenly threw me from Vivaldi's world into my own, and marked the exact moment of conception of the 2nd Symphony. Vivaldi's pounding C's took on a kind of archetypal quality as though to say: here is where we must begin. The 2nd Symphony does begin in that archetypal way, though the pounding C's are no longer Vivaldi's. At once horns in fifths with F sharps force the ear away from the C ground. I don't think we ever hear the C's as classically stating the key of C. We only hear them as a base, or ground upon which we can build, or from which we can take off in flight. When the C's return at the end of the Symphony, we feel satisfied and the work completed, though the final chord which is directed to "let vibrate in the air," builds up from the bass C thus: C16 C8 G C4 D2 AC#E.
&lt;br&gt;
It was some years after the incident in Lugano before I was ready to begin composition. While other works were being written I pondered and prepared the Symphony's structure: a dramatic [[Sonata form|sonata allegro]]; a song-form slow movement; a mirror-form [[scherzo]] in [[additive rhythm]]; a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]] for a finale. Apart from the rather hazy memory of the Vivaldi C's, I wrote down no themes or motives during this period. I prefer to invent the work's form in as great a detail as I can before I invent any sounds whatever. But as the formal invention proceeds, textures, speeds, dynamics, become part of the formal process. So that one comes closer and closer to the sound itself until the moment when the dam breaks and the music of the opening bars spills out over the paper. As I reached this moment in the Symphony the [[BBC]] commissioned the piece for the 10th anniversary of the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], but in the event I was a year late. It was performed first in the [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[London]], in February 1958 and conducted by [[Sir Adrian Boult|Adrian Boult]].&lt;ref name="LP sleeve notes, ZRG 535"&gt;LP sleeve notes, ZRG 535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Second Symphony mediates accessibility with radical approaches of symphonic construction, and represents both a compendium of his past accomplishments and a springboard for future ones.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schuttenhelm, ''The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination was a direct result of shifting his conceptualization of symphonic form away from historical models towards a more subjective approach.&lt;ref name="Thomas Schuttenhelm 2013"&gt;Thomas Schuttenhelm, ''The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Its creative cycle resulted in one of Tippett’s most accessible compositions, while the re-conceptualization of the form was the foundation for the archetypal division that functioned as the source of his most original and innovative designs.&lt;ref name="Thomas Schuttenhelm 2013"/&gt; Tippett’s radical shift in style did not occur until two years after he completed the Symphony, and is most commonly associated with [[King Priam]] (1958–61) and the Second Piano Sonata (1962), but the genesis of this shift occurred during the period in which he was conceiving the Symphony, and its sketches are filled with the nascent techniques that would come to define a new period.&lt;ref name="Thomas Schuttenhelm 2013"/&gt;

The Symphony's premiere, given by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, at the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, conducted by Adrian Boult, was notoriously a disaster. Neither orchestra nor conductor was regarded as ideal for the work. In the 1930s, the early years of the BBCSO, it had been regarded as one of the best orchestras in the country, and Boult as a superb conductor; they were renowned in particular for their performances of new music. Post-war, however, the BBCSO was generally agreed to have declined in quality, and in particular to be less adept in new music. Boult, meanwhile, was now approaching 70, and becoming conservative in his repertoire; he had been far down the list of preferred conductors for the evening.

At the premiere, broadcast live on BBC radio, the performance broke down a few minutes into the first movement and had to be restarted. Boult apologised to the audience for the error: "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen." It later transpired that the orchestra's leader, Paul Beard, had altered the bowing of the string parts to make them more readable, and so public criticism for the collapse was transferred to him and his modifications (critics included the conductor [[John Barbirolli]], himself a string player, who approved the original notation of the parts and blamed Beard's rewrites for obliterating the natural off-beat phrasing that Tippett had carefully notated). Recent scholarship, however, indicates that the cause of the collapse lay rather with the flute getting lost and beginning a solo passage a bar too early; the woodwind section en masse proceeded to get a bar ahead of the strings. When the horns (who were taking their cues from the woodwind parts) joined in the melee by coming in a bar too early also, Boult took the decision to halt the performance. Up to the point of halting, the string section had been serenely playing on, ignoring the confusion in the rest of the orchestra; they were still together, and had arrived at the correct point. Ironically, therefore (in view of the opprobrium attached to Beard), the blame for the collapse may indeed have lain with Boult&amp;mdash;it is unclear if the flute player took an independent decision to enter early or was mistakenly cued in by Boult. In a further irony (in view of the insistence of Barbirolli and Tippett that the original notation was preferable, and that rescoring would cause more problems than it would solve), the flute part (which had NOT been altered) was at the point of error written in the complex manner deemed by Beard as unnecessarily complicated for the violins.{{OR|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Relations between Tippett and the BBC were already strained, due to Tippett's missing the requested 1957 deadline, and his subsequent tardiness in meeting the new February 1958 deadline (he only informed them of having completed the work in November 1957, and the parts required printing and proofing before the piece could be rehearsed by the orchestra). The misfortunes of the premiere soured them further: the BBC Controller of Music insisted that the orchestra could not be blamed for the performance, since it was "equal to all reasonable demands" made by composers, implying that Tippett's demands were not reasonable; stung by this, Tippett made no attempt to defend the BBCSO from criticism, later using his autobiography to blame all involved except himself and his own writing (he had, he said, urged to Boult and Beard that the editorial changes would do more harm than good&amp;mdash;"and so it turned out"). He broke a scheduled commitment to conduct the piece himself at the BBC Proms later that year, with Boult instead taking the engagement. In response, the BBC invited him to the rehearsals of that performance, on condition that he did not approach within 40 feet of the platform, a condition which required him to shout out for Boult's attention and summon him over whenever he wanted to make a point to the conductor.{{OR|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Despite the blame which still generally attaches to Beard for the mistake (e.g., in a 2005 British library exhibition), orchestras since have routinely played the piece using his editorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levison &amp; Farrer, ''Classical Music's Strangest Concerts'', pp.162-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical analysis==
The symphony is considered by some writers to be a transitional work,&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, David(1980).Michael Tippett: An introductory study. Faber and Faber. p.60&lt;/ref&gt; marking a change from the abundant lyricism of works such as the [[opera]] ''[[The Midsummer Marriage]]'' and the [[Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli|Corelli Fantasia]] to a tauter, more austere style as represented by the opera ''[[King Priam]]'' and the second Piano Sonata of 1962. In these works the forward thrust of the classical sonata allegro is replaced by a new fragmentation using the juxtaposition of strongly contrasting blocks  of material. Another distinct change is the increased use of [[polytonality]] and [[tonality|non-tonal harmony]]: the chord on C referred to in the article above is a clear example of this, consisting of a compression of the [[chord (music)|chord]]s of C, D and A in one vertical alignment.

Here is Tippett's own description of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the vital matters to be decided in the period of gestation before composition, is the overall length; and then the kind of proportions that best fit this length. The Symphony takes about 35 minutes to play and its four movements are tolerably equal, though the slow movement is somewhat longer than the others. So it is not a long, spun-out rhapsodic work, but a short, concentrated dramatic work. And this concentration, compression even, is made clear from the word go.&lt;br&gt;
 The opening sonata allegro makes big dramatic gestures above the pounding, opening C's, and is driven along and never loiters. It divides itself into fairly equal quarters: statement, first argument, re-statement, second argument and coda. the lyrical quality of the slow movement is emphasised by presenting the 'song' of the song-form (after a short introduction) at first on divided cellos and later on divided violins. In between lies a lengthy and equally lyrical passage for all the string body. The woodwind and brass accompany the 'songs' with cluster-like chords decorated by harp and piano.The movement ends with a tiny coda for the four horns, a sound I remembered from the 'Sonata for Four Horns' which I had already written.&lt;br&gt;
The scherzo is entirely in additive rhythm. Additive rhythm means simply that short beats of two quavers and long beats of three quavers are added together indefinitely in a continuous flow of unequal beats. The movement has been called an 'additive structure', which I think very well describes it. At the central point heavy long beats are contrasted against light short beats in a kind of tour de force of inequality issuing in a climax of sound with ''brilliante'' trumpets to the foe. the movement then unwinds, via a [[cadenza]]-like passage for piano and harp alone to its end.&lt;br&gt;
The finale is a fantasia in that its four sections do not relate to each other, like the four sections of the first movement sonata allegro, but go their own way. Section 1 is short and entirely introductory; section 2 is the longest and is a close-knit set of variations on a [[Ostinato|ground]]; section 3 is a very long  melody which begins high up on violins and goes over at half-way to cellos who take the line down to their bottom note, the C of the original pounding C's'; section 4 is a coda of five gestures of farewell.&lt;ref name="LP sleeve notes, ZRG 535"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Slave Ship''''', originally titled '''''Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhoon&lt;!--sic--&gt; coming on''''',&lt;ref&gt;Turner's title, with period spelling of [[typhoon]]. [http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/slave-ship-slavers-throwing-overboard-the-dead-and-dying-typhoon-coming-on-31102]&lt;/ref&gt; is a painting by the British artist [[J. M. W. Turner]], first exhibited in 1840. Measuring 35 3/4 x 48 1/4 in. in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]], it is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. In this classic example of a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[maritime painting]], Turner depicts a ship, visible in the background, sailing through a tumultuous sea of churning water and leaving scattered human forms floating in its wake.

== History ==
J.M.W. Turner was inspired to paint ''The Slave Ship'' in 1840 after reading ''The History and Abolition of the Slave Trade''&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages A Global History'', Volume II. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008, p. 795.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Thomas Clarkson]]. In 1781, the captain of the [[slave ship]] ''[[Zong Massacre|Zong]]'' had ordered 133 slaves to be thrown overboard so that insurance payments could be collected. This event probably inspired Turner to create his landscape and to choose to coincide its exhibition with a meeting of the British [[Anti-Slavery Society]]. Although slavery had been outlawed in the [[British Empire]] since [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|1833]], Turner and many other [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] believed that slavery should be outlawed around the world. Turner thus exhibited his painting during the anti-slavery conference, intending for [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who was speaking at the event, to see it and be moved to increase British anti-slavery efforts.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} Placed next to the painting were lines from Turner's own untitled poem, written in 1812:

::"Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay;
::Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds
::Declare the Typhon's coming.
::Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard
::The dead and dying – ne'er heed their chains
::Hope, Hope, fallacious Hope!
::Where is thy market now?"

== Description ==
The first impression that the painting creates is of an enormous deep-red sunset over a stormy sea, an indication of an approaching typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20070513/NEWS/705130496|title=Early warning signs of an approaching tropical cyclone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon closer inspection one can discern a ship sailing off into the distance. The masts of the ship are red, matching the blood-red colour of the sky and the sickly copper colour of the water, which serves to blur the lines between various objects in the painting.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt; The ship's sails are furled, revealing that it is preparing for the typhoon. In the foreground can be seen a number of bodies floating in the water; their dark skin and chained hands and feet indicate that they are slaves, thrown overboard from the ship. Looking even more carefully, one can see fish and sea monsters swimming in the water, possibly preparing to eat the slaves, and sea gulls circling overhead above the chaos.

Consistent with Turner's emphasis on colour in many of his other works, the painting's central focus is on the interactions of various colours. Few defined brush strokes appear in the painting, and objects, colours, and figures become indistinct. Rather, objects are defined by their colours in the painting, and some objects (like the bodies of the slaves and the incoming storm) have no real border at all, being solely defined by the contrast with the pigments around them. The most prominent colours are the red of the sunset which encroaches into the water and ship as well, and the maroon of the bodies and hands of the slaves.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;

== Style and interpretation ==
Turner's emphasis on colour rather than design is typical of many Romantic works of the time. The indistinct shapes and the pervasiveness of the sunset's blood-red colour serve to convey a focus on nature and illustrate the idea that nature is superior to man. Other colours in the painting, such as the cool blue of the ocean and the black caps of the water, bring the ocean's hues to life and give the viewer a sense of the true emotions of the natural world. The fact that the figures in the painting are depicted as minuscule and that even the ship is shunted to the background in favour of the water and the sun further serve to decrease the emphasis on humanity and transfer it to nature.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;

By placing the emphasis on nature rather than on figures or objects, Turner evokes the concept of the "sublime", coined by [[Edmund Burke]]. The idea of the sublime is of the utter powerlessness and terror of humanity in the face of nature; by dramatising the strength of the waves and sun, Turner uses ''The Slave Ship'' to encapsulate, perfectly, Burke's definition of the term. Turner's decision to paint the work with a series of quick, frenzied brush strokes rather than carefully defined lines adds to the intensity of the painting, serving to make the viewer feel even more overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt; Though the painting's size is relatively small compared to many Romantic landscape paintings, it still captivates the viewer in arguably a more powerful way.

Some viewers have argued that ''The Slave Ship'' actually represents Turner's reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The painting might be viewed as an [[allegory]] against the exploitation of slaves and other human labour in favour of machines and economic advancement, represented by the coming storm engulfing the cruel captain. However, the storm could also be viewed as a representation of nature's dominance over man and of the ultimate futility in trying to industrialise and advance society.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Museum of Fine Arts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/slave-ship-slavers-throwing-overboard-the-dead-and-dying-typhoon-coming-on-31102|title=Slave Ship (Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On)|date=25 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/art/crisis/crisis4e.html George P.

Mr. [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] is educated in art up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage, last year, when I was ignorant. His cultivation enables him—and me, now—to see water in that glaring yellow mud, and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame, and crimson sunset glories; it reconciles him—and me, now—to the floating of iron cable-chains and other unfloatable things; it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top of the mud—I mean the water. The most of the picture is a manifest impossibility—that is to say, a lie; and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie. But it enabled Mr. Ruskin to do it, and it has enabled me to do it, and I am thankful for it. A Boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the Slave Ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows, and said it reminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes. In my then uneducated state, that went home to my non-cultivation, and I thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye. Mr. Ruskin would have said: This person is an ass. That is what I would say, now.}}

The [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]], who was the first owner of ''The Slave Ship'', wrote, "If I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this."&lt;ref name="Boston Museum of Fine Arts" /&gt;

The painting was the subject of an extended poetic sequence or [[verse novel]] by [[David Dabydeen]], ''Turner'' (1994; reissued 2002).

[[Image:Solvognen-00100.tif|thumb|280px|The gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot.]]
[[Image:Solvognen Do 2010 1278.tif|thumb|280px|The left side of the disk shows no traces of gilding.]]

The '''Trundholm sun chariot''' ({{lang-da|Solvognen}}), is a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] artifact discovered in [[Denmark]]. It is a representation of the  [[sun chariot]],  a [[bronze]] statue of a [[horse]] and a large bronze disk, which are placed on a device with spoked [[wheels]].

The sculpture was discovered with no accompanying objects in 1902 in a [[peat bog]] on the Trundholm moor in [[Odsherred]] in the northwestern part of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], (approximately {{Coord|55|55|N|11|37|E|}}). It is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]].

==Description==
The horse stands on a bronze rod supported by four wheels. The rod below the horse is connected to the disk, which is supported by two wheels. All of the wheels have four [[spoke]]s.  The artifact was cast in the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] method.

The whole object is approximately {{convert|54|x|35|x|29|cm|in|abbr=on}} in size (width, height, depth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsbutikken.dk/default.aspx?load=main&amp;Data=ProductInfo&amp;key=180029&amp;group=kopier2 Nationalmuseet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disk has a diameter of approximately {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}. It is gilded on one side only, the right-hand side (when looking at the horse from behind). It consists of two bronze disks that are joined by an outer bronze ring, with a thin sheet of gold applied to one face. The disks were then decorated with punches and gravers with zones of motifs of concentric circles, with bands of zig-zag decoration between borders.  The gold side has an extra outer zone which may represent rays, and also a zone with concentric circles linked by looping bands that "instead of flowing in one direction, progress like the steps of the dance, twice forward and once back".  The main features of the horse are also highly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides of the disk have been interpreted as an indication of a belief that the [[sun]] is drawn across the heavens from East to West during the day, presenting its bright side to the Earth and returns from West to East during the night, when the dark side is being presented to the Earth. A continuation around a globe would have the same result.  It is thought that the chariot was pulled around during religious rituals to demonstrate the motion of the sun in the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184; see also Nationalmuseet video&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The sculpture is dated by the National Museum to about 1400 BC,&lt;ref&gt;http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/danmark/oldtid-indtil-aar-1050/bronzealderen-1700-fkr-500-fkr/solvognen/&lt;/ref&gt; though other dates have been suggested. It was found before pollen-dating was developed, which would have enabled a more confident dating.

A model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is surprising; they would not be expected to appear until the end of the Late Bronze Age, which ranges from 1100 BC to 550 BC.  This and aspects of the decoration may suggest a Danubian origin or influence in the object, although the Nationalmuseet is confident it is of Nordic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103334/http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/sw59869.asp Nationalmuseet video]; Sandars, 183-185 favours Danubian influence, and a date at the end of the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible function as a calendar==
[[File:Trundholm sun chariot animation.gif|thumb|Rotating image]] 
Klaus Randsborg, professor of archeology at the [[University of Copenhagen]],  has pointed out that the sum of an addition of the number of spirals in each circle of the disk, multiplied by the number of the circles in which they are found, counted from the middle (1x1 + 2x8 + 3x20 + 4x25), results in a total of 177, which comes very close to the number of days in six [[synodic]] months, only 44 min 2.8 s shorter each.

The [[synodic cycle]] is the time that elapses between two successive conjunctions of an object in the sky, such as a specific star, with the sun. It is the time that elapses before the object will reappear at the same point in the sky when observed from the Earth, so it is the ''apparent'' orbital period observed from Earth.

He asserts his belief that this demonstrates that the disk was designed by a person with some measure of astronomic knowledge and that the sculpture may have functioned as a calendar.

==Sun chariot in Indo-European mythology==

===Norse mythology===

The chariot has  been interpreted as a possible [[Bronze Age]] predecessor to [[Skinfaxi]],&lt;ref name=LINDOW272&gt;[[John Lindow|Lindow, John]]. (2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs]'', page 272. [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-515382-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the horse that pulled [[Dagr]], the personification of day, across the sky.

===Celtic Pantheon===
The sky god [[Taranis]] is typically depicted with the attribute of a spoked wheel.

===Rigveda===
[[File:Surya chariot.jpg|thumb|right|Surya's chariot]]
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
The [[Rigveda]] also reflects the mytheme of the Sun chariot. [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].85 mentions the sun god's bride as  seated on a chariot pulled by two steeds.
The relevant verses are the following (trans.  Griffith):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
10. Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven:
     Bright were both Steeds that drew it when [[Surya]] approached her husband's home.&lt;br&gt;
11. Thy Steeds were steady, kept in place by holy verse and Sama-hymn:
     All car were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky,&lt;br&gt;

'''Urmston Musical Theatre''' (UMT) is an [[amateur theatre]] company based in [[Urmston]], [[Greater Manchester]], UK.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1911 as the Urmston and District Operatic Society, and produced ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the Urmston Public Hall. In 1947, the name was changed to the Urmston Amateur Operatic Society which remained until it assumed the current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk The Urmston Musical Theatre], Retrieved on 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known personalities have been connected with the society, notably the current President, [[Matthew Kelly]], who appeared in the society's 1963 production of ''[[The King and I]]'' along with Peter Pennington, who became a featured soloist with the ''[[Black and White Minstrel Show|Black and White Minstrels]]''. Others include [[Brian Trueman]] who appeared in the group's production of ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/merrie.htm Merrie England 1951] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the late Lord Winstanley and [[Winston Churchill (1940–2010)|Winston Churchill]] MP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/pastshows.htm UMT Past Shows] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; grandson of the wartime leader and son of [[Randolph Churchill]] MBE.

In 1958, 1959 and 1960, the society won the [[Manchester Evening News]] Prompter's Palm award for their productions of ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''Magyar Melody'' respectively. The society has also been nominated in the Manchester Musical Awards on a number of occasions for both overall and individual performances. In 1995, they won the "Best Musical" award for their production of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''.

Junior members aged between 8 years and 18 years, in addition to being involved in some of the main shows and pantomimes, have presented a variety of musicals in their own right since 1993 including ''[[Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', ''Andy Capp'', ''[[Copperfield (musical)|Copperfield]]'', and ''Dazzle''.

In the early 1930s, the theatre almost closed when reserves fell to £3, but for the enthusiasm and dedication of its members and patrons.

In the context of [[film]] and [[television]] production, a '''visual effects supervisor''' is responsible for achieving the creative aims of the director or producers through the use of [[visual effects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles/4265_vfx_supervisor Creativeskillset.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is a creative role, most supervisors possess a strong technical background and are capable of making informed decisions about the most efficient and effective technique to employ to solve the problem at hand.  Often a supervisor will work in tandem with a visual effects producer and [[CG Supervisor|computer graphics supervisor]].

Supervisors can be employed directly by a film production company or work for a visual effects company.  Often there are several VFX supervisors on a project, although there is typically a senior VFX supervisor directing their efforts.

Specific responsibilities vary somewhat depending on the nature of the production, however most supervisors:
* Handle a VFX project from conception through to completion
* Manage and direct the technical, artistic, and production personnel
* Possess a knowledge of various visual effects techniques with emphasis on camera set-ups and film knowledge with an eye for composition and camera work. 
* Accurately predict timing and associated costs of project 
* Collaborate on the bidding and negotiation processes 

The Visual Effects Society is a prominent trade organization representing the interests of visual effects professionals.

'''Welsh art''' refers to the traditions in the [[visual arts]] associated with [[Wales]] and [[Welsh people|its people]]. Most art found in, or connected with, Wales is essentially a regional variant of the forms and styles of the rest of the [[British Isles]], a very different situation from that of [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh literature]]. The term '''Art in Wales''' is often used in the absence of a clear sense of what "Welsh art" is, and to include the very large body of work, especially in [[landscape art]], produced by non-Welsh artists in Wales (or with a Welsh subject) since the later 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Houseley explores the lack of a clear sense of "Welsh art" among contemporary artists and in Wales generally. See also Morgan, 371–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:British Museum gold thing 501594 fh000035.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The gold [[Mold Cape]], [[Bronze Age]], 1900–1600 BC]] 
[[Prehistoric Wales]] has left a number of significant finds: [[Kendrick's Cave]], [[Llandudno]] contained the [[Kendrick's Cave Decorated Horse Jaw]], "a decorated horse jaw which is not only the oldest known work of art from Wales but also unique among finds of [[Ice Age art]] from Europe", and is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick's Cave [https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/touring_exhibitions_and_loans/sharing_the_treasures.aspx BM touring exhibition], [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/d/decorated_horse_jaw.aspx BM Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 "faint scratchings of a speared reindeer" were found on a cave wall on the [[Gower peninsula]] which probably date to 12,000–14,000 BC, placing them among the earliest art found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-14272126 "Carving found in Gower cave could be oldest rock art"], BBC News online, South-West Wales, July 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mold Gold Cape]], also in the British Museum, and [[Banc Ty'nddôl sun-disc]] in the [[National Museum of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]] are likewise some of the most important British works of art from the [[Bronze Age]]. 
  
Many works of [[Iron Age]] [[Celtic art]] have been found in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1938/ | title=Celtic Art in Iron Age Wales| work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=3 May 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the finds from the period shortly before and after the Roman conquest, which reached Wales in AD 74-8, are especially significant. Pieces of metalwork from [[Llyn Cerrig Bach]] on [[Anglesey]] and other sites exemplify the final stages of [[La Tène style]] in the British Isles, and the [[Capel Garmon Firedog]] is a spectacular luxury piece of [[ironwork]], among the finest in Europe from the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1940/ | title=Stunning ironwork firedog uncovered in farmers field | work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=4 May 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abergavenny Leopard Cup]], from the decades after the conquest, was found in 2003, and shows the presence of imported Roman luxury products in Wales, perhaps belonging to a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1951/ | title=Exquisite Roman treasure gives up its secrets | work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=9 September 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricemarch Psalter, Psalm 1.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Ricemarch Psalter]], c. 1080, the start of Psalm 1:"Beatus vir..."]]

In the [[Early Medieval]] period, the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Wales participated in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles and a number of [[illuminated manuscript]]s [[:Category:Illuminated manuscripts of Welsh origin|possibly of Welsh origin]] survive, of which the 8th century [[Hereford Gospels]] and [[Lichfield Gospels]] are the most notable.  The 11th century [[Ricemarch Psalter]] (now in [[Dublin]]) is certainly Welsh, made in [[St David's]], and shows a late Insular style with unusual [[Viking]] influence, which is also seen in surviving pieces of metalwork of that period.

There are only fragments of the architecture of the period remaining.  Unlike Irish [[high cross]] and [[Pictish stones]], early Welsh standing stones mainly employ geometric patterns and words, rather than figure representation; however, 10th century stones represent Christ and various saints.  Little metalwork survives from the early period of the 5th–9th centuries in Wales. However, archaeological sites at Dinas Powys have revealed various artifacts such as [[penannular brooch]]es and other pieces of jewellery. Similar brooches have been discovered a site at Penycorddyn-mawr, near [[Abergele]], dating to the 8th century. During this period, the construction of [[Holy well]]s was also particularly commonplace in Wales.

Wales has rarely been very prosperous, and the most striking medieval architecture is military, often built by the Normans and English, especially the famous "[[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]]" and [[Beaumaris Castle]] in [[Anglesey]], recognised as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, [[Caerphilly Castle]] and the castles of the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the Great (such as [[Criccieth Castle]] and [[Dolbadarn Castle]]). There are a number of impressive [[List of abbeys and priories in Wales|monastic ruins]]; Welsh medieval churches are nearly all relatively modest, including the cathedrals.  They very often had wall-paintings, panel altarpieces and much other religious art, but as in the rest of Britain very little has survived.  [[Conwy]], an English garrison town with its medieval walls almost entirely intact, has a notable example of a 13th-century medieval stone town-house.

==The Renaissance in Wales==
[[Peter Lord (art historian)|Peter Lord]] suggests that the Renaissance began in Wales around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Art-historian-Peter-Lord-talks-new-book-Tradition/story-28873873-detail/story.html "Art historian Peter Lord talks The Tradition: A New History of Welsh Art: "It's a book for everyone" ", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 7 March 2016]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the art produced in this period was created in or for the church. [[Strata Florida Abbey]], for example, retains some of its medieval decorated tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/strata-florida-abbey/?lang=en|title=Strata Florida Abbey|website=Cadw|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread destruction that took place during the Reformation and later the Commonwealth, a number of Welsh churches retain fragments of medieval [[stained glass]].  These include [[All Saints' Church, Gresford]], St Michael's Church, [[Caerwys]], St Mary's Church, [[Treuddyn]], St Elidan's Church, [[Llanelidan]], Church of St Mary &amp; St Nicholas, [[Beaumaris]], St Gwyddelan's Church, [[Dolwyddelan]], and [[St David's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stainedglass.llgc.org.uk/main.php?func=nextpage&amp;terms=&amp;page=3|title=Medieval fragments|website=Stained Glass in Wales|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteenth-century wall paintings have been uncovered in several Welsh church buildings, including St Cadoc's Church, [[Llancarfan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25214557 "Welsh church uncovers stunning medieval wall paintings", BBC News, 6 December 2013]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Illtyd's Church, Llantwit Major]] (which has a painting of [[Saint Christopher]] believed to date from around 1400),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Llantwit Major Historical Society|title=St. Illtud's Church|url=http://www.llantwitmajorhistorysociety.co.uk/#/st-illtuds-church/4565870953|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Teilo's Church, Llandeilo Tal-y-bont]].  The latter, during its reconstruction at [[St Fagans National History Museum]] during the 1990s, was found to contain wall paintings from several different periods, the earliest estimated as being from the first half of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/medieval-wall-paintings/medieval-wall-paintings.htm Tom Organ, "Reconstructing Medieval Wall Paintings at St Teilo's", www.building.conservation.com]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The wall paintings at Llancarfan are said to be "beyond compare in Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mind-blowing-medieval-art-unveiled-church-1888480|title='Mind-blowing’ medieval art is unveiled in church|author=Claire Miller|website=WalesOnline|date=28 March 2013|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Miss Catherine Jones of Colomendy, near Mold - Richard Wilson.jpg|thumb|Rare portrait by [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], of his cousin Miss Catherine Jones of Colomendy,  c. 1740]]

[[Plas Mawr]], a grand Elizabethan town-house in Conwy, built by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]], a local man who had been English ambassador to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], has been extensively restored by [[Cadw]], both inside and out, to reflect its appearance when built in the second half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/plasmawr/?lang=en Cadw: Plas Mawr]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Wales has numerous country houses from all periods after the Elizabethan, many still containing good portraits, but these were mostly painted in London or on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/galleries/faces/ "Faces of Wales" from the National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture==
Within Wales, [[portraiture]] is not common in the medieval and post-medieval periods, and the Welsh nobility and gentry usually went to London or other English centres to have their portraits painted; many of these remain in Welsh collections. [[Katheryn of Berain]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/articles/2011-10-10/Katheryn-of-Berain/ National Museum of Wales: Katheryn of Berain]. Accessed 2 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed Tudor ancestry and earned the nickname "Mam Gymru" ("Mother of Wales") because of her network of relationships and descendants from four marriages, was painted by [[Adriaen van Cronenburgh]], a Dutch painter.  The portrait was commissioned by her husband, Sir [[Richard Clough]], a merchant whose business caused the couple to settle briefly in Antwerp. Clough himself died before he could bring his wife to the new house he had built for her.  Plas Clough, near his home town of Denbigh, includes a Flemish-style crow-stepped gable&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-1064-plas-clough-denbigh#.VwFSNnarSM8 British Listed Buildings: Plas Clough, Denbigh]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms of the Holy Sepulchre (Clough had been made a [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]] earlier in his career) are painted on a plaque, but there are no surviving contemporary portraits of Clough himself.

[[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1570)]], was one of the first Welsh nobles known to have collected paintings on a large scale.  A portrait of him, dating from the 1560s, is held by the [[National Museum of Wales]]; it is attributed to [[Steven van Harwijck]], another Dutch artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=9 National Museum of Wales - William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, artisan painters such as [[William Roos]] and [[Hugh Hughes (painter)|Hugh Hughes]] began to seek portrait commissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llgc.org.uk/collections/learn-more/portraits/paintings-and-drawings/ National Library of Wales: Paintings and Drawings]. Accessed 18 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Roos's 1835 portrait of preacher [[Christmas Evans]] is held by the [[National Museum of Wales]], as is Hughes' 1826 portrait of [[William Jenkins Rees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_works&amp;item=379&amp;type=artist Art Collections Online: Hugh Hughes].

The best of the few Welsh artists of the 16th to 18th centuries tended to move elsewhere to work, but in the 18th century the dominance of [[landscape art]] in [[English art]] brought them motives to stay at home, and brought an influx of artists from outside to paint Welsh scenery, which was "discovered" by artists rather earlier than later landscape hotspots like the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]].  The Welsh painter [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] (1714–1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist, but rather more notable for Italian scenes than Welsh ones, although he did paint several on visits from London.

Wilson's  pupil [[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]] (1742–1803), has a rather higher status today than in his own time, but mainly for his city scenes painted in Italy, though his ''The Bard'' (1774, Cardiff) is a classic work showing the emerging combination of the [[Celtic Revival]] and [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ac.uk/en/2261/ NMOW, Welsh Artists of the 18th Century].  Though mainly known as a portraitist, [[John Downman]], born and died in Wales, is also noted for unusually realistic Italian townscape studies, and some Welsh landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to live in Wales on inheriting the family estate, but largely stopped painting.  For most visiting artists the main attraction was dramatic mountain scenery, in the new taste for the [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] partly stimulated by [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757), though some earlier works were painted in Wales in this strain.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 52–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Early works tended to see the Welsh mountains through the prism of the 17th century Italianate "wild" landscapes of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Gaspard Dughet]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1770s a number of guide books had been published, including Joseph Cradock's ''Letters from Snowdon'' (1770) and ''An Account of Some of the Most Romantic Parts of North Wales'' (1777).  [[Thomas Pennant]] wrote ''Tour in Wales'' (1778) and ''Journey to [[Snowdon]]'' (1781/1783); though Welsh himself, Pennant had published a ''Tour in Scotland'' first, in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 61&lt;/ref&gt;  The first of a series of British tours by another leading promoter of the picturesque, [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]], was ''Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the year 1770'', but not published until 1782.  [[Paul Sandby]] made his first recorded visit to [[Wales]] in 1770, later (1773) touring south Wales with Sir [[Joseph Banks]], resulting in the 1775 publication of ''XII Views in South Wales'' and a further 12 views the following year, part of a 48-plate series of [[aquatint]]s of Welsh views commissioned by Banks. This was an early example of many print series and illustrated books on Wales, often as valuable in terms of income to the artists as original works.

What might fifty years earlier have been merely regarded as inconvenience in travel could now been seen as an exciting adventure worth making the subject of a painting, as in [[Julius Caesar Ibbetson]]'s ''[[Phaeton (carriage)|Phaeton]] in a Thunderstorm'' (1798, now [[Temple Newsam]], Leeds) which shows a carriage struggling up a rough mountain road. It has a label on the back by the artist, recording that the incident occurred when he was travelling in Wales with the artist [[John "Warwick" Smith]] and the aristocrat [[Robert Fulke Greville]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 52 &amp; 54. [http://www.artchive.com/web_gallery/reproductions//235001-235500/235144/size1.jpg Image of ''[[Phaeton (carriage)|Phaeton]] in a Thunderstorm'']&lt;/ref&gt; Ibbetson visited Wales often, and was also one of the first artists to record the Welsh [[Industrial Revolution]], and scenes of Welsh life.

North Wales tended to be more visited; the young [[watercolour]]ist [[John Sell Cotman]] embarked on his "first extended sketching tour" in 1800, starting from Bristol then following "a well-trodden path into the [[Wye Valley]], through [[Brecknockshire]] to [[Llandovery]] and north to [[Aberystwyth]]. In Conway he joined a group of artists gathered around the amateur [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]]" perhaps meeting [[Thomas Girtin]] there, and continuing to [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] and [[Llangollen]]. A second trip followed in 1802; he continued to use motifs from his sketches throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Holcomb, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists often in Wales in this period included [[Francis Towne]], the brothers [[Cornelius Varley|Cornelius]] and [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] and John's pupils [[Copley Fielding]] and David Cox (for whose lifelong attachment to Wales see below). Even the caricaturist [[Thomas Rowlandson]] visited with [[Henry Wigstead]], a colleague, and they published ''Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales, in the Year 1797'', an illustrated book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/remarksonatourt00wigsgoog|title=Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales: In the Year 1797|first=Henry|last=Wigstead|year=1800|publisher= W. Wigstead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=24221 |title=Rowlandson, Thomas|first=John|last=Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic War]]s made continental travel impossible for long periods, increasing the visitors to Wales and other parts of Britain. The young [[J. M. W. Turner]] made his first extended tour to South and mid-Wales in 1792, followed by North Wales in 1794, and a seven-week tour of Wales in 1798.  He also visited Yorkshire and Scotland in the 1790s, but was unable to visit Europe until after the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, when he reached the [[Alps]]; he did not visit Italy until 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton &amp; Lyles, 326-7&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his key early works drew on his Welsh travels, although they were painted back in London. His "first large classicising watercolour, a [[Claude Lorrain|Claudeian]] view of [[Caernarvon Castle]] at sunset" was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1799, along with an oil of the same subject, and the next year he showed another view of the castle, this time with small foreground figures of "a [[bard]] singing to his followers of the destruction of Welsh civilization by the invading armies of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]", another Claudeian formula that he was to repeat many times in major works for the rest of his career, and was arguably the first large "exhibition watercolour", reaching into the realm of [[history painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilton &amp; Lyles,pp. 176 &amp; 260.  Respectively: Private Collection, Mellon Centre for British Art, Tate.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
[[File:Cox - A WELSH FUNERAL.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], ''A Welsh Funeral'', c. 1850]]
It remained difficult for artists relying on the Welsh market to support themselves until well into the 20th century. The 1851 census records only 136 people describing their occupation as "artist" out of a population of 945,000, with a further 50 engaged in [[fine arts]]-related occupations such as [[engraving]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, John, ''The art of piety: the visual culture of Welsh Nonconformity'', p.75, University of Wales Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7083-1298-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Act of Parliament]] in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff|Cardiff School of Art]] opened in 1865.  Prior to that the annual report for 1855 of the government [[Science and Art Department]] shows a list of the larger type of Art School in many British cities, but none in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;1855, Table p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Under a recently introduced new system "Local Schools of Art" had been established in 1853 in [[Llanelly]] and [[Merthyr]], but had already closed; those in [[Swansea]] and [[Carmarthen]] continued, and [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] had applied to establish a school. There were "Drawing Schools" in [[Aberdare]] and  [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], but apparently nothing at all in Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;1855, Appendix A, pp. 21–26&lt;/ref&gt; However all these pre-1857 schools, except perhaps Swansea, were mainly teaching school age children, usually in their normal schools, and training in industrial design or teacher-training under the elementary stages of the "[[South Kensington system]]".&lt;ref&gt;1855, pp. xxii–xxx&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Mansel Lewis - Snowdonia.jpg|thumb|Mansel Lewis, ''[[Snowdonia]]'']]

Graduates of the new fine arts Welsh colleges still very often had to leave Wales to work.  Established artists continued to move in the opposite direction, at least for the summer. [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]] was an English 19th century landscapist who spent much time in Wales, for many years spending the summer based in [[Betws-y-Coed]], a popular centre for artists, including the English [[Henry Clarence Whaite]] and the German [[Hubert von Herkomer]], one of whose wives was Welsh.  Landscape continued to be the main focus, although the Welsh artist [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mansel_Lewis Charles William Mansel Lewis] was among those who painted common working people, with varying measures of realism or picturesqueness. The "Betws-y-Coed artist's colony" was one of the groups forming the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]] in 1881; this was always a group for exhibiting rather than a teaching institution, based in Conwy, until 1994 in Plas Mawr (see above).[[File:Walescw.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Deffroad Cymru, the Awakening of Wales'' (1911), by [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1873–1934)]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcaconwy.org/our_history-5.aspx Royal Cambrian Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptors [[John Evan Thomas (Welsh sculptor)|John Evan Thomas]] (1810–1873) and Sir William [[Goscombe John]] (1860–1952) made many works for Welsh commissions, although they had settled in London. Even [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1873–1934), whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was based in London. [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (1886–1966) and [[Andrew Vicari]] (b. 1938) had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France.  Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] was Welsh by origin, but spent little time in Wales.

Perhaps the most famous Welsh-born painters were [[Augustus John]] and his sister [[Gwen John]], though they mostly lived in London and Paris; however the landscapists Sir [[Kyffin Williams]] (1918–2006) and [[Peter Prendergast (artist)|Peter Prendergast]] (1946–2007) remained living in Wales for most of their lives, though well in touch with the wider art world. [[Ceri Richards]] was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff, and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including [[Surrealism]]. Various artists have moved to Wales, usually the countryside, though paintings of [[Cardiff]] of around 1893–97 by the American artist [[Lionel Walden]] are in museums in Cardiff and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1860 National Museum of Wales, Walden]&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Eric Gill]], whose colony included for his most artistically productive period (1924–1927) the London-born Welshman [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], and the sculptor [[Jonah Jones (sculptor)|Jonah Jones]]. [[The Kardomah Gang]] was an intellectual circle centred on the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and poet and artist [[Vernon Watkins]] in Swansea, which also included the painter [[Alfred Janes]]; the eponymous cafe was destroyed by a German bomb in 1941.

The situation gradually improved after World War II, with the appearance of new art groups. ''The South Wales Group'' was established in 1948 (and continues today as [[The Welsh Group]] with membership from across Wales).&lt;ref name="The Welsh Group"&gt;[http://www.thewelshgroup-art.com/#!about-amdanom/ciaa] The Welsh Group website.

In 1956 when the ''South Wales Group'' failed to become a southern Academy, the [[56 Group Wales]] also emerged,&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=50+Years+of+the+Welsh+Group.+Peter+Wakelin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IF8vUcqiBoe50QWNxYDQCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA “50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of promoting modern Welsh art beyond Wales' borders.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 39–43, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in the industrial valleys the [[Dowlais]] Settlement, delivering art classes and activities was established in the 1940s by artists including [[Heinz Koppel]] and [[Arthur Giardelli]] and the [[Rhondda Group]] was formed in the 1950s, a loose group of art students whose most notable member was [[Ernest Zobole]], whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the juxtaposition of the industrialised buildings of the valleys set against the green hills that surround them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ernest-zobole/ | title=Walesart, Ernest Zobole | work=BBC Wales online | author= | date=  | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1970s, Paul Davies formed [[Beca (artist group)|Beca]], a radical Welsh group whose founding was in part a reaction to the drowning of [[Capel Celyn]].&lt;ref name="ArtinWales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artcornwall.org/features/Iwan_Bala_Art_in_Wales.htm | title=Art in Wales: Politics of Engagement or Engagement with Politics? | work=artcornwall.org | author= | date= | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beca used a mixture of artistic expression, including installation, painting, sculpture and performance, engaging with language, environmental and land rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2008) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorative arts==
[[File:Dynevor Service (Plate) LACMA 55.101.4b.jpg|thumb|Swansea porcelain plate, c. 1817]]
South Wales had several notable potteries in the late 18th and 19th centuries, beginning with the [[Cambrian Pottery]] (1764–1870, also known as "[[Swansea]] pottery") and including [[Nantgarw Pottery]] near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine [[porcelain]], and then utilitarian pottery until 1920.  [[Portmeirion Pottery]] (from 1961) has never in fact been made in Wales.

Despite the fact that considerable quantities of [[silver]] (in association with [[lead]]), and much smaller amounts of [[gold]], were mined in Wales, there was little silversmithing in Wales in the Early Modern period.  It did not help that the Crown gave itself ownership of mines of [[precious metal]]s, which were largely used for minting currency, some of which was marked with the [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] to show its origin.  The Welsh gentry mostly had their silver made in English cities.

==Contemporary Welsh Art==
Today Welsh and Wales based artists, including members of [[The Welsh Group]], the [[56 Group Wales]], the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy]]  and artists not affiliated with any particular group, provide a varied [[contemporary art|contemporary]] tapestry of art across Wales. From the [[Abstract Art]] of Brendan Stuart Burns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.wales/arts-in-wales/inspire/make/creative-wales/creative-wales-archive/awards-2013-14/brendan-stuart-burns |title=Brendan Stuart Burns |work=Arts Council in Wales |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Martyn Jones (painter)|Martyn Jones]], to the expressive, modern figurative art of [[Shani Rhys James]], [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] or Rhŷn Williams, from the politically charged work of [[Iwan Bala]] or [[Ivor Davies (artist)|Ivor Davies]] to the [[Pop Art]] of [[Ken Elias]]. The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like [[David Tress]] or the more traditional approaches used by others like [[Rob Piercy]].

==Conceptual art in Wales==
[[File:B for Defiance by David Garner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|B for Defiance by David Garner]]
Conceptual art is represented in Wales with a number of successful artists including [[Bedwyr Williams]] and [[David Garner (artist)|David Garner]] together with performance artists like the group TRACE,&lt;ref&gt;http://huwdavidjones.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/trace-displaced-gwaithwork/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.performance-wales.org/events/tracedisplaced.html&lt;/ref&gt; creating and showing work in Wales and beyond. A number of Welsh galleries focus on conceptual art, with the most significant perhaps being ''Mostyn''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mostyn.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in north Wales and ''[[Chapter Arts Centre]]'' and ''g|39''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g39.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in south Wales. The Gold Medal at '[[Y Lle Celf]]' in the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] has seen a notable trend towards more conceptual approaches over the last ten or so years, with [[Installation art|Installation work]] being the usual focal point.&lt;ref&gt;http://huwdavidjones.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/art-at-the-national-eisteddfod-of-wales/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 development of the Artes Mundi prize and Wales's presence at the Venice Biennale has strengthened the country's international reputation for [[Conceptual art|Conceptual]] and [[Installation art]].

===Artes Mundi and Wales at the Venice Biennale===

Since 2003 the [[Artes Mundi]] biennial art prize has been held at the [[National Museum Cardiff]]. The prize is the biggest art prize in the [[United Kingdom]] with £40,000 for each year’s winner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/artes-mundi-5-at-national-museum-cardiff&lt;/ref&gt; Though the prize has included artists who use traditional media, like paint, this is usually only part of their practice, with the focus being very much on conceptual approaches. Though the exhibition takes place in Cardiff, the focus is on international artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artesmundi.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walesartsreview.org/artes-mundi-5-national-museum-cardiff/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/artes%20mundi&lt;/ref&gt; with Tim Davies from Pembrokeshire &lt;ref&gt;http://www.artesmundi.org/en/exhibitions-prizes/artes-mundi-one&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cornwall]] born Sue Williams&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/sue-williams/&lt;/ref&gt; being the only Wales based artists to have featured to date.

Also adding to the international flavour in 2003, Wales took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with its own pavilion&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artscouncilofwales.org.uk/artsinwales/venice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/uk-in-venice&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to do so ever since, showing work by conceptual Welsh artists including [[John Cale]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/john-cale&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Davies in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wai.org.uk/news/2235&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bedwyr Williams]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22736582&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''You Deserve a Drink: Boozy Misadventures and Tales of Debauchery'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallemann|first1=Caroline|title=YouTube Star Mamrie Hart Talks Airplane Cocktails, Travel Beauty Products, and Her New Book, You Deserve a Drink|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/mamrie-hart-interview|publisher=Travel + Leisure|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a memoir and cookbook written by [[YouTube personality]] and comedian [[Mamrie Hart]]. The book was published by [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] and released on May 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Putnam|first1=Lindsay|title=Mamrie Hart is YouTube’s raunchiest — and booziest — star|url=https://nypost.com/2015/05/26/mamrie-hart-is-youtubes-raunchiest-and-booziest-star/|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink for 2015004927|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2015004927|website=lccn.loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The book details humorous anecdotes and stories of Hart's life, with a cocktail recipe accompanying each chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube star and author Mamrie Hart made us a custom cocktail|url=http://fusion.net/video/139914/youtube-star-and-author-mamrie-hart-made-us-a-custom-cocktail/|publisher=Fusion|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''You Deserve a Drink'' was generally well-received by reviewers. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', actor and comedian [[Michael Ian Black]] stated that "Hart is a pull-no-punches comedian with a talent for self-deprecation in the guise of self-aggrandizement, a winning formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Michael|title=Humor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/humor.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleen Stinchcombe, writer for [[SheKnows Media|She Knows]] said that "She is undeniably a funny lady, and her humor translates beautifully — even more powerfully, I'd argue — to the page. Her jokes have more time to build, her punchlines land harder. She's created an entirely hilarious read that will delight her current fans by giving them a pitcher-sized serving of her normally shot-sized jokes and entice new readers who have enjoyed recent books by other humor heavy-hitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stinchcombe|first1=Colleen|title=Mamrie Hart's new memoir is a hilarious lesson in radical self-acceptance|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1084050/you-deserve-a-drink-is-a-book-about-radical-self-acceptance|publisher=She Knows|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
