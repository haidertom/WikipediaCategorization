:''This article presents information about the John Van Seters book; for general information about the topic, see [[Abraham#Historicity and origins|Abraham: Historicity and origins]] and [[The Bible and history]].''

'''''Abraham in History and Tradition''''' is a book by biblical scholar [[John Van Seters]].

The book is divided into two parts, ''Abraham in History'' and ''Abraham in Tradition''. In Part I, Van Seters argues that there is no unambiguous evidence pointing to an origin for the stories in the 2nd millennium BC. "Arguments based on reconstructing the patriarch's nomadic way of life, the personal names in Genesis, the social customs reflected in the stories, and correlation of the traditions of Genesis with the archaeological data of the Middle Bronze Age have all been found, in Part One above, to be quite defective in demonstrating an origin for the Abraham tradition in the second millennium B.C.". This finding has implications for certain then-current strands in Biblical criticism: "Consequently, without any such effective historical controls on the tradition one cannot use any part of it in an attempt to reconstruct the primitive period of Israelite history. Furthermore, a vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times."&lt;ref name="VanSeters1975p309"/&gt;

Part II forms a critique of "tradition-history" or "tradition-analysis", the theory current at the time that Genesis retained traces of oral traditions dating from the 2nd millennium. "There is virtually no way of deciding when oral narrative forms or motifs became associated with a particular person such as Abraham, and it could well have happened in every case when the story was first put in written form. The results of the literary examination of the Abraham tradition, in Part Two, would suggest that oral forms and motifs are confined to a rather small part of the tradition."&lt;ref name=VanSeters1975p309 /&gt;

==Impact==

===On "Biblical archaeology" and the Albright school===
The book was a landmark in [[Near Eastern Studies]] and [[Biblical archaeology]], since it challenged the dominant view, popularised by [[William Foxwell Albright]], that the patriarchal narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] can be identified on archaeological grounds with the Mesopotamian world of 2nd millennium BC. Van Seters noted that many of Albright's parallels were vague, and fit other regions than [[Mesopotamia]] and other times than 2nd millennium. Specially severe was his analysis of Genesis 14, where he pointed out that the political situation described in Genesis 14 - a Near East dominated by a coalition led by [[Elam]] and including [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]] - is not confirmed by any monuments, king lists, or other historical and archaeological sources. Van Seters also pointed out that the ten kings mentioned in Genesis 14 cannot be found in any ancient documents outside the Bible.

===On "Tradition history"===
The book was also a criticism of the school of [[Tradition history]] advanced most notably by [[Hermann Gunkel]] and [[Martin Noth]]: Van Seters "argues that Noth's (1948) idea of a "pentateuchal oral tradition" is flawed both historically (with respect to the history of Israel) and analogically (given Noth's comparisons with the development of Icelandic saga) [and] contends that traces of folkloric structure do not make it inevitable 'that the tradition as a whole, or even [certain] parts of it, derive from a pre-literate period'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oraltradition.org/bibliography/show/2043 Centre for Studies in Oral Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Seters instead proposed that Genesis was an essentially literary work, but one based on a process of supplementation by successive authors rather on a redactorial process (i.e., on the combination of separate documents by an editor or editors). This in turn amounted to a major challenge to the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], the dominant theory concerning the origins of the Pentateuch.

===On the "documentary hypothesis" and the formation of the Torah===
At the time Van Seters published "Abraham in History and Tradition" the dominant scholarly theory regarding the composition of the Pentateuch was the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]. This held that the books of the Torah, including the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] accounts of [[Abraham]] and the Patriarchs, were based on four independent sources. Each of these was originally a complete document in itself, dating from between the 10th and 7th centuries BC and combined into the final work by a [[Redactor]] (editor) in the Persian period, c.450&amp;nbsp;BC. Van Seters retained the idea of source documents but dropped the idea of a redactor, which meant dropping the documentary model itself. In its place he adopted a supplemental model, "a successive supplementation of one source or author by another," in which a [[Yahwist]] (not identical with [[Wellhausen]]'s Yahwist) working in the period of the [[Babylonian exile]] was the major but not the final author of Genesis. Van Seter's schema is as follows:&lt;ref name="VanSeters1975p313"/&gt;
* i. Pre-Yahwistic first stage: 12:1, 4a, 6a, 7, 10-20; 13:1-2; I6:1-3a, 4-9, IIab, 12; 13:18; 18:1a, 10-14; 21:2, 6-7 (all except the references to Lot). These represent a small unified work with three episodes and a brief framework.
* ii. Pre-Yahwistic second stage ("E"): 20:1-17; 21:25-26, 28-31a. This represents one unified story that originally came after the adventure in Egypt (13:1), to which it was added. It was subsequently transposed to its present position by the Yahwist, who added 20:iii. Ia ("From there ... Negeb") as a transition.
* Yahwist:
:a. brief secondary additions to previous works: 12:2-3, 6b, c8-9; 16:7b, 10, 11c, 13-14; 20:Iaα; 21:I.
:b. larger episodic units: 13:3-5, 7-17; chap. 15; 18:Ib-9, I5-19:38; 21:8-24, 27, 3Ib-34; chap. 22; chap. 24; 25:I-6, II; (chap. 26). All incorporated with some new arrangement of the materials.
* iv. Priestly:
:a. secondary genealogical and chronological additions: 11:26-32; 12:4b-5; 13:6; 16:3b, 15-16; 21:3-5; 25:7-10.
:b. larger episodic units: chaps. 17 and 23.
* v. Post-Priestly: chap. 14 (of which vv. 18-20 are secondary).

A celebrated scholarly argument ensued between Van Seters and [[Rolf Rendtorff]] over the role and existence of the redactors, Van Seters arguing that they did not exist, Rendtorff and his followers arguing that they were essential. Van Seters stated his position as follows: {{cquote|It was the Documentary Hypothesis that created the redactor as a literary device, a deus ex machina, to make the whole theory work. That is the only really distinctive feature of the Documentary Hypothesis and it is this part of the theory that Rendtorff and others have retained. Now we supposedly have editors without any authors, which is absurd ... It is high time that the "redactor" takes his leave and the author is restored to his rightful place in literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=561 Van Seter's reply] to [http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=553 Rendtorff's "What Happened to the Yahwist?"] in SBL Forum.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9542">The '''Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology''' (ACUA) serves as an international advisory body on issues relating to underwater archaeology, conservation, and submerged cultural resources management. It works to educate scholars, governments, sport divers, and the public about underwater archaeology and the preservation of underwater cultural heritage. The ACUA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/|title=» About the ACUA|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] closely affiliated with the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]] (SHA). The ACUA helps the SHA Conference Committee to organize the annual [https://sha.org/conferences/ SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology] and provides continuing education through workshops and panel discussions.

The ACUA [https://acuaonline.org/ website], [https://acuaonline.org/category/deep-thoughts/ blog], and social media platforms provide a forum for discussion and information sharing related to underwater and maritime archaeology to encourage the responsible stewardship, preservation, and protection of underwater and maritime cultural heritage. In 2013 the ACUA was recognized as an NGO by [[UNESCO]]. It actively participates in the meetings of the UNESCO Scientific and Technical Advisory Body  (STAB) on the promotion of the [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13520&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage].

== Mission ==
The Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology advocates, promotes, and provides advice on responsible public education and stewardship of underwater cultural heritage for present and future generations.

The ACUA supports the ethical principals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/ethics-statement/|title=» Ethics Statement|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The ACUA encourages all archaeologists to perform to the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. The organization's Core Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/core-principles/|title=» Core Principles|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote an ethical culture in all activities, in the work place, in the field, and in the classroom to create a climate of trust, respect, and equality. The ACUA provides further guidance on ethical obligations and standards of behavior through its statements on [https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/Statement-on-Harassment.pdf anti-harassment] and [https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/Non-Discrimination-Polocy.pdf anti-discrimination].

== Formation ==
The ACUA has been at the forefront of underwater archaeology for nearly 60 years and it the oldest organization of its type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/History-of-the-ACUA-1.pdf|title=History of the Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its genesis as the Council on Underwater Archaeology was in 1959 and its purpose was fully realized at a meeting in 1963 when a group of archaeologists, historians, and sport divers met in St. Paul, Minnesota for the first international Conference on Underwater Archaeology (CUA).

The first joint conference with the then fledgling Society for Historical Archaeology was held in 1970. By 1973, the present structure and name of the ACUA were established and shortly thereafter the SHA and CUA conferences merged. In 2003, the ACUA and SHA signed a Memorandum of Agreement, formalizing their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/organizational-documents/|title=Organizational Documents of the ACUA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The ACUA maintains several publications including: 
* ''[https://www.acuaonline.org/publications/ ACUA Underwater Archaeology Proceedings]'' comprising papers given at the annual SHA Conference. 
* [https://acuaonline.org/category/deep-thoughts/ Archaeological Photo Festival Competition] open to all SHA members to promote public outreach and education between underwater and terrestrial archaeology. Photos from the annual competition are used for an annual calendar provided to all SHA Conference attendees.
* The quarterly [https://acuaonline.org/education-careers/student-rep/ ACUA Student Newsletter], , published by the ACUA Graduate Student Members, which focuses on student research and field projects related to underwater archaeology.
* An introductory brochure on underwater archaeology available for download online in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

== Training ==
The ACUA offers a full-day ''Submerged Cultural Resources Awareness Workshop'' annually during the SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology. This workshop introduces non-specialists to issues specific to underwater archaeology. Participants learn about different types of underwater cultural heritage (UCH) sites, and the techniques used in Phase I and II equivalent surveys. This workshop does not teach participants to be underwater archaeologists, but introduces different investigative techniques, international Best Practices, and existing legislation. The purpose of this workshop is to assist non-specialists in:
* recognizing the potential for UCH resources in their areas of impact,
* budgeting for UCH resource investigations,
* reviewing UCH resource assessments, 
* developing interpretive strategies,
* providing sufficient background information to assist in making informed decisions regarding UCH resources. 
The workshop is certified by the [http://rpanet.org/? Register of Professional Archaeologists] and RPA members receive continuing professional education credit.

== Awards ==
The ACUA awards the competitive [[George R. Fischer|George Fischer]] [https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/awards/ Student Travel Award] annually to provide $1,000.00 (USD) in travel support for an international maritime archaeology student to attend and present at the annual Society for Historical and Underwater Archaeology conference.The aware is named after [[George R. Fischer|George Fischer]], a founding and emeritus member of the ACUA. The award helps to advance board's goal to support the professional development of students embarking on their nascent careers; which furthers the overall mission of the ACUA to foster the growth and development of underwater and maritime archaeology around the globe. Since the inaugural award in 2012, students hailing from the West Indies, Argentina, United Kingdom, and Australia have benefited from the support to participate in the exchange of ideas at the annual conference.

== Meetings ==
The ACUA meets regularly as part of the annual SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology.

== Leadership ==
The ACUA is composed of twelve individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/who-we-are/|title=» Who We Are|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; elected on a rotating basis for four-year terms by the membership of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The members include professionals from state and federal archaeology programs, museums, non-profit institutes, cultural resource management firms, universities, conservation laboratories, and avocational societies involved in underwater archaeology. Members hail from Europe, Canada, Australia, Mexico, South America, the Caribbean, and the United States. The board elects officers for three year terms. All board terms expire at the ACUA business meeting in January.

In addition to regularly elected members, the ACUA has Associate Members who provide their insights and expertise on technical issues, education, sport diver training, shipwreck preserves and management, and international issues. The associate members may be individuals who are invited because of their particular expertise, or institutions who are invited because of their long and outstanding contributions to the field of underwater archaeology.

Graduate Student Associates extend the council’s outreach to and input from the small but active community of students, who are the future of the field. All associate terms are two years.

==History==
In 1977, recording engineer [[Steve Remote]] partnered with Joel Schreiber to create Aura-Sonic, Ltd. Remote had been recording professionally at [[Max's Kansas City]]&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Toby. On The Road With Steve Remote. Home &amp; Studio Recording, 1990, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; since 1976 while Schreiber, a graduate from the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts, was managing a children’s clothing store in [[Flushing, Queens]]. Not content with operating a conventional recording studio, Steve decided to create a studio on wheels so they could go the client instead of the client going to them.&lt;ref name="dB Magazine"/&gt; From 1977 to 1983, Schreiber was the President of ASL with Remote acting as the Vice President and chief engineer. In 1983, Remote bought out Schreiber’s stake in the company and became the sole owner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30800">The '''British National Corpus''' ('''BNC''') is a 100-million-word [[text corpus]] of samples of written and spoken [[English language|English]] from a wide range of sources.&lt;ref name="BurnardAston1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|last2=Aston|first2=Guy|title=The BNC handbook: exploring the British National Corpus|year=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-7486-1055-3|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus covers [[British English]] of the late 20th century from a wide variety of [[genre]]s, with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.

==History==
The project to create the BNC involved the collaboration of three publishers (with the [[Oxford University Press]] as the lead collaborator, [[Longman]] and [[W. &amp; R. Chambers]]), two universities (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University]]), and the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="LeechGarsideBryant1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Garside|first2=Roger|last3=Bryant|first3=Michael|title=The large-scale grammatical tagging of text: Experience with the British National Corpus|editor= N. Oostdjik &amp; P. Haan |chapter= Corpus-based research into language: in honour of Jan Aarts|year=1994|publisher=Rodopi Publishers|location=Netherlands|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the BNC started in 1991 under the management of the BNC consortium, and the project was finished by 1994. There have been no additions of new samples after 1994, but the BNC underwent slight revisions before the release of the second edition BNC World (2001) and the third edition BNC XML Edition (2007).&lt;ref name="natcorp"&gt;[http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml ''What is the BNC?'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC was the vision of computational linguists whose goal was a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of modern (at the time of building the corpus), naturally occurring [[language]] in the form of [[speech]] and text or [[writing]] that could be analyzed by a computer. Hence, it was compiled as a general corpus to pave the way for automatic search and processing in the field of [[corpus linguistics]]. One of the ways the BNC was to be differentiated from existing corpora at that time was to open up the data not just to academic research, but also to commercial and educational uses.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leech|first=Geoffrey|title=100 million words of English|journal=English Today|year=1993|volume=9|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1017/S0266078400006854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpus was restricted to just [[British English]], and was not extended to cover [[World Englishes]].  This was partly because a significant portion of the cost of the project was being funded by the British government which was logically interested in supporting documentation of its own [[linguistic variety]].&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt; Because of its potentially unprecedented size, the BNC required funds from the commercial and academic institutions as well. In turn, BNC [[data]] then became available for commercial and academic research.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt;

==Description==
The BNC is a monolingual corpus, as it records samples of [[language]] use in [[British English]] only, although occasionally words and phrases from other languages may also be present. It is a [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic]] corpus, as only [[language]] use from the late 20th century is represented; the BNC is not meant to be a historical record of the development of [[British English]] over the ages.&lt;ref name="natcorp"/&gt; From the beginning, those involved in the gathering of written data sought to make the BNC a balanced corpus, and hence looked for data in various mediums.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt;

===Components and content===
[[File:British National Corpus structure.svg|thumb|right|upright=3.1|BNC structure]]
90% of the BNC is samples of ''[[written language|written corpus]]'' use. These samples were extracted from regional and national newspapers, published research journals or periodicals from various academic fields, fiction and non-fiction books, other published material, and unpublished material such as leaflets, brochures, letters, essays written by students of differing academic levels, speeches, scripts, and many other types of texts.&lt;ref name="gloriacappelli"&gt;[http://www.gloriacappelli.it/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/bnc.pdf ''British National Corpus'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 10% of the BNC is samples of [[spoken language]] use. These are presented and recorded in the form of orthographic transcriptions. The ''spoken corpus'' consists of two parts: one part is [[demographic]], containing the transcriptions of spontaneous natural [[conversation]]s produced by volunteers of various age groups, social classes and originating from different regions. These conversations were produced in different situations, including formal business or government meetings to conversations on radio shows and phone-ins.&lt;ref name="gloriacappelli"/&gt; These were to account for both the demographic distribution of spoken language and those of linguistically significant variation due to context.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The other part involves context-governed samples such as transcriptions of recordings made at specific types of meeting and event. All the original recordings transcribed for inclusion in the BNC have been deposited at the [[British Library Sound Archive]]. The majority of the recordings are freely available from the [[Oxford University Phonetics Lab]]oratory.

===Sub-corpora and tagging===
Two sub-corpora (subsets of the BNC data) have been released: BNC Baby and BNC Sampler. Both these sub-corpora may be ordered online via the BNC webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Products|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml?ID=products|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BNC Baby is a sub-corpus of BNC that consists of four sets of samples, each containing one million words tagged as they are in BNC itself. The words in each sample set correspond to a specific [[genre]] label. One sample set contains spoken conversation and the other three sample sets contain written text: [[academic writing]], [[fiction]] and [[newspapers]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2003|title=Reference Guide for BNC-baby|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/oldBabyDocs/index.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest (third) edition has been released and comes in XML format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New edition of BNC Baby available|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/news.xml?ID=baby2|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNC Sampler is a two-part sub-corpora, a part each for written and spoken data; each part contains one million words. The BNC Sampler was originally used in a project to work out how to improve the tagging process for the BNC, which eventually led to the BNC World edition. Throughout the project, the BNC Sampler was improved with increasing expertise and knowledge for tagging to arrive at its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Sampler: XML edition|year=2008|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/sampler/sampler.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC corpus has been tagged for grammatical information ([[part of speech]]). The tagging system, named CLAWS, went through improvements to yield the latest CLAWS4 system, which is used for tagging the BNC. CLAWS1 was based on a [[hidden Markov model]] and, when employed in automatic tagging, managed to successfully tag 96% to 97% of each text analyzed. CLAWS1 was upgraded to CLAWS2 by removing the need for manual processing to prepare the texts for automatic tagging. The latest version, CLAWS4, includes improvements such as more powerful [[word-sense disambiguation]] (WSD) abilities, and the ability to deal with variation in [[orthography]] and [[markup language]]. Later work on the tagging system looked at increasing the success rates in automatic tagging and reducing the work needed for manual processing, while maintaining effectiveness and efficiency by introducing software to replace some of the manual work.&lt;ref name=LeechGarsideBryant1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name=2leechgarsidebryant1994&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Garside|first2=Roger|last3=Bryant|first3=Michael|year=1994|title=Claws4: The Tagging Of The British National Corpus|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/versions;jsessionid=75B37141A35CA4F8D290BE74B0CB4D5E?doi=10.1.1.13.3622|publisher=Paper given at COLING'94, Lancaster: UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a new program called the "Template Tagger" was introduced for a corrective function. Tags indicating ambiguity were later added. Manual tagging is still necessary, as CLAWS4 is still unable to deal with foreign words.&lt;ref name="leechsmith2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=The British National Corpus (Version 2) with Improved Word-class Tagging|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2leechsmith2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=Automatic POS-Tagging of the Corpus|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEI and access===
The corpus is marked up following the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) and includes full linguistic [[annotation]] and contextual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=1995|title=Users Reference Guide for the British National Corpus|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc264/teaching/NLP/practicals/bnc-doc.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence for the CLAWS4 part-of-speech tagger may be purchased to use the tagger.&lt;ref name="purchase"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining a license for the CLAWS tagger|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/purchase.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a tagging service is offered at [[Lancaster University]].&lt;ref name=service&gt;{{cite web|title=The CLAWS tagging service|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/tagservice.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNC itself may be ordered with either a personal or institutional license. The edition available is the BNC [[XML]] edition and it comes with the [[Xaira]] search engine software. Ordering may be carried out via the BNC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to order|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/getting/index.xml?ID=order|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online [[corpus manager]], BNCweb, has been developed for the BNC XML edition. The interface is designed to be easy to use, and the program offers query features and functions for corpus analysis. Users can retrieve results and data from searches and analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Sebastian|last2=Evert|first2=Stefan|year=2008|title=Corpus linguistics with BNCweb: a practical guide|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-631-56315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permission issues==
The BNC was the first [[text corpus]] of its size to be made widely available. This could be attributed to the standard forms of agreement, between rights owners and the Consortium on the one hand, and between corpus users and the Consortium on the other. [[Intellectual property rights]] owners were sought for their agreement with the standard licence, including willingness to incorporate their materials in the corpus without any fees. This arrangement may have been facilitated by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated with the project. However, it was a challenge to keep the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely removed; the alternative solution of substituting the identity of a contributor with a different name was discussed, but not considered feasible.&lt;ref name=Burnard&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2002|title=Where did we go wrong? A retrospective look at the British National Corpus|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/silfitalk.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, contributors had earlier been asked only to incorporate transcribed versions of their [[speech]] and not the [[speech]] itself. While permission could be sought from initial contributors again, the lack of success in the anonymization process meant that it would be challenging to seek materials from initial contributors. At the same time, two factors compounded the unwillingness of rights owners to donate their materials: full texts were to be excluded, and there was no motivation for them to disseminate information using the corpus, particularly since the corpus operates on a non-commercial basis.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

==Problems and limitations==

===Categories===
By 2001, the BNC still had no text categorisation for written texts beyond that of domain, and no categorisation for spoken texts except by context and [[demographic]] or [[socio-economic]] classes. For example, a wide variety of imaginative texts ([[novels]], [[short stories]], [[poems]], and drama scripts) were included in the BNC, but such inclusions were deemed useless as researchers were unable to easily retrieve the [[subgenres]] on which they wanted to work (e.g., poetry).  Because this [[metadata]] was omitted in the file headers and in all BNC documentation, there was no way to know whether an "imaginative" text actually came from a novel, a short story, a drama script or a collection of poems unless the title actually included words such as  "novel" or "poem").&lt;ref name=Lee2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|year=2001|title=GENRES, REGISTERS, TEXT TYPES, DOMAINS, AND STYLES|url=http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/pdf/lee.pdf|pages=37–72|volume=5|issue=3|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2002 introduction of a new version, the BNC World Edition, BNC attempted to deal with this problem. Besides domain, there are now 70 categories for genre for both spoken and written data, and so researchers can now specifically retrieve texts by genre. Even after these additions, however, implementation is still tricky, as assigning a genre or subgenre to a text is not straightforward. The divisions are less clear for spoken data than they are for written data, as there was more variation in topic and execution. Also, there will always be possible subsets of genres of each subgenre.  How far genres are subdivided is pre-determined for the sake of a default, but researchers have the option of making the divisions more general or specific according to their needs. Categorisation is also a problem, as certain texts, while deemed to belong to an interdisciplinary genre such as linguistics, include content that is subsequently categorised into either arts or science categories due to the nature of their content.&lt;ref name=davidlee2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=David|year=2002|title=NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE BNC WORLD EDITION (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL) INDEX|url=http://pezik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BNCWIndexNotes.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923082536/http://pezik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BNCWIndexNotes.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and discourse===
Some texts were classified under the wrong category, usually because of a misleading title. Users cannot always rely on the titles of the files as indications of their real content: For example, many texts with "lecture" in their title are actually classroom discussions or tutorial seminars involving a very small group of people, or were popular lectures (addressed to a general audience rather than to students at an institution of higher learning).&lt;ref name=Lee2001 /&gt; One reason is that genre and subgenre labels can only be assigned for the majority of the texts in a category. There are subgenres within genres, and for each text the content may not be uniform throughout and may span multiple  subgenres.&lt;ref name=davidlee2002 /&gt; Also, production pressures coupled with insufficient information led to hasty decisions, resulting in inaccuracy and inconsistency in records.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The proportion of written to spoken material in the BNC is 10:1, making spoken material under-represented. This is because the cost of collecting and transcribing one million words of naturally occurring speech is at least 10 times higher than the cost of adding another million words of newspaper text. Some linguists have argued that this represents a deficiency in the corpus, since speech and writing are both equally important in a language.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt; The BNC is not ideal for the study of many features of spoken discourse, since most of its transcripts are [[Orthography|orthographic]]. [[Paralinguistic]] features are only roughly indicated.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aston|first=Guy,|year=1998|title=Learning English with the British National Corpus|url=http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/~guy/barc.htm|publisher=Paper given at 6th Jornada de Corpus, Barcelona: UPF|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations and misappropriates===
Despite being an excellent source of [[lexicon|lexical]] information, the BNC can only really be used to study a limited set of grammatical patterns, particularly those which have distinctive lexical correlates.  While it is easy enough to find all the occurrences of "enjoy", and to sort them according to the [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] category of the following word, it requires additional work to find all cases of verbs followed by a [[gerund]], since the SARA index of the BNC does not include [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] categories such as "all verbs" or "all V-ing forms".&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Some lexical correlates are also too ambiguous to allow them to be used in queries: any search for restrictive [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]] would provide the user with irrelevant data, given the number of other uses of wh-[[pronoun]]s and of that in the language (not to mention the impossibility of identifying relative clauses with pronoun deletion, as in "the man I saw").  Particular [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] categories (doubt, cognisance, disagreements, summaries, etc.) are difficult to locate for the same reason. This means, for example, that while one can compare speech by men and by women, one cannot compare speech ''to'' women and ''to'' men.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

The nature of the BNC as a large mixed corpus renders it unsuitable for the study of highly specific text-types or genres, as any one of them is likely to be inadequately represented and may not be recognisable from the encoding. For example, there are very few business letters and service encounters in the BNC, and those wishing to explore their specific conventions would do better to compile a small corpus including only texts of those types.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

==Uses==

===English language education===
There are two general ways in which corpus material can be used in language teaching.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Firstly, publishers and researchers could use corpus samples to create language-learning references, syllabuses and other related tools or materials. For example, the BNC was used by a group of Japanese researchers as a tool in their creation of an English-language&amp;ndash;learning website for learners of [[English for specific purposes]] (ESP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minn|first=Danny |author2=Sano, Hiroshi |author3=Ino, Marie |author4=Nakamura, Takahiro |title=Using the BNC to create and develop educational materials and a website for learners of English|journal=ICAME Journal|year=2005|volume=29|pages=99–113|url=http://icame.uib.no/ij29/ij29-page99-114.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website enabled English-language learners to download frequently heard and used sentence patterns, and then base their own usage of the English language on these sentence patterns. The BNC served as the source from which the frequently used expressions were extracted. In using this website, users thus relied on reference samples from the BNC to guide them in their learning of the English language. Such creation of materials that facilitate language-learning typically involves the use of very large corpora (comparable to the size of the BNC), as well as advanced software and technology. A large amount of money, time, and expertise in the field of [[computational linguistics]] are invested in the development of such language-learning material.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Secondly, the analysis of the corpus can be incorporated directly into the language teaching and learning environment. With this method, language learners are given the opportunity to categorize language data from the corpus and subsequently form conclusions about the patterns and features of their target language from their categorizations. This method involves a greater amount of work on the part of the language leaner and is referred to as “data-driven learning” by Tim Johns. The corpus data used for data-driven learning is relatively smaller, and consequently the generalisations made about the target language may be of limited value.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt; In general, the BNC is useful as a reference source for the purposes of producing and perceiving text. The BNC can be used as a [[reference]] source when studying the use of individual words in various contexts, so that learners become familiar with the different ways to use particular words in suitable contexts.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt; Other than language-related information, encyclopedic information is also found in the BNC. Learners perusing data from the BNC are also introduced to British cultural features and [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

===Bilingual dictionaries, tests and evaluation===
The BNC was the source of more than 12,000 words and phrases used for the production of a range of [[bilingual dictionaries]] in India in 2012, translating 22 local languages into English. This was part of a larger movement to push for improvements in education, the preservation of India's [[vernacular languages]], and the development of [[translation]] work.&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bilingual dictionaries to promote India’s mother tongues|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/featuredetail.asp?fid=120|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Times of Oman|date=14 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231004202/http://www.timesofoman.com/featuredetail.asp?fid=120|archive-date=2010-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large size of the BNC provides a large-scale resource on which to test programs.&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web|title=What can I do with the BNC?|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/using/index.xml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used as a test bed for the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) guidelines. The BNC has also been used to provide 20 million words to evaluate English subcategorization acquisition systems for the [[Senseval]] initiative for computational analysis of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korhonen|first=Anna|year=2002|title=EVALUATION RESOURCES for English Subcategorization Acquisition Systems|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/subcat/subcat.html|accessdate=18 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213052323/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/subcat/subcat.html|archive-date=2012-12-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

==== Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus ====
Hoffman &amp; Lehmann (2000) explored the mechanisms behind speakers' ability to manipulate their large inventory of [[collocation]]s which are ready for use and can be easily expanded grammatically or syntactically to adapt to the current speech situation. Word combinations occurring in low frequency were extracted from the BNC to offer some insight into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lijcg3vt9yAC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=WSFAIABcSr&amp;pg=PA17&amp;q=%22Collocational%20Evidence%20from%20the%20British%20National%20Corpus%22|title=Corpora Galore: Analyses and Techniques in Describing English|last=Hoffman|first=Sebastian|last2=Lehmann|first2=Hans Martin|publisher=Rodopi|year=2000|isbn=9789042004191|editor-last=Kirk|editor-first=John M.|location=Amsterdam|pages=|chapter=Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collocational behaviour of man and woman ====
Pearce (2008) examined the representation of men and women in this corpus by using [[Sketch Engine]]. The corpus query tool was used to explore grammatical behaviour of the noun [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] "man" and "woman" (i.e., the nouns "man"/"men" and "woman"/"women").&lt;ref name="icb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Michael|title=Investigating the collocational behaviour of MAN and WOMAN in the BNC using Sketch Engine|journal=Corpora|date=Nov 2008|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.3366/E174950320800004X|url=http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627053051/http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-sentential Utterances{{colon}} A Corpus Study ====
Fernandez &amp; Ginzburg (2002) investigated dialogue which included non-sentiential utterances using the BNC.&lt;ref name="nsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Raquel|author2=Jonathan Ginzburg|title=Non-sentential utterances: A corpus study|date=29 June 2002|url=http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627053051/http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students ====
Lee &amp; Swales (2006) designed an experimental course in corpus-informed English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for doctoral students at the English Language Institute (ELI) of the University of Michigan in the US.&lt;ref name="eap"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|author2=John Swales|title=A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students: Moving from available specialized corpora to self-compiled corpora|journal=English for Specific Purposes|year=2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–75|doi=10.1016/j.esp.2005.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants used three main corpora as the basis of their investigations: Hyland's Research Article Corpus, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE), and academic texts from the BNC.&lt;ref name="eap" /&gt;

== Future work ==
=== Morphological processing ===
As part of ongoing work on morphological processing, a key area of [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP), data from the BNC was used to test the accuracy, reliability and swiftness of computational tools developed to facilitate the analysis and processing of morphological markers in [[British English]].&lt;ref name="Minnen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minnen|first=Guido |author2=Carroll, John |author3=Pearce, Darren |title=Applied Morphological Processing of English|journal=Natural Language Engineering|year=2001|volume=7 | issue = 3|pages=207–223|doi=10.1017/s1351324901002728|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1213/1/minnen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The computational tools involved a program that enabled the analysis of [[inflectional morphology]] in British English (known as an analyser) and a program that generated morphological markings based on the analysis from the analyser. Data from the BNC was also used to build up an extensive  repository of information about British English morphological markers. In particular, approximately 1,100 lemmas were extracted from the BNC and compiled into a checklist which was consulted by the morphological generator before [[verbs]] that allowed consonant doubling were accurately inflected.&lt;ref name="Minnen" /&gt; Since the BNC represents a recognizable effort to collect and subsequently process such a large amount of data, it has become an influential forerunner in the field and a model or exemplary corpus on which the development of later corpora was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Čermák|first=František|title=Today's Corpus Linguistics: Some Open Questions|journal=International Journal of Corpus Linguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=265–282|doi=10.1075/ijcl.7.2.06cer}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese room argument''' holds that a program cannot give a computer a "[[mind]]", "[[intentionality|understanding]]" or "[[consciousness]]",{{efn|name=Consciousness}} regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was first presented by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his paper, "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} The centerpiece of the argument is a [[thought experiment]] known as the '''Chinese room'''.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]],{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}} which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls '''Strong AI''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount of intelligence a machine can display.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}}

==Chinese room thought experiment==
[[File:John searle2.jpg|thumb|John Searle in December 2005]]
Searle's [[thought experiment]] begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that [[artificial intelligence]] research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. It takes [[Chinese character]]s as input and, by following the instructions of a [[computer program]], produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the [[Turing test]]: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine ''literally'' "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely ''simulating'' the ability to understand Chinese?{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}{{efn|Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}} He also writes:  "On the Strong AI view, the appropriately programmed computer does not just simulate having a mind; it literally has a mind."{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=66}}}} Searle calls the first position "[[#Strong AI|strong AI]]" and the latter "weak AI".{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)" | 
Searle writes:  "Partisans of strong AI claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also (1) that the machine can literally be said to ''understand'' the story and provide the answers to questions, and (2) that what the machine and its program ''explains'' the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}
}}

Searle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. ("I don't speak a word of Chinese,"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}} he points out.)  Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.

Searle argues that, without "understanding" (or "[[intentionality]]"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as "thinking" and, since it does not think, it does not have a "mind" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that "strong AI" is false.

==History==
[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument in 1714 against [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a "mind" capable of "perception" could be constructed using only mechanical processes.{{efn|Note that Leibniz' was objecting to a "mechanical" theory of the mind (the philosophical position known as [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]].) Searle is objecting to an "information processing" view of the mind (the philosophical position known as "[[computationalism]]"). Searle accepts mechanism and rejects computationalism.}} In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the [[China brain]], also the "Chinese Nation" or the "Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It eventually became the journal's "most influential target article",{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that "the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Preston|Bishop|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. "The overwhelming majority", notes ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|BBS]]'' editor [[Stevan Harnad]],{{efn|[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]] edited ''BBS'' during the years which saw the introduction and popularisation of the Chinese Room argument.}} "still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong".{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired [[Patrick J. Hayes|Pat Hayes]] to comment that the field of [[cognitive science]] ought to be redefined as "the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harnad|2001|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle's argument has become "something of a classic in cognitive science", according to Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} [[Varol Akman]] agrees, and has described the original paper as "an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Varol Akman |last=Akman |first=Varol |year=1998 |title=Book Review — ''John Haugeland (editor), Mind Design II: Philosophy, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence'' [Journal (Paginated)] |url=http://cogprints.org/539/index.html |access-date=2018-10-02 |via=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers, philosophers have come to view it as an important part of the [[philosophy of mind]]. It is a challenge to [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and the [[computational theory of mind]],{{efn|name=Computationalism|[[Stevan Harnad]] holds that the Searle's argument is against the thesis that "has since come to be called 'computationalism,' according to which cognition is just computation, hence mental states are just computational states".{{sfn|Harnad|2005|p=1}} David Cole agrees that "the argument also has broad implications for functionalist and computational theories of meaning and of mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=1}}}} and is related to such questions as the [[mind–body problem]], the [[problem of other minds]], the [[symbol grounding|symbol-grounding]] problem, and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].{{efn|name=Consciousness}}

===Strong AI===&lt;!--This section title is linked to from several places --&gt;
[[John Searle|Searle]] identified a [[philosophical position]] he calls "strong AI":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"|This version is from Searle's ''Mind, Language and Society''{{sfn|Searle|1999|p={{Page needed|date=February 2012}}}} and is also quoted in [[Daniel Dennett]]'s ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=435}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]]: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition hinges on the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''actually having'' a mind. Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}}

The position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder [[Herbert A. Simon]] declared that "there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Simon, together with [[Allen Newell]] and [[Cliff Shaw]], had just completed the first "AI" program, the [[Logic Theorist]].}} and claimed that they had "solved the venerable [[mind–body problem]], explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of [[mind]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=46}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] wrote that "AI wants only the genuine article: ''machines with minds'', in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, ''computers ourselves''."{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=2|ps=(Italics his).}}

Searle also ascribes the following positions to advocates of strong AI:
* AI systems can be used to explain the mind;{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)"}}
* The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the mind;{{efn|Searle believes that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} He writes elsewhere, "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} This position owes its phrasing to Stevan Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}}} and
* The [[Turing test]] is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states.{{efn|"One of the points at issue," writes Searle, "is the adequacy of the Turing test."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}}}

===Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism===
In more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified "strong AI" as "computer [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]" (a term he attributes to [[Daniel Dennett]]).{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=45}} Functionalism is a position in modern [[philosophy of mind]] that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.

[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as "recognizable tenets of ''computationalism'', a position (unlike "strong AI") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|loc=p. 3 (Italics his)}} [[Computationalism]]{{efn|[[Computationalism]] is associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],{{sfn|Horst|2005|p=1}} and is held by [[Allen Newell]],{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} [[Zenon Pylyshyn]]{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} and [[Steven Pinker]],{{sfn|Pinker|1997}} among others.}} is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the [[mind]] can be accurately described as an [[information processing|information-processing]] system.

Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a "tenet" of computationalism:{{sfn|Harnad|2001|pp=3–5}}
* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);
* Computational states are [[multiple realizability|implementation-independent]]—in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that
* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the [[Turing test]] is definitive.

===Strong AI vs. biological naturalism===

Searle holds a philosophical position he calls "[[biological naturalism]]": that [[consciousness]]{{efn|name=Consciousness}} and [[intentionality|understanding]] require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes "brains cause minds"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} and that "actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains".{{sfn|Searle|1990|p=29}} Searle argues that this machinery (known to [[neuroscience]] as the "[[neural correlates of consciousness]]") must have some (unspecified) "causal powers" that permit the human experience of consciousness.{{sfn|Searle|1990}} Searle's faith in the existence of these powers has been criticized.{{efn|See the replies to Searle under [[#Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness|Meaninglessness]], below}}

Searle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, "we are precisely such machines".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.

Biological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both [[behaviorism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] (including "computer functionalism" or "strong AI").{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} Biological naturalism is similar to [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] (the position that mental states are "identical to" or "composed of" neurological events);  however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory.{{sfn|Searle|1992|loc=chpt. 5}}{{efn|Larry Hauser writes that "biological naturalism is either confused (waffling between identity theory and dualism) or else it ''just is'' identity theory or dualism."{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}}}} Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to [[Cartesian dualism]],{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different "substances". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}

===Consciousness===
Searle's original presentation emphasized "understanding"—that is, mental states with what philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"—and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as "consciousness". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}
{{quote|Computational models of consciousness are not sufficient by themselves for consciousness. The computational model for consciousness stands to consciousness in the same way the computational model of anything stands to the domain being modelled. Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London will leave us all wet. But they make the mistake of supposing that the computational model of consciousness is somehow conscious. It is the same mistake in both cases.{{sfn|Searle|2002}}|John R. Searle| Consciousness and Language, p. 16}}
[[David Chalmers]] writes "it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter" of the Chinese room.{{sfn|Chalmers|1996|p=322}}

[[Colin McGinn]] argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.{{sfn|McGinn|2000}}

Searle argues that this is only true for an observer ''outside'' of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone ''inside'' the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.

===Applied ethics===

[[File:USS Vincennes (CG-49) Aegis large screen displays.jpg|thumb|right|Sitting in the [[Operations room|Combat Information Center]] aboard [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|a warship]] – proposed as a real-life analog to the Chinese Room]]

Patrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military [[command and control]] systems if they are to preserve a commander's [[moral agency]]. He drew an analogy between a commander in their [[Operations room|command center]] and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of [[Nicomachean Ethics|Aristotle’s notions of "compulsory" and "ignorance"]]. Information could be "down converted" from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the [[Iran Air Flight 655|USS ''Vincennes'' incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Preserving a combat commander's moral agency: The Vincennes Incident as a Chinese Room|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227–235 |doi=10.1007/s10676-016-9408-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
The Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the [[philosophy of mind]], and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including [[physical symbol system|symbol processing]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[Turing completeness]], and the [[Turing test]].

===Strong AI vs. AI research===
Searle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers "don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The primary mission of [[artificial intelligence]] research is only to create useful systems that ''act'' intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is "merely" a simulation.

Searle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that ''acts'' more intelligently than a person, but does not have a [[mind]] or [[intentionality]] in the same way that [[Human brain|brains]] do. The Chinese room argument is not a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', rather it is an example that requires explanation. 

Searle's "strong AI" should not be confused with "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" as defined by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and other futurists,{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the ''amount'' of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.

===Turing test===
{{main article|Turing test}}
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing Test, in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player – A or B – is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination. Image adapted from Saygin, 2000.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]
The Chinese room implements a version of the [[Turing test]].{{sfn|Turing|1950}} [[Alan Turing]] introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question "can machines think?" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Turing then considered each possible objection to the proposal "machines can think", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of "consciousness" or "understanding". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:
{{quote|I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.{{sfn|Turing|1950}}}}

To Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[consciousness]], these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can [[behaviourism|behave]] or [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] as a conscious mind would.

===Symbol processing===
{{Main article|Physical symbol system}}
The Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] called this kind of machine a [[physical symbol system]]. It is also equivalent to the [[formal system]]s used in the field of [[mathematical logic]].

Searle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is [[syntax|syntactic]] (borrowing a term from the study of [[grammar]]). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of [[syntax|syntax rules]], without any knowledge of the symbol's [[semantics]] (that is, their [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]).

Newell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for "general intelligent action", or, as it is known today, [[artificial general intelligence]]. They framed this as a philosophical position, the [[physical symbol system|physical symbol system hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."{{sfn|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}} The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of "intelligent action", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.

===Chinese room and Turing completeness===
{{See also|Turing completeness|Church–Turing thesis}}
The Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a [[Von Neumann architecture]], which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a [[central processing unit|CPU]] which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in [[theoretical computer science]] as "[[Turing complete]]", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a [[Turing machine]] can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. [[Alan Turing]] writes, "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=442}} The widely accepted [[Church–Turing thesis]] holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.

The Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to [[Stevan Harnad]], are "no refutation (but rather an affirmation)"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}} of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that ''no'' digital computers can have a mind.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}

There are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.{{sfn|Ben-Yami|1993}}

==Complete argument==
Searle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Searle|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The wording of each axiom and conclusion are from Searle's presentation in ''[[Scientific American]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1990}}{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=5}} (A1-3) and (C1) are described as 1,2,3 and 4 in David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=5}}}} The only part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.{{efn|Paul and Patricia Churchland write that the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to "shore up axiom 3".{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990|p=34}}}}

He begins with three axioms:
:(A1) "Programs are formal ([[syntax|syntactic]])."
::A program uses [[syntax]] to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the [[semantics]] of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.

:(A2) "Minds have mental contents ([[semantics]])."
::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.

:(A3) "Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics."
::This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.

Searle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:

:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.

This much of the argument is intended to show that [[artificial intelligence]] can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the [[computational theory of mind]] correct?{{efn|name=Computationalism}} He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:

:(A4) Brains cause minds.

Searle claims that we can derive "immediately" and "trivially"{{sfn|Searle|1990}} that:

:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it "causal powers". "Causal powers" is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have "equivalent causal powers". "Equivalent causal powers" is whatever ''else'' that could be used to make a mind.

And from this he derives the further conclusions:

:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
::This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, it follows that programs do not have "equivalent causal powers."

:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
::Since programs do not have "equivalent causal powers", "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.

==Replies==
Replies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:{{efn|David Cole combines the second and third categories, as well as the fourth and fifth.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=5–6}}}}
* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way
* Those which contend that Searle's argument is misleading
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.

===Systems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===
These replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, ''where'' is the "mind" that does? These replies address the key [[ontological]] issues of [[mind/body problem|mind vs. body]] and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of "the system reply".

;System reply:The basic version argues that it is the "whole system" that understands Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=5–6}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=6–7}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=439}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by  [[Ned Block]], [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=6}}}}  While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. "Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part" Searle explains.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.

Searle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the "system" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to "the conjunction of that person and bits of paper"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are "under the grip of an ideology;"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing "system", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.

Searle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either because now "the system" and "the man" both describe exactly the same object.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} 

Critics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head.{{who|date=March 2011}} If we assume a "mind" is a form of information processing, then the [[theory of computation]] can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for [[Universal Turing machine|universal programmability]] (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials ''independently'' from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything ''including'' the specific program).{{sfn|Yee|1993|p=44|footnote=2}} The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's.{{sfn|Yee|1993|pp=42–47}} However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.

More sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what "the system" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies,{{who|date=March 2011}} the "mind that speaks Chinese" could be such things as: the "software", a "program", a "running program", a simulation of the "neural correlates of consciousness", the "functional system", a "simulated mind", an "[[strong emergence|emergent]] property", or "a [[virtual artifact|virtual]] mind" ([[Marvin Minsky]]'s version of the systems reply, described below).

;Virtual mind reply:The term "[[virtual artifact|virtual]]" is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist "in" a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects "inside" computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all "virtual", except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argues, a computer may contain a "mind" that is virtual in the same sense as [[virtual machine]]s, [[virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[virtual reality]].{{efn|The virtual mind reply is held by [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=7–9}} The reply was introduced by [[Marvin Minsky]].{{sfn|Minsky|1980|p=440}}{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=7}}}}

:To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple "virtual minds," thus the "system" cannot be the "mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=8}}

Searle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: "No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=12}} Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. "When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't ''really'' a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter."{{sfn|Fearn|2007|p=47}} The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article [[synthetic intelligence]].)

These replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something ''besides'' the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that "strong AI" is false.{{efn|David Cole writes "From the intuition that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room operator, then the inference is unsound."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=21}}}}

However, the thought experiment is not intended to be a reduction ad absurdum, but rather an example that requires explanation. Searle is not asserting that the situation is impossible, but rather that it is difficult or impossible to explain how this system can have subjection conscious experience.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=63|quote="the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition."}} The system reply succeeds in showing that it is ''not impossible'' but fails to show how the system would have consciousness; the replies, by themselves, provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the [[hypothetical]] premise that it passes the [[Turing Test]]. As Searle writes "the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}

===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===
As far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless "squiggles." But if the Chinese room really "understands" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about [[intentionality]], [[symbol grounding]] and [[syntax]] vs. [[semantic]]s.

;Robot reply:Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a "[[causality|causal]] connection" between the symbols and things they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=9–11}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Stevan Harnad]], [[Hans Moravec]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=9}}}} [[Hans Moravec]] comments: "If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| David Cole calls this the "externalist" account of meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}}}

:Searle's reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and ''does not know what the symbols mean.'' Searle writes "he doesn't ''see'' what comes into the robot's eyes."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} (See [[Mary's room]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Derived meaning: Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, ''is'' connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is "talking" to and through the programmers who designed the [[knowledge base]] in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates ''are already meaningful'', they're just not meaningful to ''him''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The derived meaning reply is associated with [[Daniel Dennett]] and others.}}

:Searle says that the symbols only have a "derived" meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.{{efn|Searle distinguishes between "intrinsic" intentionality and "derived" intentionality. "Intrinsic" intentionality is the kind that involves "conscious understanding" like you would have in a human mind. [[Daniel Dennett]] doesn't agree that there is a distinction. David Cole writes "derived intentionality is all there is, according to Dennett."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=19}}}}

;Commonsense knowledge / contextualist reply:Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast "background" of [[commonsense knowledge]] encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a "[[contextualism|context]]" that would give the symbols their meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}{{efn|David Cole describes this as the "internalist" approach to meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}} Proponents of this position include [[Roger Schank]], [[Doug Lenat]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and (with reservations) [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes "The fact is that any program [that passed a Turing test] would have to be an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge." {{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

:Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has also criticized the idea that the "background" can be represented symbolically.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1979|loc="The [[epistemological]] assumption"}}

To each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are [[syntax|syntactic]] and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes "syntax is insufficient for semantics."{{sfn|Searle|1984}}{{efn|Searle also writes "Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them."{{sfn|Motzkin|Searle|1989|p=45}}}}

However, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean ''to Searle'', what is important is what they mean ''to the virtual mind.'' While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that [[roboticist]]s can supply.

===Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room===
These arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular ''kind'' of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (Note that the "robot" and "commonsense knowledge" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)

;Brain simulator reply:Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=7–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=3–4}}; {{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The brain simulation replay has been made by [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=12}}}} This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.

:Searle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain—its causal and intentional states. [[John Searle|Searle]] is adamant that "human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} Moreover, he argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.

Now where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the "neuron firings" in his imagination.{{sfn|Searle|1980}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Two variations on the brain simulator reply are:
:;[[China brain]]:What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=4}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Early versions of this argument were put forward in 1974 by [[Lawrence Davis]] and in 1978 by [[Ned Block]]. Block's version used walkie talkies and was called the "Chinese Gym". Paul and Patricia Churchland described this scenario as well.{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}}} It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.

:;Brain replacement scenario:In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=956–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=20}}; {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|An early version of the brain replacement scenario was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-70s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] in 1980. [[Hans Moravec]] presented a vivid version of it,{{sfn|Moravec|1988}} and it is now associated with [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s version of [[transhumanism]].}} Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of your external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely outside of your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] [Y]our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1992}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ship of Theseus]] for a similar thought experiment.)
 
;Connectionist replies:Closely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding.{{efn|The connectionist reply is made by [[Andy Clark]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]],{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12 &amp; 17}} as well as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=7}}}}

;Combination reply:This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=8–9}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Many mansions/Wait till next year reply:Better technology in the future will allow computers to understand.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Searle|2009}} uses the name "Wait 'Til Next Year Reply".}} Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. His argument is that a machine using a program to manipulate formally defined elements can not produce understanding. Searle's argument, if correct, rules out only this particular design. Searle agrees that there may be other designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.

These arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.

In the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned.{{efn|Searle writes that the robot reply "tacitly concedes that cognition is not solely a matter of formal symbol manipulation." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} Stevan Harnad makes the same point, writing: "Now just as it is no refutation (but rather an affirmation) of the CRA to deny that [the Turing test] is a strong enough test, or to deny that a computer could ever pass it, it is merely special pleading to try to save computationalism by stipulating ad hoc (in the face of the CRA) that implementational details do matter after all, and that the computer's is the 'right' kind of implementation, whereas Searle's is the 'wrong' kind."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}}}} The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room ''could'' pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a "mind". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as "strong AI", proving his argument.

The brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} If computation does not provide an ''explanation'' of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.

Other critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle's description is correct, but ''misleading.'' By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).

In fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to ''weaken'' our intuitions. [[Ned Block]]'s [[Blockhead argument]]{{sfn|Block|1981}} suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple [[lookup table]] of [[Production system (computer science)|rules]] of the form "if the user writes ''S'', reply with ''P'' and goto X". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or "[[refactored]]") into this form, even a brain simulation.{{efn|That is, any program running on a machine with a finite amount memory.}} In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a [[memory address]]—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what "strong AI" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be ''extremely'' specific.

Searle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being ''simulated'' by a simple step by step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: "I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}}

===Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition===
The following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.

Several critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. [[Ned Block]] writes "Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading "[[intuition pump]]"{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}} and writes "Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it."{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}}

Some of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be "an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge", as [[Daniel Dennett]] explains.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}

;Speed and complexity replies:The speed at which human brains process information is (by some estimates) 100 billion operations per second.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=269}} Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=14–15}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–270}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Speed and complexity replies are made by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} Daniel Dennett points out the complexity of world knowledge.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

An especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]. They propose this analogous thought experiment:

;Churchland's luminous room:"Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!"{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} The problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=12}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=270}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=45–46}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stevan Harnad]] is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes "Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a [[phase transition]] into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ''[[ad hoc]]'' speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=7}}{{efn|Critics of the "phase transition" form of this argument include Stevan Harnad, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} This "phase transition" idea is a version of [[strong emergentism]] (what [[Daniel Dennett]] derides as "Woo woo West Coast emergence"{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=275}}). Harnad accuses [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] of espousing strong emergentism. Ray Kurzweil also holds a form of strong emergentism.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}}}}

Searle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the "system reply" as remotely plausible, a person must be "under the grip of an ideology".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any "system" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.

===Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness===&lt;!-- Linked to in a footnote above --&gt;

Several replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that  human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question.  He writes that we must "presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=10}} These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not "exist" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.

;Other minds reply:This reply points out that Searle's argument is a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own [[Turing test]]). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=4–5}}; {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The "other minds" reply has been offered by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Hans Moravec]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}}}

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes "If a program behaves ''as if''  it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying.  For all I know, Searle may only be behaving ''as if''  he were thinking deeply about these matters.  But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought."{{sfn|Nilsson|1984}}

[[Alan Turing]] anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called "The Argument from Consciousness") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply.{{sfn|Turing|1950|pp=11–12}} He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that "instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=11}} The [[Turing test]] simply extends this "polite convention" to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.{{efn|One of Turing's motivations for devising the [[Turing test]] is to avoid precisely the kind of philosophical problems that Searle is interested in. He writes "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery ... [but] I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper." {{sfn|Turing|1950|p=12}} Although Turing is discussing consciousness (not the mind or understanding or intentionality), Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that Turing's comments apply the Chinese room.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=952–953}}}}

; Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as [[eliminative materialism]]: the view that consciousness is a property that can be reduced to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it, a "[[user illusion]]".{{sfn|Dennett|1991|loc={{page needed|date=February 2011}}}}

:[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is  [[epiphenomenal]]: that it "casts no shadow", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the "knowability of the mental", and in his belief that there are "causal properties" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the [[Turing test]]—the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's "causal properties" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}}

[[Daniel Dennett]] provides this extension to the "epiphenomena" argument.
;Dennett's reply from natural selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's "causal properties" but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a "[[philosophical zombie|zombie]]" in thought experiments in the [[philosophy of mind]]). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Harnad|2005|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that "the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.

;[[Newton's flaming laser sword]] reply: [[Mike Alder]] argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-[[positivist]]: not only is the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''having'' a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.{{sfn|Alder|2004}}

==In popular culture==

The Chinese room argument is a central concept in [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]]'s novels ''[[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''Echopraxia''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Whitmarsh. (2016). “Imagine You're a Machine”: Narrative Systems in Peter Watts's Blindsight and Echopraxia. Science Fiction Studies, 43(2), 237-259. doi:10.5621/sciefictstud.43.2.0237&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a central theme in the video game ''[[Virtue's Last Reward]]'', and ties into the game's narrative.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Season 4 of the American crime drama ''[[Numb3rs]]'' there is a brief reference to the Chinese room.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[The Chinese Room]] is also the name of a British independent video game development studio best known for working on experimental first-person games, such as ''[[Everybody's Gone to the Rapture]]'', or ''[[Dear Esther]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/ |title=Home |website=The Chinese Room |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39437">'''Collaborative information seeking''' ('''CIS''') is a field of research that involves studying situations, motivations, and methods for people working in collaborative groups for information seeking projects, as well as building systems for supporting such activities. Such projects often involve information searching or [[information retrieval]] (IR), information gathering, and [[information sharing]]. Beyond that, CIS can extend to collaborative information synthesis and collaborative [[sense-making]].

==Background==
Seeking for information is often considered a solo activity, but there are many situations that call for people working together for [[information seeking]]. Such situations are typically complex in nature, and involve working through several sessions exploring, evaluating, and gathering relevant information. Take for example, a couple going on a trip. They have the same goal, and in order to accomplish their goal, they need to seek out several kinds of information, including flights, hotels, and sightseeing. This may involve them working together over multiple sessions, exploring and collecting useful information, and collectively making decisions that help them move toward their common goal.

It is a common knowledge that collaboration is either necessary or highly desired in many activities that are complex or difficult to deal with for an individual. Despite its natural appeal and situational necessity, collaboration in information seeking is an understudied domain. The nature of the available information and its role in our lives have changed significantly, but the methods and tools that are used to access and share that information in collaboration have remained largely unaltered. People still use general-purpose systems such as email and IM for doing CIS projects, and there is a lack of specialized tools and techniques to support CIS explicitly.

There are also several models to explain [[information seeking]] and [[information behavior]],&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. and Jansen, B. J. (2007) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/reddy_jansen_collaborative_information_searching.pdf A model for understanding collaborative information behavior in context: A study of two healthcare teams], Information Processing &amp; Management. 44 (1), 256-273.&lt;/ref&gt; but the areas of collaborative information seeking and collaborative information behavior remain understudied. On the theory side, Shah has presented C5 Model&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2008, June 20). Toward collaborative information seeking (CIS).

On the practical side, a few specialized systems for supporting CIS have emerged in the recent past, but their usage and evaluations have underwhelmed. Despite such limitations, the field of CIS has been getting a lot of attention lately, and several promising theories and tools have come forth. Multiple reviews of CIS related literature are written by Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Collaborative Information Seeking: A Literature Review, in Anne Woodsworth (ed.)

==Theories==
Depending upon what one includes or excludes while talking about CIS, we have many or hardly any theories. If we consider the past work on the [[groupware]] systems, many interesting insights can be obtained about people working on collaborative projects, the issues they face, and the guidelines for system designers. One of the notable works is by Grudin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grudin | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Groupware and social dynamics: eight challenges for developers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 92–105 | doi=10.1145/175222.175230}}&lt;/ref&gt; who laid out eight design principles for developers of [[groupware]] systems.

The discussion below is primarily based on some of the recent works in the field of computer supported cooperative work [[CSCW]], collaborative IR, and CIS.

===Definitions and terminology===
The literature is filled with works that use terms such as ''collaborative information retrieval'',&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, R., Bruce, H., Pejtersen, A. M., Dumais, S. T., Grudin, J., and Poltrock, S.

(2008). Toward Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS). In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; which are often used interchangeably.

There are several definitions of such related or similar terms in the literature. For instance, Foster&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. (2006). Collaborative information seeking and retrieval. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST), 40:329–356.&lt;/ref&gt; defined collaborative IR as ''"the study of the systems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, searching, and retrieval of information."'' Shah&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2009). Lessons and challenges for Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) systems developers. In Proceedings of GROUP 2009 Workshop on Collaborative Information Behavior, Sanibel Island, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; defined CIS as a process of collaboratively seeking information that is ''"defined explicitly among the participants, interactive, and mutually beneficial."'' While there is still a lack of a definition or a terminology that is universally accepted, but most agree that CIS is an active process, as opposed to [[collaborative filtering]], where a system connects the users based on their passive involvement (e.g., buying similar products on Amazon).

===Models of collaboration===
Foley and Smeaton&lt;ref name="fs2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = Colum | last2 = Smeaton | first2 = Alan F. | year = 2010 | title = Division of labour and sharing of knowledge for synchronous collaborative information retrieval | doi = 10.1016/j.ipm.2009.10.010 | journal = Inf. Process. Manage | volume = 46 | issue = 6| pages = 762–772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  defined two key aspects of collaborative information seeking as ''division of labor'' and the ''sharing of knowledge''. Division of labor allows collaborating searchers to tackle larger problems by reducing the duplication of effort (e.g., finding documents that one's collaborator has already discovered). The sharing of knowledge allows searchers to influence each other's activities as they interact with the retrieval system in pursuit of their (often evolving) information need. This influence can occur in real time if the collaborative search system supports it, or it can occur in a turn-taking, asynchronous manner if that is how interaction is structured.

[[Jaime Teevan|Teevan]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="tmb2009"&gt;Jaime Teevan, Meredith Ringel Morris, and Steve Bush. 2009. Discovering and using groups to improve personalized search. In Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '09), Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Paolo Boldi, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, and B. Barla Cambazoglu (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15-24. DOI=10.1145/1498759.1498786 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1498759.1498786&lt;/ref&gt;  characterized two classes of collaboration, task-based vs. trait-based. Task-based collaboration corresponds to intentional collaboration; trait-based collaboration facilitates the sharing of knowledge through inferred similarity of information need.

===Situations, motivations, and methods===
One of the important issues to study in CIS is the instance, reason, and the methods behind a collaboration. For instance, Morris,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"&gt;Morris, M. R. (2008). A survey of collaborative web search practices. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1657–1660, Florence, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; using a survey with 204 [[knowledge worker]]s at a large technology company found that people often like and want to collaborate, but they do not find specialized tools to help them in such endeavors. Some of the situations for doing collaborative information seeking in this survey were travel planning, shopping, and literature search. Shah,&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Working in Collaboration - What, Why, and How? Proceedings of Collaborative Information Retrieval workshop at CSCW 2010. Savannah, GA: February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, using personal interviews, identified three main reasons why people collaborate.
#''Requirement/setup''. Sometimes a group of people are "forced" to collaborate. Example includes a merger between two companies.
#''Division of labor''. Working together may help the participants to distribute the workload. Example includes a group of students working on a class project.
#''Diversity of skills''. Often people get together because they could not individually possess the required set of skills. Example includes co-authorship, where different authors bring different set of skills to the table.

As far as the tools and/or methods for CIS are concerned, both Morris and Shah found that email is still the most used tool. Other popular methods are face-to-face meetings, IM, and phone or conference calls. In general, the choice of the method or tool for our respondents depended on their situation (co-located or remote), and objective (brainstorming or working on independent parts).

===Space-time organization of CIS systems and methods===
The classical way of organizing collaborative activities is based on two factors: location and time.&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodden | first1 = T | year = 1991 | title = A Survey of CSCW Systems | url = | journal = Interacting with Computers | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 319–353 | doi=10.1016/0953-5438(91)90020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Hansen &amp; Jarvelin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = P. | last2 = Jarvelin | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Collaborative information retrieval in an information-intensive domain | url = | journal = Information Processing and Management | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1101–1119 | doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2004.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Golovchinsky, Pickens, &amp; Back&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Golovchinsky, G., Pickens, J., and Back, M. (2008b). A taxonomy of collaboration in online information seeking. In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; also classified approaches to collaborative IR using these two dimensions of space and time. See "Browsing is a Collaborative Process",&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.9584&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the authors depict various library activities on these two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B. and Nichols, D. M. (1996). Collaborative browsing and visualisation of the search process. In Proceedings of Aslib, volume 48, pages 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

As we can see from this figure, the majority of collaborative activities in conventional libraries are co-located and synchronous, whereas collaborative activities relating to digital libraries are more remote and synchronous. Social information filtering, or collaborative filtering, as we saw earlier, is a process benefitting from other users' actions in the past; thus, it falls under asynchronous and mostly remote domain. These days email also serves as a tool for doing asynchronous collaboration among users who are not co-located. Chat or IM (represented as 'internet' in the figure) helps to carry out synchronous and remote collaboration.

Rodden,&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"/&gt; similarly, presented a classification of CSCW systems using the form of interaction and the geographical nature of cooperative systems. Further, Rodden &amp; Blair&lt;ref&gt;Rodden, T. and Blair, G. (1991). CSCW and distributed systems: the problem of control. In Proceedings of ECSCW, pages 49–64, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; presented an important characteristic to all CSCW systems – control. According to the authors, two predominant control mechanisms have emerged within CSCW systems: speech act theory systems, and procedure based systems. These mechanisms are tightly coupled with the kind of control the system can support in a collaborative environment (discussed later).

Often researchers also talk about other dimensions, such as intentionality and depth of mediation (system mediated or user mediated),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while classifying various CIS systems.

===Control, communication, and awareness===
Three components specific to group-work or collaboration that are highly predominant in the CIS or CSCW literature are control, communication, and awareness. In this section key definitions and related works for these components will be highlighted. Understanding their roles can also help us address various design issues with CIS systems.

====Control====
Rodden identified the value of control in CSCW systems and listed a number of projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing for control. For instance, the COSMOS project&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, S. B. and Young, R. E. (1988). The COSMOS project: a multi-disciplinary approach to design of computer supported group working. In Speth, R., editor, EUTECO 88: Research into Networks and Distributed Applications, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; had a formal structure to represent control in the system. They used roles to represent people or automatons, and rules to represent the flow and processes. Roles of the people could be supervisor, processor, or analyst. Rules could be a condition that a process needs to satisfy in order to start or finish. Due to such a structure seen in projects like COSMOS, Rodden classified these control systems as procedural based systems.

====Communication====
This is one of the most critical components of any collaboration. In fact, Rodden (1991) identified message or communication systems as the class of systems in CSCW that is most mature and most widely used.

Since the focus here is on CIS systems that allow its participants to engage in an intentional and interactive collaboration, there must be a way for the participants to communicate with each other. What is interesting to note is that often, collaboration could begin by letting a group of users communicate with each other. For instance, Donath &amp; Robertson&lt;ref&gt;Donath, J. S. and Robertson, N. (1994). The sociable web. In Proceedings of WWW Conference, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a system that allows a user to know that others were currently viewing the same webpage and communicate with those people to initiate a possible collaboration or at least a co-browsing experience. Providing communication capabilities even in an environment that was not originally designed for carrying out collaboration is an interesting way of encouraging collaboration.

====Awareness====
Awareness, in the context of CSCW, has been defined as ''"an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity"''.&lt;ref&gt;Dourish, P. and Bellotti, V. (1992). Awareness and coordination in shared workspaces. In Proceedings of ACM CSCW, pages 107–114, Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt; The following four kinds of awareness are often discussed and addressed in the CSCW literature:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liechti | first1 = O. | last2 = Sumi | first2 = Y. | year = 2002 | title = Awareness and the WWW | url = | journal = International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1006/ijhc.2001.0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Group awareness.'' This kind of awareness includes providing information to each group member about the status and activities of the other collaborators at a given time.
#''Workspace awareness.'' This refers to a common workspace that the group has where they can bring and discuss their findings, and create a common product.
#''Contextual awareness.'' This type of awareness relates to the application domain, rather than the users. Here, we want to identify what content is useful for the group, and what the goals are for the current project.
#''Peripheral awareness.'' This relates to the kind of information that has resulted from personal and the group's collective history, and should be kept separate from what a participant is currently viewing or doing.

Shah and Marchionini&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., &amp; Marchionini, G. (2010). Awareness in Collaborative Information Seeking. Journal of American Society of Information Science and Technology (JASIST), 61(10), 1970-1986.&lt;/ref&gt; studied awareness as provided by interface in collaborative information seeking. They found that one needs to provide "right" (not too little, not too much, and appropriate for the task at hand) kind of awareness to reduce the cost of coordination and maximize the benefits of collaboration.

==Systems==
A number of specialized systems have been developed back from the days of the [[groupware]] systems to today's Web 2.0 interfaces. A few such examples, in chronological order, are given below.

===Ariadne===
Twidale et al.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B., Nichols, D. M., and Paice, C. D. (1995). Supporting collaborative learning during information searching. In Proceedings of Computer Supported Col- laborative Learning (CSCL), pages 367–374, Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; developed Ariadne to support the collaborative learning of database browsing skills. In addition to enhancing the opportunities and effectiveness of the collaborative learning that already occurred, Ariadne was designed to provide the facilities that would allow collaborations to persist as people increasingly searched information remotely and had less opportunity for spontaneous face-to-face collaboration.

Ariadne was developed in the days when Telnet-based access to library catalogs was a common practice. Building on top of this command-line interface, Ariadne could capture the users’ input and the database’s output, and form them into a search history that consisted of a series of command-output pairs. Such a separation of capture and display allowed Ariadne to work with various forms of data capture methods.

To support complex browsing processes in collaboration, Ariadne presented a visualization of the search process.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~twidale/irinterfaces/ariadne.gif&lt;/ref&gt; This visualization consisted of thumbnails of screens, looking like playing cards, which represented command-output pairs. Any such card can be expanded to reveal its details. The horizontal axis on Ariadne’s display represented time, and the vertical axis showed information on the semantics of the action it represented: the top row for the top level menus, the middle row for specifying a search, and the bottom row for looking at particular book details.

This visualization of the search process in Ariadne makes it possible to annotate, discuss with colleagues around the screen, and distribute to remote collaborators for asynchronous commenting easily and effectively. As we saw in the previous section, having access to one’s history as well as the history of one’s collaborators are very crucial to effective collaboration. Ariadne implements these requirements with the features that let one visualize, save, and share a search process. In fact, the authors found one of the advantages of search visualization was the ability to recap previous searching sessions easily in a multi-session exploratory searching.

===SearchTogether===
More recently, one of the collaborative information seeking tools that have caught a lot of attention is SearchTogether, developed by Morris and [[Eric Horvitz|Horvitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. R. and Horvitz, E. (2007). SearchTogether: An Interface for Collaborative Web Search. In ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), pages 3–12, Newport, RI.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of this tool was motivated by a survey that the researchers did with 204 knowledge workers,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"/&gt; in which they discovered the following.
* A majority of respondents wanted to collaborate while searching on the Web.
* The most common ways of collaborating in information seeking tasks are sending emails back and forth, using IM to exchange links and query terms, and using phone calls while looking at a Web browser.
* Some of the most popular Web searching tasks on which people like to collaborate are planning travels or social events, making expensive purchases, researching medical conditions, and looking for information related to a common project.

Based on the survey responses, and the current and desired practices for collaborative search, the authors of SearchTogether identified three key features for supporting people’s collaborative information behavior while searching on the Web: awareness, division of labor, and persistence. Let us look at how these three features are implemented.

SearchTogether instantiates ''awareness'' in several ways, one of which is per-user query histories. This is done by showing each group member’s screen name, his/her photo and queries in the “Query Awareness” region. The access to the query histories is immediate and interactive, as clicking on a query brings back the results of that query from when it was executed. The authors identified query awareness as a very important feature in collaborative searching, which allows group members to not only share their query terms, but also learn better query formulation techniques from one another.

Another component of SearchTogether that facilitates awareness is the display of page-specific metadata. This region includes several pieces of information about the displayed page, including group members who viewed the given page, and their comments and ratings. The authors claim that such visitation information can help one either choose to avoid a page already visited by someone in the group to reduce the duplication of efforts, or perhaps choose to visit such pages, as they provide a sign of promising leads as indicated by the presence of comments and/or ratings.

''Division of labor'' in SearchTogether is implemented in three ways: (1) “Split Search” allows one to split the search results among all online group members in a round-robin fashion, (2) “Multi-Engine Search” takes a query and runs it on n different search engines, where ''n'' is the number of online group members, (3) manual division of labor can be facilitated using integrated IM.

Finally, the ''persistence'' feature in SearchTogether is instantiated by storing all the objects and actions, including IM conversations, query histories, recommendation queues, and page-specific metadata. Such data about all the group members are available to each member when he/she logs in. This allows one to easily carry a multi-session collaborative project.

===Cerchiamo===

Cerchiamo&lt;ref name="pgsqb08"&gt;Jeremy Pickens, Gene Golovchinsky, Chirag Shah, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. 2008. Algorithmic mediation for collaborative exploratory search. In Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 315-322. DOI=10.1145/1390334.1390389 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1390334.1390389
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gapqb08"&gt;Gene Golovchinsky, John Adcock, Jeremy Pickens, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. CerchiamoL a collaborative exploratory search tool. Demo presented at the 2008 ACM conference on computer supported cooperative work (CSCW 2008), San Diego, CA, November 08–12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collaborative information seeking tool that explores issues related to algorithmic mediation of information seeking activities and how collaborators' roles can be used to structure the user interface. Cerchiamo introduced the notion of algorithmic mediation, that is, the ability of the system to collect input asynchronously from multiple collaborating searchers, and to use these multiple streams of input to affect the information that is being retrieved and displayed to the searchers.

Cerchiamo collected judgments of relevance from multiple collaborating searchers and used those judgments to create a ranked list of items that were potentially relevant to the information need. This algorithm prioritized items that were retrieved by multiple queries and that were retrieved by queries that also retrieved many other relevant documents. This rank fusion is just one way in which a search system that manages activities of multiple collaborating searchers can combine their inputs to generate results that are better than those produced by individuals working independently.

Cerchiamo implemented two roles&amp;mdash;Prospector and Miner&amp;mdash;that searchers could assume. Each role had an associated interface. The Prospector role/interface focused on running many queries and making a few judgments of relevance for each query to explore the information space. The Miner role/interface focused on making relevance judgments on a ranked list of items selected from items retrieved by all queries in the current session. This combination of roles allowed searchers to explore and exploit the information space, and led teams to discover more unique relevant documents than pairs of individuals working separately.&lt;ref name="pgsqb08" /&gt;

===Coagmento===
[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] (Latin for "working together") is a new and unique system that allows a group of people work together for their information seeking tasks without leaving their browsers. [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] has been developed with a client-server architecture, where the client is implemented as a Firefox plug-in that helps multiple people working in collaboration to communicate, and search, share and organize information. The server component stores and provides all the objects and actions collected from the client. Due to this decoupling, [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] provides a flexible architecture that allows its users to be co-located or remote, working synchronously or asynchronously, and use different platforms.

[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] includes a toolbar and a sidebar. The toolbar has several buttons that helps one collect information and be aware of the progress in a given collaboration. The toolbar has three major parts:
* ''Buttons for collecting information and making annotations.'' These buttons help one save or remove a webpage, make annotations on a webpage, and highlight and collect text snippets.
* ''Page-specific statistics.'' The middle portion of the toolbar shows various statistics, such as the number of views, annotations, and snippets, for the displayed page. A user can click on a given statistic and obtain more information. For instance, clicking on the number of snippets will bring up a window that shows all the snippets collected by the collaborators from the displayed page.
* ''Project-specific statistics.'' The last portion of the toolbar displays task/project name and various statistics, including number of pages visited and saved, about the current project. Clicking on that portion brings up the workspace where one can view all the collected objects (pages and snippets) brought in by the collaborators for that project.

The sidebar features a chat window, under which there are three tabs with the history of search engine queries, saved pages and snippets. With each of these objects, the user who created or collected that object is shown. Anyone in the group can access an object by clicking on it. For instance, one can click on a query issued by anyone in the group to re-run that query and bring up the results in the main browser window.

An [[Android (operating system)]] app for Coagmento can be found in the [https://market.android.com/details?id=com.coagmento.mobile Android Market].

===Cosme===
Fernandez-Luna et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Luna, J. M., Huete, J. F., Perez-Vazquez, R., Rodriguez-Cano, J. C., and Shah, C. (2010). COSME: A NetBeans IDE plug-in as a team-centric alternative for search driven software development. In Proceedings of GROUP 2010 Workshop on Collaborative Information Seeking, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce Cosme (COde Search MEeting) as a NetBeans IDE plug-in that enables remote team of software developers to collaborate in real time during source-code search sessions. The COSME design was motivated by early stadies of C. Foley, M. R. Morris, C. Shah, among others researchers, and by habits of software developers identified in a survey of 117 universities students and professors related with projects of software development, as well as to computer programmers of some companies. The five more commons collaborative search habits (or related to it) of the interviewees was:

* Revision of problems by the team in the workstation of one of them.
* Suggest addresses of Web pages that they have already visited previously, digital books stored in some FTP, or source files of a version control system.
* Send emails with algorithms or explanatory text.
* Division of search tasks among each member of the team for sharing the final result.
* Store relevant information in individual workstation.

COSME is designed to enable either synchronous or asynchronous, but explicit remote collaboration among team developers with shared technical information needs. Its client user interface include a search panel that lets developers to specify queries, division of labor principle (possible combination include the use of different search engines, ranking fusion, and split algorithms), searching field (comments, source-code, class or methods declaration), and the collection type (source-code files or digital documentation). The sessions panel wraps the principal options to management the collaborative search sessions, which consists in a team of developers working together to satisfy their shared technical information needs. For example, a developer can use the embedded chat room to negotiate the creation of a collaborative search session, and show comments of the current and historical search results. The implementation of Cosme was based on CIRLab (Collaborative Information Retrieval Laboratory) instantiation, a groupware framework for CIS research and experimentation, Java as programming language, NetBeans IDE Platform as plug-in base, and Amenities (A MEthodology for aNalysis and desIgn of cooperaTIve systEmS) as software engineering methodology.

==Open-source application frameworks and toolkits==
CIS systems development is a complex task, which involves software technologies and Know-how  in different areas such as distributed programming, information search and retrieval, collaboration among people, task coordination and many others according to the context. This situation is not ideal because it requires great programming efforts. Fortunately, some CIS application frameworks and toolkits are increasing their popularity since they have a high reusability impact for both developers and researchers, like Coagmento Collaboratory and DrakkarKeel.

The '''Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies''', formerly the '''Institute of Jewish Studies''', is a center devoted to [[Judaic studies]] in [[Nanjing]], [[China]]. It is associated with the Department of [[Religious Studies]] of [[Nanjing University]].

The institute was founded in May 1992, a few months after the establishment of diplomatic relations between [[Israel]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] in January of that year. It offers courses in Jewish studies which now enroll over 200 students each year, has published a one-volume Chinese version of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', and other publications. It has now established both masters and Ph.D. program in Jewish studies, the only Chinese institution to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Open New Chapter With the People of the Book" ''The Forward'' April 20, 2007, p. A1-B2 [http://www.forward.com/articles/10542/]&lt;/ref&gt; It held an  International Seminar on Holocaust and Genocide in World War II on August 7–12, 2005, in Nanjing.

It was given its present name after the construction of a quarters for it from the [[Guilford Glazer|Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation]] in a new building at the University in 2006. It is planned that it will become part of  a larger Nanjing University–[[Johns Hopkins University]] Institute for International Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">In [[botany]], a '''diaspore''' is a plant dispersal unit consisting of a [[seed]] or [[spore]] plus any additional tissues that assist dispersal.  In some [[seed plants]], the diaspore is a seed and fruit together, or a seed and [[elaiosome]]. In a few seed plants, the diaspore is most or all of the plant, and is known as a [[tumbleweed]].

Diaspores are common in [[weed]]y and [[ruderal species]].  Collectively, diaspores, seeds, and spores that have been modified for migration are known as ''disseminules''.

==Role in dispersal==
A diaspore of seed plus elaiosome is a common adaptation to [[seed dispersal]] by ants ([[myrmecochory]]).  This is most notable in [[Australia]]n and [[South Africa]]n [[sclerophyll]] plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, ants carry the diaspore to their nest, where they may eat the elaiosome and discard the seed, and the seed may subsequently [[germination|germinate]].

[[File:A Taraxacum Ruderalia dandelion clock.jpg|thumb|Achenes of a dandelion (''[[Taraxacum]]'')]]
A diaspore of seed(s) plus fruit is common in plants dispersed by [[frugivore]]s. Fruit-eating bats typically carry the diaspore to a favorite perch, where they eat the fruit and discard the seed.  Fruit-eating birds typically swallow small seeds but, like bats, may carry larger seeded fruits to a perch where they eat the fruit and discard the seed.  Diaspores such as [[achene]]s and [[Samara (fruit)|samara]]e are dispersed primarily by [[wind]];  samaras are dispersed also by sailing or tumbling as they fall in still air.  [[Drift fruit]]s and some others are dispersed by water.

[[Tumbleweed]]s are dispersed by wind, sometimes over very long distances.  These occur in a variety of [[weed]]y and [[ruderal species]] native to [[steppe]]s and [[desert]]s. [[Grass]]es have various units of dispersal: rarely the [[caryopsis]] alone, often a diaspore.&lt;ref name=Gibson2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gibson | first =  David J.| year = 2009| title = Grasses and grassland ecology| pages = 52| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5UqVtp0vWKYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=tumbleweed+like+dispersal| isbn = 0-19-852919-8| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disarticulation occurs below, between, or above the [[glume]]s and at all nodes.&lt;ref name=Gibson2009/&gt;  Although in some species the diaspore is a [[foxtail (diaspore)|foxtail]], in a few (the "tumble grasses") it is like a tumbleweed.

'''Dielectric loss''' quantifies a [[dielectric material]]'s inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be parameterized in terms of either the '''loss angle''' ''δ'' or the corresponding '''loss tangent''' tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  Both refer to the [[phasor]] in the [[complex plane]] whose real and imaginary parts are the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] (lossless) counterpart.

==Electromagnetic field perspective==

For time varying electromagnetic fields, the electromagnetic energy is typically viewed as waves propagating either through free space, in a [[transmission line]], in a [[microstrip]] line, or through a [[waveguide]].  Dielectrics are often used in all of these environments to mechanically support electrical conductors and keep them at a fixed separation, or to provide a barrier between different gas pressures yet still transmit electromagnetic power.  [[Maxwell’s equations]] are solved for the electric and magnetic field components of the propagating waves that satisfy the boundary conditions of the specific environment's geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=S. |last1=Ramo |first2=J.R. |last2=Whinnery |first3=T. |last3=Van Duzer |title=Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |date=1994 |ISBN=0-471-58551-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such electromagnetic analyses, the parameters [[permittivity]] ''ε'', [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] ''μ'', and [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''σ'' represent the properties of the media through which the waves propagate.  The permittivity can have real and imaginary components (the latter excluding ''σ'' effects, see below) such that

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon' - j \varepsilon'' &lt;/math&gt; .

If we assume that we have a wave function such that

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E = \mathbf E_{o}e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;,

then Maxwell's curl equation for the magnetic field can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf H = j \omega \varepsilon' \mathbf E + ( \omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma )\mathbf E &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε′′'' is the imaginary component of permittivity attributed to ''bound'' charge and dipole relaxation phenomena, which gives rise to energy loss that is indistinguishable from the loss due to the ''free'' charge conduction that is quantified by ''σ''.  The component ''ε′'' represents the familiar lossless permittivity given by the product of the ''free space'' permittivity and the ''relative'' real/absolute permittivity, or ''ε′''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ε′''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.  The '''loss tangent''' is then defined as the ratio (or angle in a complex plane) of the lossy reaction to the electric field '''E''' in the curl equation to the lossless reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac{\omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma} {\omega \varepsilon'} &lt;/math&gt; .

For dielectrics with small loss, this angle is ≪&amp;nbsp;1 and tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  After some further calculations to obtain the solution for the fields of the electromagnetic wave, it turns out that the power decays with propagation distance ''z'' as
:&lt;math&gt;P = P_o e^{-\delta k z}&lt;/math&gt;, where:
:*''P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial power,
:*&lt;math&gt;k = \omega \sqrt{\mu \varepsilon'} = \tfrac {2 \pi} {\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;,
:*''ω'' is the angular frequency of the wave, and
:*''λ'' is the wavelength in the dielectric material.

There are often other contributions to power loss for electromagnetic waves that are not included in this expression, such as due to the wall currents of the conductors of a transmission line or waveguide. Also, a similar analysis could be applied to the magnetic permeability where

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \mu' - j \mu'' &lt;/math&gt; ,

with the subsequent definition of a '''magnetic loss tangent'''

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta_m = \frac{\mu''} {\mu'} &lt;/math&gt; .

The electric loss tangent can be similarly defined:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vmUdUXlBNIC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;f=false|first1= L. F. |last1=Chen |first2=C. K. |last2=Ong |first3=C. P. |last3=Neo |first4=V. V. |last4=Varadan |first5=Vijay K. |last5=Varadan|title=Microwave Electronics: Measurement and Materials Characterization|at=eq. (1.13)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta_e = \frac{\varepsilon''} {\varepsilon'} &lt;/math&gt;,

upon introduction of an effective dielectric conductivity (see [[relative permittivity#Lossy medium]]).

==Discrete circuit perspective==

For every discrete electrical circuit components, a [[capacitor]] is typically made of a dielectric placed between conductors.  The [[lumped element model]] of a capacitor includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), as shown in the figure below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliablecapacitors.com/consider.htm |title=Considerations for a High Performance Capacitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESR represents losses in the capacitor.  In a low-loss capacitor the ESR is very small (the conduction is low leading to a high resistivity), and in a lossy capacitor the ESR can be large.  Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]].  The ESR is a derived quantity representing the loss due to both the dielectric's conduction electrons and the bound dipole relaxation phenomena mentioned above.  In a dielectric, one of the conduction electrons or the [[Dielectric spectroscopy#Dipole relaxation|dipole relaxation]] typically dominates loss in a particular dielectric and manufacturing method.  For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega^2 C} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the lossless capacitance.

[[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]]

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's '''loss tangent''' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram.  The loss tangent is then

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac {\mathrm{ESR}} {|X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega} &lt;/math&gt; .

Since the same [[alternating current|AC]] current flows through both ''ESR'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', the loss tangent is also the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor.  For this reason, a capacitor's loss tangent is sometimes stated as its ''[[dissipation factor]]'', or the reciprocal of its ''[[quality factor]] Q'', as follows

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \mathrm{DF} = \frac {1} {Q} &lt;/math&gt;  .

'''''Digging for the Truth''''' is a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] [[television series]]. The first three seasons of the show focused on host [[Josh Bernstein]], who journeyed on various explorations of historical icons and mysteries. Bernstein is the president and [[CEO]] of [[Boulder Outdoor Survival School|BOSS (Boulder Outdoor Survival School)]] and has a degree in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]] from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questmagazine.com/z_tonya_morrison_qm200607_s2-digging-for-the-truth-josh-bernstein-history-channel.html Josh Bernstein: Explorer and Anthropologist - Yes; Indiana Jones - No], QuestMagazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; The show airs every Monday night at 9:00 EST on the History Channel. The series premiered in January 2005 and at the time was the highest-rated series currently running on The History Channel, which was surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} given the previous show ''Time Titans'' from the production crew never made it past the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/March06/JoshBernstein.lgk.html |title=Josh Bernstein profile |last=Grace-Kobas |first=Linda |date=March 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third season premiered on January 22, 2007, with a two-hour special event on the quest for [[Atlantis]].

Bernstein announced on February 20, 2007, that he would be leaving The History Channel and ''Digging for the Truth'', and would, as of April, join [[The Discovery Channel]] as an [[executive producer]] and host of a new prime-time series and specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/josh-bernstein-joins-discovery-channel-to-create-world-premiere-series-and-specials-58026742.html |title=Josh Bernstein Joins Discovery Channel to Create World Premiere Series and Specials |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Ellis]], host of ''[[Tactical to Practical]]'' and ''[[Man, Moment, Machine]]'' for The History Channel, then replaced Bernstein as host.

Each episode typically deals with an event or subject in history that is not completely understood by modern historians. As such, many of the topics covered are controversial in some respect. Bernstein usually mentioned the various theories that exist on the subject, although the episode may not have explored all of them. He then traveled to various locations to ask questions of researchers, and he often he put himself into situations (e.g. working in a quarry, climbing a rock-face) that simulated the activities of people in the period he explored. Almost all of the researchers he talked to were professionals in the subject at hand, and many of the places he visited (e.g., the inside of a pyramid) are not open to the general public. At the end of each episode, he pulled together everything discussed in the episode to either formulate a hypothesis of what happened or to conclude that what happened remains a mystery.

In late 2006, Bernstein's book ''Digging for the Truth: One Man's Epic Adventure Exploring the World's Greatest Archaeological Mysteries'' was published. In the book, Bernstein writes a bit about his past and BOSS, but it is mostly a behind-the-scene look at various episodes.

A '''double bass array''' (DBA) is a specific layout of [[Subwoofer|subwoofers]] within a rectangular listening space. It removes unwanted room related resonances ([[Room modes|modes]]) over a wide listening area.

== Preface ==
A DBA requires at least two subwoofers (preferably same make and model) that are placed at opposing walls in a specific layout. The subwoofer array on the back wall is inverted and delayed based on the distance to the frontal subwoofer array. This will actively "absorb" any reflected sound.

== Design ==
=== Array layout ===
[[File:DBA4.PNG|thumb|Common configuration with 4 subwoofer]]
Modes between side walls, floor and ceiling are suppressed by arranging the subwoofer in a specific grid:

&lt;math&gt;p_x {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_x}{2 \cdot a_x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_y {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_y}{2 \cdot a_y}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:DBA Wellenfront.png|thumb|Top view of an array with 2 subwoofer. The walls create mirror sources which results in a plane wave.]]
With this specific grid layout reflections from the walls act as mirror sources. Interference of the subwoofers and mirror sources create a plane wave up to a certain frequency. The more sources the higher the frequency. This cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for each dimension as follows:

&lt;math&gt;f_c {=} \frac{c}{2 \cdot d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;: Distance between subwoofers

Example: A 4 × 4 array on a wall measuring 4 × 3 m would work up to 86Hz horizontally and up to 114Hz vertically.

=== Active Absorption ===
[[File:DBA Wellenfront2.png|thumb|Schematic of active absorption. The bass signal is shown as a  transversal wave. The frontal wave is reflected at the back wall. At the same time the back array sends out an inverted wave which cancels the reflection.]]
Due to the specific grid layout of the subwoofer array most modal effects are suppressed. The length modes on the other hand get fully excited. The array on the back wall will emit a polarity inverted wave at the very same moment the wave from the front wall hits the back wall. Reflection and inverted wave will interfere with each other destructively so the reflection is canceled. This is also known as "active absorption".

The necessary delay &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt; of the back array is based on the length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of the room:

&lt;math&gt;t_d {=} \frac{l}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

The necessary delay required for a DBA is available in most digital equalizers or digital crossovers. Polarity of the back array can easily be achieved by inverting the signal coming from the amps or by swapping the cables going to the driver. Most active subwoofers also offer a polarity switch.

== Pros ==
* Sound pressure level throughout the room is very even.
* Modal resonances are reduced to a minimum.
* Subwoofers should be placed as close as possible on the wall where they easily can be made invisible.
* No bulky acoustic room treatments or even structural modifications necessary.
* Simple setup.

== Cons ==
* Rooms properties and furniture can interfere with the propagation of the plane wave.
* Frequency range of the plane wave depends on the number of drivers which can be quite high in large rooms.
* As the back wall array is only used to cancel the energy of the frontal array the overall efficiency isn't good.
* SPL throughout the room is virtually constant which might affect tonal balance with satellite speakers that fall off with listening distance.

== Notes ==
A DBA just requires two opposing walls so it's possible to have one array on the floor and the other on the ceiling or one on the left wall and the other on the right. Low frequencies become localizable at a specific frequency though so in most cases it's probably a good idea to use the front wall and the back wall.

It largely depends on the room how good a DBA will work.
* The room should be rectangular
* Walls should be rigid
* Measuring equipment helps to dial in the necessary delay

'''Earth sheltering''' is the architectural practice of using [[soil|earth]] against building walls for external [[thermal mass]], to reduce heat loss, and to easily maintain a steady indoor air temperature. Earth sheltering has become relatively more popular in modern times, especially among [[environmentalists]] and advocates of [[passive solar]] and [[sustainable architecture]].  However, the practice has been around for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.

==Definition==
The expression earth-sheltering is a generic term, with the general meaning: ''building design in which soil plays an integral part''.

A building can be described as earth-sheltered if its external envelope is in contact with a thermally significant volume of soil or substrate (where “thermally significant” means making a functional contribution to the thermal effectiveness of the building in question.)

Earth-sheltered buildings consist of one or more of three types: earth-covered, earth-bunded, and subterranean.  An earth-covered building is one where the thermally effective element is placed solely on the roof, but is more usually a continuation of the earth-bunding at the unexposed elevations of the building.  An earth-bunded building is one where the thermally significant element insulates one or more of the sheltered elevations of the building.  The bunding can be partial or total.  A subterranean building is one where the thermally significant element insulates all elevations of the building, leaving only the roof exposed;  or, if the building is built into an incline, it may be that the roof is covered and only one elevation is left exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Harrall. J. 2007. Demonstrating the Viability and Growing Acceptability of Earth-Sheltered Buildings in the UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Living in earth shelters has been a large part of human history.
The connection to earth shelter dwellings began with the utilization of caves, and over time evolving technologies led to the construction of customized earth dwellings. Today, earth shelter construction is a rare practice, especially in the U.S.A. During the energy crisis and the [[1973 Oil Crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/2006-10-01/Earth-sheltered-Homes.aspx|title=Earth-sheltered Homes|work=Mother Earth News}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[back-to-the-land movement]], there was a surge of interest in earth shelter/underground home construction in an effort toward self-sufficient living. However, progress has been slow, and earth shelter construction is often viewed by architects, engineers, and the public alike as an unconventional method of building. Techniques of earth sheltering have not yet become common knowledge, and much of society still remains unaware of the process or benefits of this type of building construction.

==Types of construction==
[[File:Cabaña subterránea en la región de Búðahraun, Vesturland, Islandia, 2014-08-14, DD 046.JPG|thumbnail|Example of an abandoned [[Iceland]]ic turf house in the region of {{Interlanguage link multi|Búðahraun|is}} via earth berming]]
* '''Earth berming:'''  Earth is piled up against exterior walls and packed, sloping down away from the house. The roof may or may not be fully earth covered, and windows/openings may occur on one or more sides of the shelter. Due to the building being above ground, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully recessed construction.
* '''In-hill construction:'''  The house is set into a slope or hillside. The most practical application is using a hill facing towards the equator (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). There is only one exposed wall in this type of earth sheltering, the wall facing out of the hill, all other walls are embedded within the earth/hill.
* '''Underground/fully recessed construction:'''  The ground is excavated, and the house is set in below grade. It can also be referred to as an [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]] style due to the common atrium/courtyard constructed in the middle of the shelter to provide adequate light and ventilation.

==Benefits==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Addison Sod House]] --&gt;
The benefits of earth sheltering are numerous. They include usage of the earth as a thermal mass, extra protection from the natural elements, energy savings, substantial privacy in comparison to more conventional homes, efficient use of land in urban settings, low maintenance requirements, and the ability to take advantage of [[passive solar building design]].

The Earth's mass absorbs and retains heat. Over time, this heat is released to surrounding areas, such as an earth shelter. Because of the high density of the earth, change in the earth’s temperature occurs slowly. This is known as ‘thermal lag.’ Because of this principle, the earth provides a fairly constant temperature for the underground shelters, even when the outdoor temperature undergoes great fluctuation.  In most of the [[United States]], the average temperature of the earth once below the [[frost line]] is between 55 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 14 degrees Celsius). Frost line depths vary from region to region. In the USA frost lines can range from just under the surface to more than 40&amp;nbsp; inches.  Thus, at the base of a deep earth [[berm]], the house is heated against an exterior temperature gradient of perhaps ten to fifteen degrees, instead of against a steeper temperature grade where the air is on the outside of the wall instead of earth. During the summer, the temperature gradient helps to cool the house.

The reduction of air infiltration within an earth shelter can be highly profitable. Because three walls of the structure are mainly surrounded by earth, very little surface area is exposed to the outside air. This alleviates the problem of warm air escaping the house through gaps around windows and door. Furthermore, the earth walls protect against cold winter winds which might otherwise penetrate these gaps. However, this can also become a potential indoor air quality problem. Healthy air circulation is key.

As a result of the increased [[thermal mass]] of the structure, the [[thermal lag]] of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for extra heating and cooling is minimal. Therefore, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption required for the home compared to homes of typical construction.

Earth shelters also provide privacy from neighbors, as well as soundproofing. The ground provides acoustic protection against outside noise. This can be a major benefit in urban areas or near highways. In urban areas, another benefit of underground sheltering is the efficient use of land. Many houses can sit below grade without spoiling the habitat above ground. Each site can contain both a house and a lawn/garden.

==Potential problems==
Problems of water seepage, internal [[condensation]], bad acoustics, and poor indoor air quality can occur if an earth shelter has not been properly designed.

Issues also include the sustainability of building materials. Earth sheltering often requires heavier construction than conventional building techniques, and many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth-sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs.

The threat of water seepage occurs around areas where the waterproofing layers have been penetrated. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due to the possibility of movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2&amp;nbsp; inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the waterproofing layer. To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment of the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.

The building materials for earth-sheltered construction tend to be of non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often made of plastics. Concrete is another material that is used in great quantity. More sustainable products are being tested to replace the [[cement]] within concrete (such as [[fly ash]]), as well as alternatives to reinforced concrete (see more under Materials: Structural). The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.

Condensation and poor quality indoor air problems can be solved by using earth tubes, or what is known as a [[geothermal heat pump]]—a concept different from earth sheltering. With modification, the idea of earth tubes can be used for underground buildings: instead of looping the earth tubes, leave one end open downslope to draw in fresh air using the chimney effect by having exhaust vents placed high in the underground building.

==Landscape and site planning==
The [[site planning]] for an earth-sheltered building is an integral part of the overall design; investigating the landscape of a potential building site is crucial. There are many factors to assess when surveying a site for underground construction. The topography, regional climate, vegetation, water table and [[soil type]] of varying landscapes all play dynamic roles in the design and application of earth shelters.

===Topography===
On land that is relatively flat, a fully recessed house with an open courtyard is the most appropriate design. On a sloping site, the house is set right into the hill. The slope will determine the location of the window wall; a south-facing exposed wall is the most practical in the Northern hemisphere (and north-facing in the Southern hemisphere) due to solar benefits.  The most practical house design in the tropics (and with equal advantage in both hemispheres) is that the two shorter walls on the ends be exposed, one facing east and the other facing west.

===Regional climate===
Depending on the region and site selected for earth-sheltered construction, the benefits and objectives of the earth shelter construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.

Regions with extreme daily and seasonal temperatures emphasize the value of earth as a thermal mass. In this way, earth sheltering is most effective in regions with high cooling and heating needs and high-temperature differentials. In regions such as the southeastern United States, earth sheltering may need additional care in maintenance and construction due to condensation problems in regard to the high humidity. The ground temperature of the region may be too high to permit earth cooling if temperatures fluctuate only slightly from day to night. Preferably, there should be adequate winter solar radiation and sufficient means for natural ventilation. Wind is a critical aspect to evaluate during site planning, for reasons regarding wind chill and heat loss, as well as ventilation of the shelter. In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing slopes tend to avoid cold winter winds typically blown in from the north. Fully recessed shelters also offer adequate protection against these harsh winds. However, atria within the structure have the ability to cause minor turbulence depending on the size. In the summer, it is helpful to take advantage of the prevailing winds. Because of the limited window arrangement in most earth shelters, and the resistance to air infiltration, the air within a structure can become stagnant if proper ventilation is not provided. By making use of the wind, natural ventilation can occur without the use of fans or other active systems.  Knowing the direction, and intensity, of seasonal winds, is vital in promoting cross ventilation. Vents are commonly placed in the roof of bermed or fully recessed shelters to achieve this effect.

===Vegetation===
The [[plant]] cover of the landscape is another important factor.  Adding plants can be both positive and negative.  Nearby trees may be valuable in wet climates because their roots remove water. However a prospective builder should know what types of trees are in the area and how large and rapidly they tend to grow, due to possible solar-potential compromise with their growth. Vegetation can provide a windbreak for houses exposed to winter winds. The growth of small vegetation, especially those with deep roots, also helps in the prevention of erosion, on the house and in the surrounding site.

===Soil and drainage===
The soil type is one of the essential factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate [[bearing capacity]] and [[drainage]], and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Well, graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] potential. Sand and [[clay]] can be susceptible to [[erosion]]. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against [[capillary action]] responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost-sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.

Water can cause potential damage to earth shelters if it ponds around the shelter. Avoiding sites with a high [[water table]] is crucial. Drainage, both surface, and subsurface must be properly dealt with. Waterproofing applied to the building is essential.

Atrium designs have an increased risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm along the edge of the rooftop is recommended. An interceptor drainage [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]] in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the back of the berm can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel-filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.

Soil stability should also be considered, especially when evaluating a sloping site. These slopes may be inherently stable when left alone, but cutting into them can greatly compromise their structural stability. Retaining walls and backfills may have to be constructed to hold up the slope prior to shelter construction.

==Construction methods==

===Current methods===
In earth-sheltered construction, there is often extensive excavation done on the building site.  An excavation several feet larger than the walls' planned perimeter is made to allow for access to the outside of the wall for waterproofing and insulation.  Once the site is prepared and the utility lines installed, a foundation of reinforced concrete is poured.  The walls are then installed. Usually, they are either poured in place or formed either on or off-site and then moved into place.  Reinforced concrete is the most common choice.  The process is repeated for the roof structure.  If the walls, floor, and roof are all to be poured in place, it is possible to make them with a single pour.  This can reduce the likelihood of there being cracks or leaks at the joints where the concrete has cured at different times.

On the outside of the concrete, a waterproofing system is applied.  The most frequently used waterproofing system includes a layer of liquid asphalt onto which a heavy grade waterproof membrane is affixed, followed by a final liquid water sealant which may be sprayed on.  It is very important to make sure that all of the seams are carefully sealed. It is very difficult to locate and repair leaks in the waterproofing system after the building is completed.

One or more layers of insulation board or foam are added on the outside of the waterproofing.  If the insulation chosen is porous, a top layer of waterproofing is added. After everything is complete, the earth is backfilled into the remaining space at the exterior of the wall and sometimes over the roof to accommodate a green roof.  Any exposed walls and the interior are finished according to the owners' preferences.

===Materials===

====Structural====
Reinforced concrete is the most commonly used structural material in earth shelter construction.  It is strong and readily available.  Untreated wood rots within five years of use in earth shelter construction.  Steel can be used but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal.  Bricks and CMUs (concrete masonry units) are also possible options in earth shelter construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.

Unfortunately, reinforced concrete is not the most environmentally sustainable material.  The concrete industry is working to develop products that are more earth-friendly in response to consumer demands.  Products like [[Grancrete]] and [[Hycrete]] are becoming more readily available.  They claim to be environmentally friendly and either reduce or eliminate the need for additional waterproofing. However, these are new products and have not been extensively used in earth shelter construction yet.

Some unconventional approaches are also proposed.  One such method is a PSP method proposed by Mike Oehler. The PSP method uses wooden posts, plastic sheeting and non-conventional ideas that allow more windows and ventilation.  This design also reduces some runoff problems associated with conventional designs.  The method uses wood posts, a frame that acts like a rib to distribute settling forces, specific construction methods which rely on fewer pieces of heavy equipment, plastic sheeting, and earth floors with plastic and carpeting.

====Waterproofing====
Several layers are used for waterproofing in earth shelter construction.  The first layer is meant to seal any cracks or pores in the structural materials, also working as an adhesive for the waterproof membrane.  The membrane layer is often a thick flexible polyethylene sheeting called [[EPDM rubber|EPDM]].  EPDM is the material usually used in a water garden, pond and swimming pool construction.  This material also prevents roots from burrowing through the waterproofing.  EPDM is very heavy to work with and can be chewed through by some common insects like fire ants. It is also made from petrochemicals, making it less than perfectly environmentally friendly.

There are various cementitious coatings that can be used as waterproofing.  The product is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface.  It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth.  The challenge with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.

Bituthene (registered name) is very similar to the three coat layering process only in one step.  It comes already layered in sheets and has a self-adhesive backing.  The challenge with this is the same as with the manual layering method, in addition, it is sun sensitive and must be covered very soon after application.

Eco-Flex is an environmentally friendly waterproofing membrane that seems to work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering.  It is among a group of liquid paint-on waterproofing products.  The main challenges with these are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.

[[Bentonite]] clay is the alternative that is closest to optimum on the environmental scale.  It is naturally occurring and self-healing.  The drawback to this system is that it is very heavy and difficult for the owner/builder to install and subject to termite damage.

Bi-membranes have been used extensively throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together—typically 2 coats of water-based epoxy as a 'sealer' and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won't 'blow' off the wall in the sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of a high-build flexible water-based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage—this is reinforced with non-woven polypropylene textile in corners and changes in direction.

====Insulation====
Unlike the conventional building, earth shelters require the insulation on the exterior of the building rather than inside the wall.  One reason for this is that it provides protection for the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the earth shelter is able to better retain its desired temperature.  There are two types of insulation used in earth shelter construction.  The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets.  Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient.  The second type of insulation is a spray on foam.  This works very well where the shape of the structure is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to.  Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil to help it resist water penetration.

In some low budget earth shelters, insulation may not be applied to the walls.  These methods rely on the U factor or thermal heat storage capacity of the earth itself below the frost layer.  These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates.  The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the thermal mass of the earth to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical passive solar house.  This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.

==Design for energy conservation==
Earth sheltered homes are often constructed with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of earth shelters allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common plan is to place all the living spaces on the side of the house facing the equator. This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage, and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in hill) side of the shelter.  This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of earth sheltered homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This provides it with a greater ratio of earth cover to an exposed wall than a one-storey shelter would.

With an atrium earth shelter, the living spaces are concentrated around the atrium. The atrium arrangement provides a much less compact plan than that of the one or two story bermed/in hill design; therefore it is commonly less energy efficient, in terms of heating needs. This is one of the reasons why atrium designs are classically applied to warmer climates. However, the atrium does tend to trap air within it which is then heated by the sun and helps reduce heat loss.

==Earth sheltering with solar heating==
Earth sheltering is often combined with solar heating systems. Most commonly, the utilization of passive solar design techniques is used in earth shelters. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south facing structure with the north, east, and west sides covered with earth is the most effective application for [[passive solar]] systems.  A large double glazed window, triple glazed or [[Zomeworks]] [[beadwall]] (vacuum/blower pumps that filled your double pane solar windows with styrofoam balls at night for extra insulation and vacuumed the beads out in the morning, patent now expired.  This changes a window from an R3 thermal resistance to an R16 to R32(depending on the thickness of styrofoam bead wall)), spanning most of the length of the south wall is critical for solar heat gain. It is helpful to accompany the window with insulated drapes to protect against heat loss at night. Also, during the summer months, providing an overhang, or some sort of shading device, is used to block out an excess solar gain. Combining solar heating with earth sheltering is referred to as "[[annualized geo solar]] design", "Passive annual heat storage", or sometimes as an "Umbrella house." (See Nick Pine's posting on Usenet alt.homepower and alt.solar.thermal groups about this type of house.) In the umbrella house, Polystyrene insulation extends around {{convert|23|ft|m}} radius from underground walls. A plastic film covers the insulation (for waterproofing), and soil is a layer on top. The materials slope downward, like an umbrella. It sheds excess water while keeping the soil temperature warm and dry.

[[Passive cooling]] which pulls air with a fan or convection from a nearly constant temperature air into buried [[Earth cooling tubes]] and then into the house living space.  This also provides fresh air to occupants and the air exchange required by [[ASHRAE]].

==Earth shelter construction: history and examples==

===Berming===
[[File:EarthShelterRestAreaOH.JPG|thumb|right|Earth Sheltered rest area along [[Interstate 77 in Ohio]], USA]]

Historically, earth berming was a common building practice that combined heavy timber framing and rough stonework with stacking thick layers of sod or peat against the walls and on the roof.  This served as excellent protection from the elements.  In a relatively short period of time the earth layers grow together leaving the structure with an appearance of a hill with a door.

In these early structures, the heavy timber framing acted as structural support and added comfort and warmth to the interior.  Rough stone was often stacked along the outer walls with a simple lime mortar for structural support and often serves as an exterior facing wall and foundation.  There is a greater use of stone work in earth shelter structures in areas where timber is scarce.  These are the most sustainable of the earth shelters as far as materials go because they are able to decompose and return to earth.  This is why there are few remaining example like Hvalsey Church in Greenland where only the stacked stones remain. One of the oldest examples of berming, dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at [[Skara Brae]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] off northern [[Scotland]].

Today’s bermed earth structures are built quite differently from those of the past.  Common construction employs large amounts of steel reinforced concrete acting as structural support and building shell.  Bulldozers or bobcats are used to pile earth around the building and on the roof instead of stacking earth in place.  One modern example of bermed earth structures is the [[Hockerton Housing Project]], a community of 5 homes in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].

===In-hill===
One historical example of in-hill earth shelters would be [[Mesa Verde]], in the southwest United States.  These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves on the face of the cliffs.  The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure.  Similarly today, in-hill earth shelter construction utilizes the natural formation of a hillside for two to three of the exterior walls and sometimes the roof of a structure.  Alternative builders craft a type of in-hill structure known as an [[Earthship]].  In Earthship construction, [[tire]]s rammed with earth are used as structural materials for three of the walls and generally have a front façade of windows to capture passive solar energy.

A well-known example of an earth-sheltered home is [[Bill Gates' house|the residence of Bill Gates]], who had it built over a period of several years on a heavily wooded site on the shore of [[Lake Washington]], USA. It is an excellent example of the lack of obtrusiveness of this kind of home, since it appears much smaller than it actually is, when seen from the lake.

===Underground===
Though underground construction is relatively uncommon in the US (except for basements where only 1 floor is underground), successful examples can be found in Australia where the ground is so hard that there is little to no need for structural supports and a pick ax and shovel are the tools of the builder/remodeler. See [[Coober Pedy]] and [[Lightning Ridge]]. The [[Forestiere Underground Gardens]] in Fresno, California is a North American example.

In the early 1970s, China undertook the construction of [[Underground City (Beijing)|Dixia Cheng]], a city underneath [[Beijing]].  It was primarily a complex of bomb shelters that could house 40% of the population at that time.  It was a response to the fear of Soviet attack.  Parts of it are now used in more commercial ventures.

The '''Floral Genome Project''' is a collaborative research cooperation primarily between [[Penn State University]], [[University of Florida]], and [[Cornell University]]. The initial funding came from a grant of $7.4 million from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The Floral Genome Project was initiated to bridge the genomic gap between the most broadly studied plant model systems. According to the [http://www.floralgenome.org/ website], the following are the aims of the project:

The '''Friedrich Ebert Foundation''' (''[[German language|German]]: '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung'''; Abbreviation: '''FES''''') is a German political [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] associated with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), yet independent of it. Established in 1925 as the political legacy of [[Friedrich Ebert]], Germany's first democratically elected President, it is the largest and oldest of the German party-associated foundations. It is headquartered in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], and has offices and projects in over 100 countries. It is Germany's oldest organisation to promote democracy, political education, and promote students of outstanding intellectual abilities and personality.
==History==
The FES was named for [[Friedrich Ebert]] (1871–1925), the Social Democratic [[President of Germany]], 1919-1925. In his [[Will (law)|will]], he specified that the proceeds from donations at his funeral should be used to create a foundation.  The SPD chairman at the time, [[Konrad Ludwig]], was given the responsibility of building this foundation, which he did a few days after Ebert's death in 1925.
The main concern of the foundation was to work against discrimination of workers in the area of education:
"The Friedrich Ebert Foundation pursues the goal of giving young, empowered [[proletarians]] government aid to fund an education at state-accredited institutions.  As a basic principle, only those people who have a recommendation from the party organisation will receive funding." (SPD Yearbook 1926)
By the end of 1931, 295 students had been funded with over 52,000 [[Deutsche Mark|marks]].  Unfortunately, at this point the funding of the foundation fell through, as a result of the [[Great Depression]].
The FES was a section of the Social Democratic Education and Culture Organisation, and was banned along with the party itself in 1933 by the [[Nazi]]s.
In 1946, the FES was reinstituted at the founding assembly of the Socialist German Student Federation. In 1954, the FES was restructured into a charitable organisation "for the advancement of democratic education". This established the FES as an independent, self-contained institute.
In addition to education programmes, the FES has also worked in the area of [[development aid]] since the 1960s.  In this effort, it has supported democracy and freedom movements, for instance in the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and played an important role in overcoming dictatorial regimes in [[Greece]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]].  Thus it was not a coincidence that the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party of Portugal]] was formed in an FES school in the German town of [[Bad Münstereifel]].

==Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation==
The '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation''' ('''FES''') is one of eleven organizations for the promotion of young talents (Begabtenförderwerke) in Germany. Only 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the eleven organizations (i.e. FES, [[Studienstiftung]], [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stipendiumplus.de/&lt;/ref&gt; It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, letters of recommendation, letters of motivation, political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours.  In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women.  Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications.  The FES kept its own conference center on the Venusberg in [[Bonn]] for these activities until its closure in 2009.  Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Stresemann Institute in Bonn.  This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation.  The FES maintains a website ([http://www.fes-stip.de] www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.

Students are assigned advisors who work with them for the length of their grants, and also belong to a student organisation.

==Further activities==
[[File:Bonn FES.jpg|thumb|250px|Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Bonn]]
Today, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's main goals are to promote political and societal education of people from all walks of life in the spirit of democracy and pluralism, to enable young people the opportunity to study and do research through grants, and to work toward international understanding and cooperation.

The foundation employs several hundred employees in their offices in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], as well as in 14 regional offices and an academy within Germany and in over 100 foreign agencies.  It is financed mainly through grants from the federal budget and the budgets of the various [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]].

Since 1971, foreign students have also had the opportunity to receive grants through solidarity funds.  Preference for these grants goes to people who are persecuted on political, racial or religious grounds.  Funding for this program comes exclusively from donations from current and former grantees.  The program have helped over 1,000 students.  Currently there are 31 students who are in the solidarity programme. Two grantees from this programme are chosen every year at the conference in Bonn to work on the steering committee of the fund.

The historical research center of the foundation also contains the Archive of Social Democracy and its libraries in Bonn and at the [[Karl Marx House]] in [[Trier]].  This is one of the largest collections of documents on [[social history]] and the history of the [[Labour movement|workers movement]].

Since 1982, the foundation has awarded a prize of 10,000 euro called "The Political Book" to promote noteworthy political books. The prize serves to remind people of the [[Nazi book burnings]] of May 10, 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26807">The cells that give rise to the [[gametes]] are often set aside during [[Cleavage (embryo)|embryonic cleavage]]. During development, these cells will differentiate into [[primordial germ cells]], migrate to the location of the gonad, and form the [[Germline|germ line]] of the animal.

==Creation of germ plasm and primordial germ cells==
Cleavage in most animals segregates cells containing [[germ plasm]] from other cells. The germ plasm effectively turns off gene expression to render the genome of the cell inert. Cells expressing germ plasm become [[primordial germ cells]] (PGCs) which will then give rise to the [[gametes]]. The germ line development in mammals, on the other hand, occurs by induction and not by an endogenous germ plasm.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Germ plasm in fruit fly===
Germ plasm has been studied in detail in Drosophila. The posterior pole of the embryo contains necessary materials for the fertility of the fly. This cytoplasm, pole plasm, contains specialized materials called polar granules and the [[pole cell]]s are the precursors to primordial germ cells.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Pole plasm is organized by and contains the proteins and mRNA of the posterior group genes (such as [[oskar]], [[nanos gene]], Tudor, vasa, and Valois). These genes play a role in germ line development to localize nanos mRNA to the posterior and localize germ cell determinants. Drosophila progeny with mutations in these genes fail to produce pole cells and are thus sterile, giving these mutations the name 'grandchildless'. The genes [[Oskar]], nanos and germ cell-less (gcl) have important roles. Oskar is sufficient to recruit the other genes to form functional germ plasm. Nanos is required to prevent mitosis and somatic differentiation and for the pole cells to migrate to function as PGCs (see next section). Gcl is necessary (but not sufficient) for pole cell formation. In addition to these genes, Pgc polar granule component blocks phosphorylation and consequently activation of RNA polymerase II and shuts down transcription.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Germ plasm in amphibians===
Similar germ plasm has been identified in Amphibians in the polar cytoplasm at the vegetal pole. This cytoplasm moves to the bottom of the blastocoel and eventually ends up as its own subset of endodermal cells. These cells eventually become PGCs. The presence of homologs of nanos and vasa also implicate this germ plasm as germ-determining.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Migration of primordial germ cells==

===Fruit flies===
The first phase of migration in Drosophila occurs when the pole cells move passively and infold into the midgut invagination. Active migration occurs through repellents and attractants. The expression of wunen in the endoderm repels the PGCs out. The expression of columbus and hedgehog attracts the PGCs to the mesodermal precursors of the gonad. Nanos is required during migration. Regardless of PGC injection site, PGCs are able to correctly migrate to their target sites.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Zebrafish===
In zebrafish, the PGCs express two CXCR4 transmembrane receptor proteins. The signaling system involving this protein and its ligand, Sdf1, is necessary and sufficient to direct PGC migration in fish.

===Frogs===
In frogs, the PGCs migrate along the mesentery to the gonadal mesoderm facilitated by orientated extracellular matrix with fibronectin. There is also evidence for the CXCR4/Sdf1 system in frogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Birds===
In birds, the PGCs arise from the epiblast and migrate to anteriorly of the primitive streak to the germinal ridge. From there, they use blood vessels to find their way to the gonad. It is possible that the CXCR4/Sdf1 system is used.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Differentiation of primordial germ cells==
Prior to their occupation of the genital ridge, there is no known difference between XX and XY PGCs.&lt;ref name=pmid20027186/&gt; However, once migration is complete, male and female PGCs begin to differentiate differently.

===Early male differentiation===

Male PGCs become known as [[gonocytes]] once they cease migration and undergo mitosis.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237&gt;{{cite journal |author=Culty M |title=Gonocytes, from the fifties to the present: is there a reason to change the name? |journal=Biology of Reproduction |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=46 |date=August 2013  |pmid=23843237 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.113.110544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gonocyte is generally used to describe all stages post PGC until the gonocytes differentiate into spermatogonia.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; Anatomically, gonocytes can be identified as large, euchromatic cells that often have two nucleoli in the nucleus.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt;

In the male genital ridge, transient [[Testis determining factor|Sry]] expression causes supporting cells to differentiate into [[Sertoli cells]] which then act as the organizing center for testis differentiation.

Retinoic acid acts as a signal to the gonocytes to enter [[meiosis]].&lt;ref name=pmid24324457/&gt; The gonocyte and Sertoli cells have been shown to form [[Gap junctions|gap and desmosomelike junctions]] as well as adherins junctions composed of [[cadherin]]s and [[connexin]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; To differentiate into spermatogonia, the gonocytes must lose their junctions to Sertoli cells and become migratory once again.&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; They migrate to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cord&lt;ref name=pmid23843237/&gt; and differentiate.

===Late differentiation===

In the gonads, the germ cells undergo either spermatogenesis or oogenesis depending on whether the sex is male or female respectively.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Spermatogenesis===
{{Main|Spermatogenesis}}
Mitotic germ stem cells, [[spermatogonia]], divide by mitosis to produce [[spermatocytes]] committed to meiosis. The spermatocytes divide by meiosis to form [[spermatids]]. The post-meiotic spermatids differentiate through [[spermiogenesis]] to become mature and functional [[spermatozoa]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} [[Spermatogenesis|Spermatogenic cells]] at different stages of development in the mouse have a frequency of [[mutation]] that is 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequency in [[somatic cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

===Oogenesis===
{{Main|Oogenesis}}
Mitotic germ stem cells, [[oogonia]], divide by mitosis to produce primary [[oocytes]] committed to meiosis. Unlike sperm production, oocyte production is not continuous. These primary oocytes begin meiosis but pause in [[diplotene]] of [[meiosis I]] while in the embryo. All of the oogonia and many primary oocytes die before birth. After puberty in primates, small groups of oocytes and follicles prepare for ovulation by advancing to metaphase II. Only after fertilization is meiosis completed. Meiosis is asymmetric producing polar bodies and oocytes with large amounts of material for embryonic development.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The mutation frequency of female mouse germ line cells, like male germ line cells, is also lower than that of somatic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

'''Global Money Week (GMW)''' is a global money awareness celebration that takes place in March every year.&lt;ref name="newsandevents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=Global Money Week|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is coordinated by the [[Child and Youth Finance International]] (CYFI) Secretariat to raise awareness on [[Economic Citizenship]] and directly engage children and youth worldwide on the issue. The celebration of Global Money Week consists of a series of activities held at the regional, national and local level by the partners and stakeholders of the Child and Youth Finance Movement, and are geared toward engaging children, youth and their communities in learning about financial education and financial inclusion.&lt;ref name="newsandevents" /&gt;

According to the Global Money Week website, “GMW is an annual global celebration, initiated by Child &amp; Youth Finance International (CYFI), with local and regional events and activities aimed at inspiring children and youth to learn about money, saving, creating livelihoods, gaining employment and becoming an entrepreneur.” &lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GMW in previous years==
In 2013, GMW involved approximately 1 million children in 80 countries ranging across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Over 1000 activities were organized by 403 organizations, such as NGOs, central banks, Ministries of Finance, corporations and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/global_money_week_report_2013/1?e=7128000/2518812|title=Global Money Week Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMW 2014 saw the participation of 3 million children, 118 countries, over 2000 activities and 490 organizations involved in the theme of enterprise: among those, central banks, governmental bodies, educational institutions.&lt;ref name="globalmoneyweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalmoneyweek.org/civil-society |title=Civil Society |publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 event saw a number of multi-sectoral organizations working together for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/2014_gmw_report_2014_8589ec3f401824|title=Global Money Week Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During GMW 2015 the theme was, “Save Today, Safe Tomorrow.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2015/1?e=7128000/14165258|title=Global Money Week Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|format=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5.6 million children &amp; youth took part in the celebrations in 124 countries.

In 2016, GMW expanded even further, reaching over 7 million children and young people across 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2016/1?e=7128000/38177764|title=Global Money Week Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ever increasing number of countries and organizations were involved in supporting the millions of young people taking part in money awareness, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship activities during the 2016 Global Money Week celebrations, which focused on the theme 'Take Part, Save Smart'.

The 2017 edition of GMW will take place from 27 March - 2 April, with the theme 'Learn Save Earn':
* Learn: Educating children and young people about their social and economic rights and responsibilities is key to creating a generation of capable adults who can make wise decisions for their future
* Save: It is important for children and youth to build clever savings habits from an early age in order to cultivate key money-managing skills for later in life
* Earn: Developing livelihoods skills or receiving entrepreneurial training supports children and young people with getting a job or building their own business and developing their careers.

==Types of activities==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14966">'''Hydrothermal liquefaction''' (HTL) is a [[thermal depolymerization]] process used to convert wet [[biomass]] into crude-like oil -sometimes referred to as [[Biofuel|bio-oil]] or biocrude- under moderate temperature and high pressure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A review on process conditions for optimum bio-oil yield in hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032110004235|journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date = 2011-04-01|pages = 1615–1624|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2010.11.054|first = Javaid|last = Akhtar|first2 = Nor Aishah Saidina|last2 = Amin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crude-like oil (or bio-oil) has high [[energy density]] with a [[Heat of combustion|lower heating value]] of 33.8-36.9 MJ/kg and 5-20 wt% oxygen and renewable chemicals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Historical Developments in Hydroprocessing Bio-oils|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ef070044u|journal = Energy &amp; Fuels|date = 2007-05-01|issn = 0887-0624|pages = 1792–1815|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.1021/ef070044u|first = Douglas C.|last = Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Liquid fuels from biomass via a hydrothermal process|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/000925099080164A|journal = Chemical Engineering Science|date = 1990-01-01|volume = 45|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/0009-2509(90)80164-a|first = F.|last = Goudriaan|first2 = D.G.R.|last2 = Peferoen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction usually involves homogeneous and/or heterogeneous [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to improve the quality of products and yields.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Carbon and hydrogen of an organic material, such as biomass, peat or low-ranked coals (lignite) are thermo-chemically converted into hydrophobic compounds with low viscosity and high solubility. Depending on the processing conditions, the fuel can be used as produced for heavy engines, including marine and rail or upgraded to transportation fuels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|issue=7|page=6765|doi=10.3390/en8076765|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/7/6765}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as diesel, gasoline or jet-fuels.

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the
Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Other organizations that have previously demonstrated HTL of biomass include Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg, Germany, SCF Technologies in Copenhagen, Denmark, EPA’s Water Engineering Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and Changing World Technology Inc. (CWT), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Today, technology companies such as [http://www.licella.com.au Licella/Ignite Energy Resources] (Australia), [http://www.altacaenerji.com/en/ Altaca Energy] (Turkey), [http://steeperenergy.com/ Steeper Energy] (Denmark, Canada), and [http://nabrosenergy.in/ Nabros Energy] (India) continue to explore the commercialization of HTL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://task39.org/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf|title = The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels|date = July 2014|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = A report by IEA Bioenergy Task 39|author1=Sergios Karatzos |author2=James D. McMillan |author3=Jack N. Saddler }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

===Feedstock===

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ISRO Satellite Centre''' (ISAC) ({{lang-hi|इसरो उपग्रह केंद्र}} {{lang-kn|ಇಸ್ರೋ ಉಪಗ್ರಹ ಕೇಂದ್ರ}}) is the leading centre of [[ISRO]] for design, development, fabrication and testing of all Indian made satellites. It was established in the year of 1972 as Indian Scientific Satellite Project (ISSP) in Peenya Industrial Estates of Bengaluru.&lt;ref name="age40"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/bangalore-news/bangalores-isro-satellite-centre-turns-forty-481967 | title=Bangalore's ISRO Satellite Centre turns forty}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAC has been renamed as '''U. R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC)''' after the former [[ISRO]] Chairman and ISAC founding Director Dr. [[Udupi Ramachandra Rao]] with effect from 2nd April 2018.

Situated in Vimanapura Post of [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]], the centre has recently produced and launched its 100th satellite &lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-launch-100th-satellite-today-a-look-at-space-agency-s-ten-achievements/story-WSNCAVHswR8XUsho2ie8vL_amp.html | title=ISAC's maiden century}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[INSAT]] series, the [[Indian Remote Sensing satellite|IRS]] series, as well as the [[GSAT]] communication satellites.

Organisations under the umbrella of ISAC include the [[Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems]] (LEOS) and the [[ISRO Satellite Integration and Testing Establishment (ISITE)]].
 
Dr. [[P. Kunhikrishnan]] is the current director of [[ISRO]] Satellite Centre ('''ISAC''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/sdsc-shar-chief-kunhikrishnan-appointed-u-r-rao-satellite-centre-s-director-118073101394_1.html|title=SDSC-SHAR chief Kunhikrishnan appointed U R Rao Satellite Centre's director|last=|first=|date=31 July 2018|work=Business Standard|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
Like other ISRO centres, ISAC is organised under Matrix Management Structure. The centre is divided into many Functional Areas like Control and Mission Area, Electronic Systems Area, Mechanical Systems Area, Reliability and Components Area etc. Each Area is further divided into groups. For instance, Control and Mission area has many groups like Control Systems Group, Flight Dynamics Group etc. Again Groups are divided into Divisions. For example, Control Systems Group has many divisions like Control Electronics Division, Control Dynamics and Analysis Division etc. Apart from this, Project Planning and Evaluation Group, Computer and Information Group, Space Astronomy and Instrumentation Division are independent, also facilities (like Thermovac facility etc.) and Projects (like IRS, INSAT,SATNAV, etc.) also exists.

'''Industrial heritage''' refers to the physical remains of the [[history of technology]] and [[History of industry|industry]], such as manufacturing and mining sites, as well as power and transportation infrastructure. The term is often also used in connection with museums or historic places related to industry, including worker housing and warehouses. The scientific study of such remains is called [[industrial archaeology]]. The industrial heritage of a region is an aspect of its [[cultural heritage]]. The international organization dedicated to the study and preservation of such is [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]], known as TICCIH.

'''The Institute for Fiscal Studies''' is an [[economics|economic]] [[research institute]] based in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], which specialises in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom|UK taxation]] and [[public policy]].&lt;ref name=aboutifs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/aboutIFS|title=About IFS|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is politically independent and produces both academic and policy-related findings.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Akam |first= Simon | authorlink= |title= The British umpire: how the IFS became the most influential voice in the economic debate |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/british-umpire-how-institute-fiscal-studies-became-most-influential-voice-in-uk-economic-debate| date= 15 March 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 18 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's aim is to "advance education for the benefit of the public by promoting on a non-political basis the study and discussion of and the exchange and dissemination of information and knowledge concerning national economic and social effects and influences of existing taxes and proposed changes in fiscal systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Charity Commission Central Register: ''Institute for Fiscal Studies'' |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=258815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of [[Central London]], adjacent to the [[University of Law]] and close to the [[British Museum]] and [[University College London]] (UCL).

== History ==

The Institute was founded in response to the passing of the [[Finance Act 1965]] by four financial professionals: a banker and later Conservative Party politician ([[William Hopper (politician)|Will Hopper]]), an investment trust manager (Bob Buist), a stockbroker ([[Nils Taube]]), and a tax consultant (John Chown).&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; In 1964, the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[James Callaghan]] had made a speech announcing his intentions to make changes to the tax system, including the introduction of a [[capital gains tax]] and a [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]]. The group felt that the proposals were "half-baked".&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Bill|date=August 1990|title=The Early Days of IFS|journal=Fiscal Studies|volume=11|issue=3|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Taube had commissioned John Chown to prepare a professional analysis of the speech and its effect on share prices. Chown described what he thought the impact of the proposals would be if implemented but also treated the exercise as a ''"[[reductio ad absurdum]]"'' and suggested that "the government and its advisors had three or four months for second thoughts and, recognising some of the dire consequences, would modify their original proposals."&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"/&gt; The Chancellor did not change his mind. This led to further discussion among the group about their views on tax reform and the Budget process. In Chown's words, the group wanted to ensure that "never again should a government, regardless of its political colour and intentions, introduce far-reaching tax legislation without the benefit of deep and thorough analysis of second- and third-order effects."&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"/&gt;

In 1967 a brainstorming weekend took place at The Bell, [[Aston Clinton]]. In the same year, the group published ''A Charter for the Taxpayer'' with proposals for tax changes in ''[[The Times]]'', and Jeremy Skinner and Halmer Hudson joined the group. Will Hopper has recalled that the idea of a research institute did not take shape until some time later at a dinner which was attended by Bob Buist, John Chown, Nils Taube and himself on 30 July 1968 at the Stella Alpina restaurant, 32 North Audley Street, London, at which a decision was made to found the Institute. Will Hopper proposed the name 'Institute for Fiscal Studies'. 'Fiscal' was selected rather than just 'tax' "because we wished to include the other side of fisc. You cannot discuss the economic impact of taxation without looking at expenditure and the balance between the two."&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"/&gt; The Institute was formally incorporated on 21 May 1969.

As well as research, the Institute had wider, unspoken objectives. The founders did not just want to start an Institute; they wanted to change British [[Fiscal policy|fiscal strategy]]. In particular, the group's declared aims were "to alter the climate of opinion within which changes to the British tax system were considered; to alter the procedures by which changes in the tax system were effected; and to help create a more rational tax system".&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"/&gt;

In 1970, [[Dick Taverne]], then a Labour MP and a former [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] in the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] government, was approached to be the Institute's first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taverne|first=Dick|date=March 2014|title=Against the Tide: politics and beyond|page=206|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/bundles/ifsabout/files/dicktaverne_ch8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 a Council of the Institute was formed, with President Sir Richard Powell (civil servant) and Vice-Presidents [[Roy Jenkins]] (Labour Party) and [[Selwyn Lloyd]] (Conservative Party).&lt;ref name="fiscstudies"/&gt; In the same year an Executive Committee was formed, with Will Hopper as Chairman, Halmer Hudson as Secretary and Buist, Chown, Skinner and Taube as Members. In 1972, the first full-time staff of the Institute were appointed. In 1974, the Institute moved from Bell Yard to Chandos Place. In 1975, the Meade Committee began its enquiries under the leadership of the later Nobel laureate [[James Meade]]. Simon Akam wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2016: "Meade was assisted by two young economists: [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]], who would go on to become director of the IFS, and [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury| Mervyn King]], who would later become governor of the Bank of England."&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; In 1978, the Meade Report was published and the Institute moved to Castle Lane. In 1979, the ''[[Fiscal Studies]]'' publication was launched and the ''Working Paper'' series began. In 1980, the Armstrong Report was published. In 1982, the Report series was launched and the first ''Green Budget'' was issued. In 1984, ''The Reform of Social Security'' document was published by the Institute. In 1985, the Institute moved to [[Tottenham Court Road]]. In 1987, the Capital Taxes Group was established. In 1990, the Institute moved to Ridgmount Street. In 1991, the ESRC Centre was inaugurated.&lt;ref name=CPP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/centres/esrcIndex|title=ESRC Centre homepage|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824082817/http://www.ifs.org.uk/centres/esrcIndex|archivedate=24 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Tax Law Review Committee was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/centres/TLRC/|title=Tax Law Review Committee|accessdate=22 September 2014|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Areas of research covered by the Institute include [[public finance]] and spending, [[pensions]] and saving, [[company taxation]], consumer behaviour and [[poverty]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name=whatwedo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/aboutIFS/what|title=What we do|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the Institute's research is UK-focused, recent work has also looked at international development policies, for instance at education and nutrition programmes in [[Colombia]]. In October 2016, Professor [[Orazio Attanasio]], the IFS' Research Director and Head of UCL Economics, won the Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize for his work in the latter field.&lt;ref name="Science Business press release 13 October 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sciencebusiness.net/news/79956/UCL-economist-receives-Klaus-J.-Jacobs-Research-Prize|title= UCL economist receives Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize: Press release |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 13 October 2016 |website= sciencebusiness.net |publisher= Science Business Publishing Ltd. | accessdate= 13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is home to – or a partner in – the following research centres (some of which are described further, in following sections):

*Centre for the [[Microeconomics|Microeconomic]] Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)
*Centre for the Evaluation of Development Policies (EDePo)
*Tax Law Review Committee (TLRC)
*[[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA)
*Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (cemmap)

===Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy===
Since 1991 the Institute has hosted an [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) research centre, the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP).&lt;ref name="CPP"/&gt; The CPP is directed by Professor [[Richard Blundell]] and co-directors, Professor [[Orazio Attanasio]], Professor James Banks, Professor [[Rachel Griffith]], Professor [[Costas Meghir]].&lt;ref name=CPP/&gt; The CPP carries out microeconomic analysis of major public policy issues, including productivity growth, poverty reduction, promoting employment and ensuring sound public finances.&lt;ref name=CPP/&gt; Its focus is on the modelling of individual, household and firm behaviour.

===Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice===
The Institute hosts the Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (Cemmap), a joint venture between the Institute and the [[UCL Faculty of Social and Historical Sciences#Departments|UCL Department of Economics]].&lt;ref name=cemmap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cemmap.ac.uk/about.php|title=About|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527004733/http://www.cemmap.ac.uk/about.php|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cemmap's activities include:

*conducting research and organising conferences, symposia, workshops and training courses;
*developing and applying methods for modelling individual behaviour, the influences on it and the impact of policy interventions; and
*maintaining an extensive network of fellows in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref name=cemmap/&gt;

Cemmap organises regular training courses and masterclasses and is home to one of the world's leading working papers series in the field of microeconometrics with over 100 titles, many of which are published in leading journals.&lt;ref name=cemmap/&gt;

Cemmap was founded in 2000 with a grant from the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and since 2007 has been an ESRC research centre.&lt;ref name=cemmap/&gt;

==Publications==
The Institute regularly publishes policy-reports and academic articles. It also produces a [[peer-review]]ed quarterly journal, ''[[Fiscal Studies]]'', which publishes articles submitted by a range of academics and practitioners in the field.&lt;ref name=publications&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications|title=Publications &amp; Research|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IFS ''Green Budget'', which discusses policy issues which are likely to be relevant for the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]'s annual budget statement, is published early each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/tools_and_resources/green_budget|accessdate=22 September 2014|title=IFS Green Budgets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy publication is the Mirrlees Review, which was published in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/mirrleesreview/|title=Mirrlees Review|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review consists of two volumes. The first of these is a series of chapters covering different aspects of the UK tax system, accompanied by commentaries voicing different opinions. The second sets out the conclusions of the review. The review was chaired by Nobel Laureate [[James Mirrlees]] and included contributions from IFS staff alongside prominent economists from various universities around the world.

==Criticism==
The Institute frequently speaks out on politically important issues and has at different times been criticised from both sides of the political spectrum. In October 2010, [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] accused the IFS of using methods that were "distorted and a complete nonsense"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/21/nick-clegg-attacks-ifs|title=Nick Clegg accuses IFS of 'distorted nonsense'|date=21 October 2010|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it challenged government claims that tax and benefit reforms in the June 2010 Budget were "[[Progressive tax|progressive]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/pr/progressive_budget.pdf|title=New IFS research challenges Chancellor's 'progressive Budget' claim|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated: "Some left-leaning economists look with particular scepticism on the claim that the IFS has no ideology, arguing that the institute holds an excessive faith in the power of market forces. The tax campaigner [[Richard Murphy (tax campaigner)|Richard Murphy]], a professor of political economy at City University who advised in Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for the Labour leadership, said the IFS was 'embedded in all the normal, standard pro-market assumptions that dominate conventional economic thinking in the UK and elsewhere'."&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; Richard Murphy also stated in a report that the "Institute for Fiscal Studies is a body that persistently recommends tax increases that benefit the wealthiest in society at cost to those who make their living from work and the poorest in society".&lt;ref name="taxres"&gt;http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/VATRegressive.pdf pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion, the right-leaning magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' published a leader stating that {{"'}}institutes' funded by research grants (which means, usually, tax money) will always argue for more expensive meddling by the state" and that the Institute for Fiscal Studies was "the most striking example" of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/7112823/leading-article-the-power-of-ideas/|title=Leading article: The power of ideas|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">An '''instruction window''' in [[computer architecture]] refers to the set of [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s which can [[out-of-order execution|execute out-of-order]] in a [[speculative execution|speculative]] [[processor (computing)|processor]].

In particular, in a conventional design, the instruction window consists of all instructions which are in the [[re-order buffer]] (ROB).&lt;ref&gt;Shen and Lipasti. ''Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors.'' McGraw-Hill, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a processor, any instruction within the instruction window can be executed when its operands are ready. Out-of-order processors derive their name because this may occur out-of-order (if operands to a younger instruction are ready before those of an older instruction).

The instruction window has a finite size, and new instructions can enter the window (usually called ''dispatch'' or ''allocate'') only when other instructions leave the window (usually called ''retire'' or ''commit''). Instructions enter and leave the instruction window in program order, and an instruction can only leave the window when it is the oldest instruction in the window and it has been completed. Hence, the instruction window can be seen as a sliding window in which the instructions can become out-of-order. All execution within the window is speculative (i.e., side-effects are not applied outside the CPU) until it is committed in order to support asynchronous [[exception handling]] like [[interrupt]]s.

This paradigm is also known as '''restricted dataflow'''&lt;ref&gt;Patt et al., ''HPS, A New Microarchitecture: Rationale and Introduction.'' In IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; because instructions within the window execute in dataflow order (not necessarily in program order) but the window in which this occurs is restricted (of finite size).

The instruction window is distinct from [[Instruction pipeline|pipelining]]: instructions in an in-order pipeline are not in an instruction window in the conventionally understood sense, because they cannot execute out of order with respect to one another. Out-of-order processors are usually built around pipelines, but many of the pipeline stages (e.g., front-end instruction fetch and decode stages) are not considered to be part of the instruction window.

'''Interception&lt;ref&gt;Gerrits, A.M.J. and Savenije, H.H.G. (2011), Interception. In: Peter Wilderer (ed.) [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/724305/description#description Treatise on Water Science], vol. 2, pp. 89–101 Oxford: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;''' refers to [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that does not reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves, branches of plants and the forest floor. It occurs in the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] (i.e. [[canopy interception]]), and in the [[forest floor]] or litter layer (i.e. forest floor interception &lt;ref&gt;Gerrits, A.M.J. and Savenije, H.H.G. (2011) (invited), [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p78t002p857nx576/fulltext.pdf Forest floor interception]. In Levia, D.F., Carlyle-Moses, D.E. and Tanaka, T. (Eds.), Forest Hydrology and Biogeochemistry: Synthesis of Past Research and Future Directions. Ecological Studies Series, No. 216, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of [[evaporation]], interception of liquid water generally leads to loss of that precipitation for the [[drainage basin]], except for cases such as fog interception, but increase flood protection dramatically, Alila et al., (2009). 
[[File:Interception types text small.jpg|thumb|Definition of canopy and forest floor interception]]
Intercepted [[snow]]fall does not result in any notable amount of evaporation, and most of the snow falls off the tree by wind or melts. However, intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind, out of the watershed. [[Pinophyta|Conifer]]s have a greater interception capacity than [[Flowering plant|hardwood]]s. Their needles gives them more [[Area|surface area]] for [[Drop (liquid)|droplet]]s to adhere to, and they have [[Leaf|foliage]] in [[Spring (season)|spring]] and [[Autumn|fall]], therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area.

Mitscherlich in 1971 calculated the water storage potential as interception values for different species and stand densities. A storm event might produce 50 - 100 mm of rainfall and 4 mm might be the maximum intercepted in this way. Grah and Wilson in 1944 did sprinkling experiments where they watered plants to see how much of the intercepted is kept after watering stops.

The interception depends on the leaf area index and what kind of leaves they are.

Interception may increase erosion or reduce it depending on the [[throughfall]] effects.

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London, Jews have been conspicuous for their socialist and communist affiliations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''liana''' is any of various long-[[Plant stem|stemmed]], [[Woody plant|woody]] [[vine]]s that are [[root]]ed in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] to get access to well-lit areas of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338786/liana |title=liana|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas are characteristic of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist deciduous forests]] (especially [[Tropical seasonal forest|seasonal forests]]), but may be found in [[temperate rainforests]]. There are also [[temperate]] lianas, for example the members of the ''[[Clematis]]'' or ''[[Vitis]]'' (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref name="SCHNITZER-BONGERS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnitzer |first1=S.

The term "liana" is not a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] grouping, but rather a description of the way the plant grows – much like "[[tree]]" or "[[shrub]]". Lianas may be found in many different plant [[family (biology)|families]]. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the [[stiffness]], specifically, the [[Young's modulus]] of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.92.8.1381 | title = Evolution of shrub-like growth forms in the lianoid subfamily Secamonoideae (Apocynaceae s.l.) of Madagascar: phylogeny, biomechanics, and development | year = 2005 | author = Lahaye, R. | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 92 | pages = 1381–96 | last2 = Civeyrel | first2 = L. | last3 = Speck | first3 = T. | last4 = Rowe | first4 = N.

As noted by [[Charles Darwin]], because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2387889| jstor = 2387889| pages = 19–23| title = How trees avoid and shed lianas| journal = Biotropica| volume = 16| issue = 1| year = 1984| author1 = Putz | first1 = F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6982">In [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the '''Lyman-alpha forest''' is a series of  [[Spectral line|absorption line]]s in the spectra of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s arising from the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] of the neutral [[hydrogen]] atom.  As the light travels through multiple gas clouds with different redshifts, multiple absorption lines are formed.

==History==
The Lyman-alpha forest was first discovered in 1970 by astronomer Roger Lynds in an observation of the [[quasar]] [[List of quasars#Most distant quasars|4C 05.34]].&lt;ref name="mcdonald2004"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Lyman-α Forest Power Spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey | author1=Patrick McDonald | author2=Uros Seljak | author3=Scott Burles | author4=Schlegel | author5=Weinberg | author6=David Shih | author7=Joop Schaye | author8=Schneider | author9=Brinkmann | doi=10.1086/444361 | journal=Astrophys.

Follow-up observations by [[John N. Bahcall|John Bahcall]] and Samuel Goldsmith confirmed the presence of the unusual absorption lines, though they were less conclusive about the origin of the lines.&lt;ref name='bahcall_1971'&gt;{{cite journal | title = On the Absorption-Line Spectrum of 4c 05.34 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | date = 1971-11-15 | first = John | last = Bahcall |author2=Samuel Goldsmith  | volume = 170 | pages = 17–24| id = | doi=10.1086/151185 | bibcode = 1971ApJ...170...17B | bibcode-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the spectra of many other high-redshift quasars were observed to have the same system of narrow absorption lines. Lynds was the first to describe them as the "Lyman-alpha forest".&lt;ref name='burbidge_skytel_quasars'&gt;{{cite journal | title = A catalog of quasars near and far | journal = Sky &amp; Telescope | date = December 1994 | first = Geoffrey R. | last = Burbidge |author2=Adelaide Hewitt  | volume = 88 | issue = 6 | pages = 32| id = |bibcode = 1994S&amp;T....88...32B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Oort]] argued that the absorption features are due not to any physical interactions within the quasars themselves, but to absorption inside clouds of [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic gas]] in superclusters.&lt;ref name='oort_obit'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Jan Hendrik Oort (1900–1992) | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date = July 1993 | first = Adriaan | last = Blaauw |author2=Martin Schmidt  | volume = 105 | issue = 689 | pages = 681–685 | doi=10.1086/133220 | bibcode=1993PASP..105..681B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical background==
For a neutral [[hydrogen]] atom, spectral lines are formed when an electron transitions between energy levels. The Lyman series of spectral lines are produced by electrons transitioning between the ground state and higher energy levels (excited states). The Lyman-alpha transition corresponds to an electron transitioning between the ground state (n=1) and the first excited state (n=2). The Lyman-alpha spectral line has a laboratory, or rest, wavelength of 1216 Å, which is in the [[ultraviolet]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name='modern_astrophysics'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Bradley W. | last2 = Ostlie | first2 = Dale A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics | chapter = The Interaction of Light and Matter | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. | date = 1996 | location = New York, New York | pages = 134–142 | isbn = 0-201-54730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar spectra result from intergalactic gas through which the [[galaxy]] or quasar's light has traveled. Since [[H I region|neutral hydrogen clouds]] in the intergalactic medium are at different degrees of [[redshift]] (due to their varying distance from Earth), their absorption lines are observed at a range of [[wavelength]]s. Each individual cloud leaves its [[fingerprint]] as an [[absorption line]] at a different position in the observed [[absorption spectrum|spectrum]].

==Use as a tool in astrophysics==

The Lyman-alpha forest is an important probe of the [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic medium]] and can be used to determine the frequency and density of clouds containing neutral [[hydrogen]], as well as their temperature. Searching for lines from other elements like [[helium]], [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] (matching in [[redshift]]), the abundance of heavier elements in the clouds can also be studied. A cloud with a high column density of neutral hydrogen will show typical [[damping wings]] around the line and is referred to as a [[damped Lyman-alpha system]].

For quasars at higher redshift the number of lines in the forest is higher, until at a redshift of about 6, where there is so much neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium that the forest turns into a [[Gunn-Peterson trough]]. This shows the end of the [[reionization]] of the universe.

The Lyman-alpha forest observations can be used to constrain cosmological models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of '''materials science''', also commonly termed '''materials science and engineering''' is the design and discovery of new materials, particularly [[solid]]s. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when researchers began to use analytical thinking from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]] to understand ancient, [[Empirical relationship|phenomenological]] observations in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Eddy|first1= Matthew Daniel|title= The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date= 2008|publisher= Ashgate|url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903230852/http://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_|archivedate= 2015-09-03|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Cyril Stanley |authorlink= Cyril Stanley Smith |title= A Search for Structure |date= 1981 |publisher= MIT Press |isbn= 978-0262191913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming. 
:Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) interdisciplinary science on campus, pages 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.&lt;ref name=BESAC2008&gt;{{Cite report |last= Hemminger |first= John C. |date= August 2010 |title= Science for Energy Technology: Strengthening the Link between Basic Research and Industry |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carbcap&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Alivisatos |first1= Paul |last2= Buchanan |first2= Michelle |date= March 2010 |title= Basic Research Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020 |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (its ''processing'') influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the {{Section link||materials paradigm}}. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]] – investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].

==History==
{{Main|History of materials science}}
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are historic, if arbitrary examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and earlier from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom]]ic structure in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.

Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]], which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s "to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences."&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change? Solid State Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, and Materials Science|journal=Physics in Perspective|date=2015|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s00016-014-0151-7|pages=3–32|bibcode= 2015PhP....17....3M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field has since broadened to include every class of materials, including [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[polymer]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[magnetism|magnetic]] materials, [[medical implant]] materials, biological materials, and nanomaterials, with modern materials classed within 3 distinct groups: Ceramic, Metal or Polymer. The prominent change in materials science during the last two decades is active usage of computer simulation methods to find new compounds, predict various properties.

A material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html "For Authors: Nature Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234616/http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a myriad of materials around us—they can be found in anything from buildings to spacecraft. Materials can generally be further divided into two classes: [[crystal]]line and [[amorphous|non-crystalline]]. The traditional examples of materials are [[metal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[ceramic]]s and [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. "Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction" (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; New and advanced materials that are being developed include [[nanomaterials]], [[biomaterial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photovoltaic cell|energy materials]] to name a few.
 
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[Material properties|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

===Structure===
As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. [[Characterization (materials science)|Characterization]] is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with [[X-ray]]s, [[electron]]s, or [[neutron]]s, and various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[chemical analysis]] such as [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive spectroscopy]] (EDS), [[chromatography]], [[thermal analysis]], [[electron microscope]] analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various levels, as detailed below.

This deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms([[Å]]).
The way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.

====Nanostructure====
{{Main|Nanostructure}}
[[File:Buckminsterfullerene-perspective-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Buckminsterfullerene]] nanostructure.]]
Nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |author= Cristina Buzea |author2= Ivan Pacheco |author3= Kevin Robbie |last-author-amp= yes |title= Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity |journal= Biointerphases |volume= 2 |date= 2007 |pages= MR17–MR71 |doi= 10.1116/1.2815690 |pmid= 20419892 |issue= 4 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |archivedate= 2012-07-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.

In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the [[nanoscale]]. [[Nanotextured surface]]s have ''one dimension'' on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Nanotubes have ''two dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticle]]s have ''three dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and [[ultrafine particle]]s (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called [[ultrastructure]].

Materials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.

====Microstructure====
{{Main|Microstructure}}
[[File:Pearlite.jpg|thumb|right|Microstructure of pearlite.]]
Microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification. It deals with objects from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.

The manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain [[crystallographic defect|defects]] such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall–Petch|Hall–Petch relationship]]), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects, so that they can be studied, with significant advances in simulation resulting in exponentially increasing understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.

====Macro structure====
Macro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters—it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.

===Crystallography===
{{Main|Crystallography}}
[[File:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|Crystal structure of a perovskite with a chemical formula ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Energetics and Crystal Chemical Systematics among Ilmenite, Lithium Niobate, and Perovskite Structures |author= A. Navrotsky |journal= Chem. Mater. |date= 1998 |volume= 10 |issue= 10 |pages= 2787–2793 |doi= 10.1021/cm9801901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.
Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. [[Polymer]]s display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. [[Glass]], some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bonding}}
To obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of [[quantum chemistry]] or [[quantum physics]]. [[Solid-state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]] and [[physical chemistry]] are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.

===Properties===
{{Main|List of materials properties}}
Materials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.
:*Mechanical properties, see [[Strength of materials]]
:*Chemical properties, see [[Chemistry]]
:*Electrical properties, see [[Electricity]]
:*Thermal properties, see [[Thermodynamics]]
:*Optical properties, see [[Optics]] and [[Photonics]]
:*Magnetic properties, see [[Magnetism]]
The properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.

===Synthesis and processing===
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.

Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science named ''physical [[metallurgy]]''. Also, chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[thin film]]s, etc. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as [[graphene]].

===Thermodynamics===
{{Main|Thermodynamics}}
[[File:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]
Thermodynamics is concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints, that are common to all materials, not the peculiar properties of particular materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, [[statistical mechanics]].

The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.

===Kinetics===
{{Main|Chemical kinetics}}
[[Chemical kinetics]] is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. [[Diffusion]] is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change.

Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.

==In research==
Materials science has received much attention from researchers. In most universities, many departments ranging from [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[chemical engineering]], along with materials science departments, are involved in materials research. Research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues. The following list is in no way exhaustive. It serves only to highlight certain important research areas.

===Nanomaterials===
{{Main|Nanomaterials}}
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meter) but is usually 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm.

Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to [[nanotechnology]], leveraging advances in materials [[metrology]] and synthesis which have been developed in support of [[microfabrication]] research.  Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.

The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[nanocrystal]]s, etc.

===Biomaterials===
{{Main|Biomaterial}}
[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The iridescent [[nacre]] inside a [[nautilus]] shell.]]
A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. The study of biomaterials is called ''bio materials science''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]], and materials science.

Biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, [[polymer]]s, [[bioceramic]]s, or [[composite material]]s. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a [[heart valve]], or may be [[Biological activity|bioactive]] with a more interactive functionality such as [[hydroxylapatite]] coated [[hip implant]]s. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an [[autograft]], [[allograft]] or [[xenograft]] used as an [[organ transplant]] material.

===Electronic, optical, and magnetic===

Semiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.

[[Semiconductor]]s are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]] and [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations, and this allows for the use of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.

This field also includes new areas of research such as [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials, [[spintronics]], [[metamaterial]]s, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and [[solid-state physics]] or [[condensed matter physics]].

===Computational science and theory===
With the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials formerly unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by time-consuming trial and error processes. But, now it is hoped that computational methods could drastically reduce that time, and allow tailoring materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as [[density functional theory]], [[molecular dynamics]], etc.

==In industry==
Radical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[Microprobe|nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).

Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.

===Ceramics and glasses===
{{Main|Ceramic}}
[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ceramic bearing parts]]
Another application of material science is the structures of [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]] typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.

Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.

===Composites===
{{Main|Composite material}}
[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A 6 μm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite material]]s.
Another application of materials science in industry is making [[composite material]]s. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to {{convert|1510|C|F}} and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].

Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.

===Polymers===
{{Main|Polymer}}
[[File:Polypropylene.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene]]
[[File:Expanded polystyrene foam dunnage.jpg|thumb|Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging.]]
[[Polymer]]s are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s and also rubbers which have been around are natural rubber, [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber, [[chloroprene]], and [[butadiene rubber]]. Plastics are generally classified as ''commodity'', ''specialty'' and [[engineering plastic|''engineering'' plastics]].

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]], and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term "additives" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.

[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.

Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.

The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.

===Metal alloys===
{{Main|Alloy}}
[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Wire rope made from [[steel]] alloy.]]
The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.

===Semiconductors===

The study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A [[semiconductor]] is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and insulator. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities or doping. From these semiconductor materials, things such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), and analog and digital [[electric circuit]]s can be built, making them materials of interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a number—from a few to millions—of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604150127/https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the semiconductors in use today, [[silicon]] makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to silicon, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[gallium nitride]] and have various applications.

==Relation to other fields==
Materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as [[metallurgy]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

The field is inherently [[interdisciplinary]], and the materials scientists/engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. The field thus maintains close relationships with these fields. Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science.

The overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.

The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed before. Hence, there is a lot of science to be discovered when working with materials. Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed matter physics.

Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.

The '''Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik''' ("MPI for Nuclear Physics" or MPIK for short) is a
research institute in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]].

The institute is one of the 80 institutes of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] (Max Planck Society), an independent, non-profit research organization. The Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics was founded in 1958 under the leadership of Wolfgang Gentner. Its precursor was the Institute for Physics at the MPI for Medical Research.

Today, the institute's research areas are: crossroads of particle physics and astrophysics (astroparticle physics) and
many-body dynamics of atoms and molecules (quantum dynamics). There are five scientific divisions and several further research groups and junior groups. Scientific and technical departments as well as the administration support the researchers. The institute has about 390 employees, as well as many diploma students and scientific guests.

The research field of Astroparticle Physics, represented by the divisions of [[Werner Hofmann (physicist)|Werner Hofmann]] and [[Manfred Lindner]], combines questions related to macrocosm and microcosm. Unconventional methods of observation for gamma rays and neutrinos open new windows to the universe. What lies behind “dark matter” and “dark energy” is theoretically investigated.

The research field of Quantum Dynamics is represented by the divisions of [[Klaus Blaum]], [[Christoph Helmut Keitel|Christoph Keitel]] and [[Thomas Pfeifer]]. Using reaction microscopes, simple chemical reactions can be “filmed”. Storage rings and traps allow precision experiments almost under space conditions. The interaction of intense laser light with matter is investigated using quantum-theoretical methods.

Further research fields are cosmic dust, atmospheric physics as well as fullerenes and other carbon molecules.

Scientists at the MPIK collaborate with other research groups in Europe and all over the world and are involved in numerous international collaborations, partly in a leading role. Particularly close connections to some large-scale facilities like [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research|GSI]] (Darmstadt), [[DESY]] (Hamburg), [[CERN]] (Geneva), [[TRIUMF]] (Canada), and [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN]]-[[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|LNGS]] (Assergi L‘Aquila) exist.

In the local region, the Institute cooperates closely with the University of Heidelberg, where the directors and further members of the Institute are teaching. Three International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) and a graduate school serve to foster young scientists.

The institute operates accelerators (12 MeV Tandem, 15 MeV high-current injector, 25 MeV linear postaccelerator) injecting highly charged atomic ions or molecular ions into a storage ring (TSR). The electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) is able to produce and store 78-fold charged mercury ions.

'''Middlebury College''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]]. It was founded in 1800 by [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]], making it the first operating college or university in [[Vermont]]. The college currently enrolls 2,526 undergraduates from all 50 states and 74 countries and offers 44 majors in the arts, humanities, literature, foreign languages, social sciences, and natural sciences.

The college is the first American institution of higher education to have granted a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating [[Alexander Twilight]] in the class of 1823.&lt;ref name="Twilight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/twilight-bio |title=Alexander Twilight |publisher=Old Stone House Museum |language= |accessdate=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Middlebury was also one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in [[New England]] to become a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women. In 1886, May Belle Chellis was the first woman to graduate, and she was the valedictorian (although she was not allowed to address the graduating class because she was a woman). Middlebury was listed as tied for the fifth-best liberal arts college in the U.S. in the 2019 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rankings.&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges|title=2019 Best National Liberal Arts Colleges|last=|first=|date=|year=2018|website=|publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middlebury's 31 varsity teams are known as the [[Middlebury Panthers]] and compete in the [[NCAA Division III]]'s [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|NESCAC]] conference. The school is known for [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|its graduate programs]] that focus on literature, language, political science, and entrepreneurship.

==History==

===19th century===
[[File:Gamaliel Painter.jpg|thumb|[[Gamaliel Painter]] (1742–1819), founder of Middlebury College]]
[[File:old chapel wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Old Chapel with the [[Green Mountains]] in the distance]]
Middlebury received its founding charter on November 1, 1800, as an outgrowth of the ''Addison County Grammar School'', which had been founded three years earlier in 1797. The College's first president—[[Jeremiah Atwater]]—began classes a few days later, making Middlebury the first operating college or university in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Kingsley et al., "The College and the Church," ''New Englander and Yale Review'' '''11''' (Feb 1858): 600. [https://books.google.com/books?id=42dJAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=first%20graduate%20of%20the%20university%20of%20vermont&amp;pg=PA600#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false accessed 2010-6-16] Note: Middlebury is considered the first "operating" college in Vermont as it was the first to hold classes in Nov 1800. It issued the first Vermont degree in 1802; UVM followed in 1804.&lt;/ref&gt; One student named Aaron Petty graduated at the first commencement held in August 1802.&lt;ref name="CollegeCampus" /&gt; The College's founding religious affiliation was loosely [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]]. Yet the idea for a college was that of town fathers rather than clergymen, and Middlebury was clearly "the Town's College" rather than the Church's. Chief among its founders were [[Seth Storrs]] and [[Gamaliel Painter]], the former credited with the idea for a college&lt;ref name="VermontHistorySumFal01"&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert
|last=Firm |url=http://www.vermonthistory.org/journal/69/vt693_402.pdf |title=Seth Storrs, Congregationalism, and the Founding of Middlebury College |work=Vermont History |date=Summer–Fall 2001
|accessdate=2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as its greatest early benefactor. In addition to receiving a diploma upon graduation, Middlebury graduates also receive a replica of Gamaliel Painter's cane. Painter bequeathed his original cane to the College and it is carried by the College President at official occasions including first-year convocation and graduation. [[Alexander Twilight]], class of 1823, was the first black graduate of any college or university in the United States; he also became the first African American elected to public office, joining the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] in 1836. At its second commencement in 1804, Middlebury granted [[Lemuel Haynes]] an [[Honorary degree|honorary master's degree]], the first [[Master of Arts|advanced degree]] ever bestowed upon an African American.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p29.html Africans in America/Part 2/Lemuel Haynes]. Pbs.org.

JBHE. Retrieved on 2010-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the trustees voted to accept women as students in the college, making Middlebury one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution. The first female graduate—May Belle Chellis—received her degree in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.middlebury.edu/chellis Chellis House | Middlebury]. Go.middlebury.edu.

The College's centennial in 1900 began a century of physical expansion beyond the three buildings of [[Old Stone Row]]. [[York and Sawyer]] designed the Egbert Starr Library (1900), a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifice later expanded and renamed the Axinn Center, and Warner Hall (1901). Growth in enrollment and the endowment led to continued expansion westward. McCullough Hall (1912) and Voter Hall (1913) featured gymnasium and laboratories, respectively, adopting Georgian Revival styling while confirming the campus standard of grey Vermont limestone, granite, and marble.&lt;ref name="CollegeCampus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://midddigital.middlebury.edu/walking_history/college_campus/page_3.html |title=The College Campus |publisher=A Walking History of Middlebury |accessdate=2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national fraternity [[Kappa Delta Rho]] was founded in Painter Hall on May 17, 1905. Middlebury College abolished fraternities in the early 1990s, but the organization continued on campus in the less ritualized form of a social house. Due to a policy at the school against single-sex organizations, the house was forced to coeducate during the same period as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdr.com/main.php|title=National Fraternity of Kappa Delta Rho|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Language School, founded in 1915 under the supervision of then-President [[John Martin Thomas]], began the tradition of the [[Middlebury College Language Schools]]. These Schools, which take place on the Middlebury campus during the summer, enroll about 1,350 students in the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish Language Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/ls/hebrew|title=Hebrew Program at Middlebury – Intensive Hebrew Summer Program|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middlebury President [[Paul Dwight Moody]] began the American tradition of a [[National Christmas Tree]] in 1923 when the College donated a 48-foot [[balsam fir]] for use at the White House.&lt;ref name="XmasTree"&gt;National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/1923-national-christmas-tree.htm ''1923 National Christmas Tree''] (December 23, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was illuminated when Calvin Coolidge, a Vermont native in the first year of his presidency, flipped an electric switch. The [[Bread Loaf School of English]], Middlebury's graduate school of English, was established at the College's [[Bread Loaf Mountain (Vermont)|Bread Loaf Mountain]] campus in 1920.&lt;ref name="Bread Loaf's History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/blse/about/history|title=Bread Loaf's History|publisher=Middlebury|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]] was established in 1926.

==Academics==
[[File:Middlebury VT - Middlebury College.jpg|left|thumb|Old Chapel, completed in 1836, served as Middlebury's primary academic building for a century]]
Founded in 1800, the college enrolls approximately 2,500 undergraduates from all 50 states and 70 countries. The college offers 40 undergraduate departments and programs. Middlebury was the first institution of higher education in the United States to offer an [[environmental studies]] major, establishing the major in 1965.&lt;ref name="ES-About the Program"/&gt;

The most popular majors at Middlebury by number of recent graduates are: [[economics]], [[international studies]], [[literature|English and American literatures]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[environmental studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/about/president/addresses/archive/bacc_2010|title=Baccalaureate 2010|publisher=Middlebury|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to 40 percent of graduating seniors choose a single major in a traditional academic discipline, and about 30 percent of students complete a double or joint major combining two disciplines. Another 30 percent of students major in one of the College's interdisciplinary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Undergraduate Majors &amp; Programs| url=http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ump/| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214073154/http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ump/| archivedate=2008-02-14| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic year follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course semesters in the autumn and spring plus a what is known as a "Winter Term" session in January. The Winter Term, often called "J-Term" for January Term, allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship. Winter Term courses are taught by a mix of traditional faculty and special instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.middlebury.edu/admissions/aap/handbook/academicinformation/node/293569|title = The 4-1-4 Calendar Year and Winter Term}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language schools===

{{Main|Middlebury College Language Schools}}

The Middlebury College Language Schools, which began with the establishment of the School of German in 1915, offer intensive instruction in 10 languages during six-, seven-, or eight-week summer sessions. The schools enroll about 1,350 students every summer. The Schools all use an [[language immersion|immersion]]-based approach to language instruction and acquisition. All students in the Language Schools must sign and abide by Middlebury's "''Language Pledge''," a pledge to use their target language exclusively during the duration of their time at the School.&lt;ref name="Language Pledge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/ls/approach/pledge|title=Language Pledge|publisher=Middlebury|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middlebury's Language Schools have historically been conducted at the College's campus in Vermont. In the summer of 2009 the college opened a satellite campus at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]] to accommodate a growth in enrollment. For the summer of 2011, Middlebury at Mills will offer Arabic, French, Japanese, and Spanish instruction. Since the summer of 2015, Mills College in Oakland hosts the newly founded Middlebury School of Korean (2015), as well as the School of Arabic and the School of Italian.

 }}The {{Convert|350|acre|km2||adj=mid}} main campus is located in the [[Champlain Valley]] between [[Vermont]]'s [[Green Mountains (Vermont)|Green Mountains]] to the east and [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Adirondack Mountains]] to the west. The campus is situated on a hill to the west of the village of [[Middlebury (town), Vermont|Middlebury]], a traditional [[New England]] village centered on [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]] Falls.

Middlebury's campus is characterized by quads and open spaces, views of the Green Mountains and the Adirondacks, and historic granite, marble, and limestone buildings. ''[[Old Stone Row]]'', consisting of the three oldest buildings on campus—Old Chapel, Painter Hall, and Starr Hall—is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Painter Hall, constructed in 1815, is the oldest extant college building in Vermont. [[Emma Willard House]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], hosts the admissions office.

Since the mid-1990s, student housing has been grouped into five residential Commons: [[Jeremiah Atwater|Atwater]], [[Ezra Brainerd|Brainerd]], Cook, Ross, and Wonnacott. All are named for illustrious college figures. The creation of the Commons accompanied an increase in the size of the student body and an ambitious building campaign. Many new campus advancements include:
* {{convert|220000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[John McCardell Jr.]] Bicentennial Hall, a multidisciplinary science facility built to house the [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biochemistry]], [[Computer Science]], [[Geography]], [[Geology]], [[Physics]], and [[Psychology]] departments as well as the [[Environmental Studies]], [[Neuroscience]], and [[Molecular Biology]] programs (1999)

In the fall of 1994 the President and Board of Trustees of Middlebury College adopted a "One Percent for Art" policy. This decision set aside one percent of the cost of any renovation or new construction at the College for the purchase, installation, maintenance, and interpretation of works of art publicly displayed on campus. There are 19 works in Middlebury's campus public art collection, including ''[[Frisbee (sculpture)|Frisbee]],'' [[George Rickey]]'s ''[[Two Open Rectangles, Excentric, Variation VI (sculpture)|Two Open Rectangles, Excentric, Variation VI]],'' [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]]'s ''[[Smog (1/3)|Smog]]'', and a version of [[Robert Indiana]]'s ''[[Love (sculpture)|Love]]'' series.

In 2010, the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] and Middlebury College announced the creation of the Sustainable Investments Initiative, a co-mingled fiscal vehicle seeking investments that generate long-term social, environmental, and economic value. The Initiative will seek investments focused specifically on sustainability issues such as clean energy, water, climate science, and green building projects, in an effort to identify businesses positioned to become a part of the worldwide shift to improve energy efficiency, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate the effects of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Middlebury and Rockefeller Brothers Fund Sustainable Investments Initiative| url=http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/node/255685/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, Middlebury College and Integrated Energy Solutions, a Vermont developer of farm-based methane energy, agreed to explore a bio-methane gas collection and delivery system that could help Middlebury further reduce its use of fossil fuels. Middlebury has agreed to purchase bio-methane gas from IES over a 10-year period, with the agreement contingent on the college raising money to build storage facilities for the gas on campus and retrofit its current heating plant to burn the new fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Middlebury and IES Bio-Methane Agreement

'''Planetary migration''' occurs when a [[planet]] or other stellar satellite interacts with a disk of gas or [[planetesimal]]s, resulting in the alteration of the satellite's orbital parameters, especially its [[semi-major axis]].  Planetary migration is the most likely explanation for [[hot Jupiter]]s: [[extrasolar planets]] with [[giant planet|jovian]] masses but orbits of only a few days.  The generally accepted [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|theory of planet formation]] from a [[protoplanetary disk]] predicts such planets cannot form so close to their stars, as there is insufficient mass at such small radii and the temperature is too high to allow the formation of rocky or icy planetesimals.  It has also become clear that [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial-mass planet]]s may be subject to rapid inward migration if they form while the gas disk is still present. This may affect the formation of the cores of the giant planets (which have masses of the order of 10 Earth masses), if those planets form via the core accretion mechanism.

== Types of disk ==

=== Gas disk ===
Protoplanetary gas disks around young stars are observed to have lifetimes of a few million years. If planets with masses of around an Earth mass or greater form while the gas is still present, the planets can exchange [[angular momentum]] with the surrounding gas in the [[protoplanetary disk]] so that their orbits change gradually. Although the sense of migration is typically inwards in locally isothermal disks, outward migration may occur in disks that possess entropy gradients.

=== Planetesimal disk ===
During the late phase of planetary system formation, massive protoplanets and [[planetesimal]]s gravitationally interact in a chaotic manner causing many planetesimals to be thrown into new orbits. This results in angular-momentum exchange between the planets and the planetesimals, and leads to migration (either inward or outward). Outward migration of [[Neptune]] is believed to be responsible for the resonant capture of [[Pluto]] and other [[Plutino]]s into the 3:2 [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with Neptune.

== Types of migration ==

===Disk migration===

This type of orbital migration arises from the gravitational force exerted by a sufficiently massive body embedded in a disk on the surrounding disk's gas, which perturbs its density distribution. By the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]] principle of [[classical mechanics]], the gas exerts an equal and opposite gravitational force on the body, which can also be expressed in terms of a [[torque]]. This torque alters the [[angular momentum]] of the planet's orbit, resulting in a variation of the orbital elements, such as the [[semi-major axis]] (but all orbital elements can be affected). An increase over time of the semi-major axis leads to ''outward migration,'' i.e., away from the star, whereas the opposite behavior leads to ''inward migration''.

==== Type I migration ====

Small planets undergo Type I migration driven by torques arising from waves launched at the locations of the [[Lindblad resonance|Lindblad]] and from co-rotation resonances. Lindblad resonances excite spiral density waves in the surrounding gas, interior and exterior of the planet's orbit. In most cases, the outer spiral wave exerts a greater torque than does the inner wave, causing the planet to lose angular momentum, and hence migrate toward the star. The migration rate due to these torques is proportional to the mass of the planet and to the local gas density, and results in a migration timescale that tends to be short relative to the million-year lifetime of the gaseous disk.&lt;ref name=li2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubow|first=S.

Seager. |pages=347–371|date=2011|url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/Books/bid2263.htm| arxiv=1004.4137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional co-rotation torques are also exerted by gas orbiting with a period similar to that of the planet. In a reference frame attached to the planet, this gas follows [[horseshoe orbit]]s, reversing direction when it approaches the planet from ahead or from behind. The gas reversing course ahead of the planet originates from a larger semi-major axis and may be cooler and denser than the gas reversing course behind the planet. This may result in a region of excess density ahead of the planet and of lesser density behind the planet, causing the planet to gain angular momentum.&lt;ref name="Paadekooper_Mellema_2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paardekooper|first1=S.-J.|last2=Mellema|first2=G.|title=Halting type I planet migration in non-isothermal disks|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2006|volume=459|issue=1|pages=L17–L20|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20066304|arxiv=astro-ph/0608658|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2006/43/aa6304-06/aa6304-06.html|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...459L..17P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Bitsch|first2=B.|last3=Matsumura|first3=S.|title=Saving super-Earths: Interplay between pebble accretion and type I migration|date=2017|arxiv=1704.01962|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa6ba3|volume=153|issue=5|journal=The Astronomical Journal|page=222|bibcode=2017AJ....153..222B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet mass for which migration can be approximated to Type I depends on the local gas pressure scale-height and, to a lesser extent, the kinematic [[viscosity]] of the gas.&lt;ref name="li2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2010 /&gt; In warm and viscous disks, Type I migration may apply to larger mass planets.

==== Type II migration ====

A planet massive enough to open a gap in a gaseous disk undergoes a regime of migration referred to as Type II. When the mass of a perturbing planet is large enough, the tidal torque it exerts on the gas transfers angular momentum to the gas exterior of the planet's orbit, and does the opposite interior to the planet, thereby repelling gas from around the orbit. In a Type I regime, viscous torques can efficiently counter this effect by resupplying gas and smoothing out sharp density gradients. But when the torques become strong enough to overcome the viscous torques in the vicinity of the planet's orbit, a lower density annular gap is created. The depth of this gap depends on the temperature and viscosity of the gas and on the planet mass. In the simple scenario in which no gas crosses the gap, the migration of the planet follows the viscous evolution of the disk's gas. In the inner disk, the planet spirals inward on the viscous timescale, following the accretion of gas onto the star. In this case, the migration rate is typically slower than would be the migration of the planet in the Type I regime. In the outer disk, however, migration can be outward if the disk is viscously expanding. A Jupiter-mass planet in a typical protoplanetary disk is expected to undergo migration at approximately the Type II rate, with the transition from Type I to Type II occurring at roughly the mass of Saturn, as a partial gap is opened.&lt;ref name=dangelo_etal_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2008 /&gt; Type II migration is one explanation for the formation of [[hot Jupiter]]s.&lt;ref name="Armitage_2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Armitage|first1=Phillip J.|title=Lecture notes on the formation and early evolution of planetary systems|accessdate=|arxiv=astro-ph/0701485|bibcode=2007astro.ph..1485A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more realistic situations, unless extreme thermal and viscosity conditions occur in a disk, there is an ongoing flux of gas through the gap.&lt;ref name=lubow_dangelo_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubow|first=S.|author2=D'Angelo, G. |title=Gas Flow across Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2006|volume=641|issue=1|pages=526–533|doi=10.1086/500356|arxiv = astro-ph/0512292 |bibcode = 2006ApJ...641..526L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this mass flux, torques acting on a planet can be susceptible to local disk properties, akin to torques at work during Type I migration. Therefore, in viscous disks, Type II migration can be typically described as a modified form of Type I migration, in a unified formalism.&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2=Lubow, S.

=== Gravitational scattering ===
Another possible mechanism that may move planets over large orbital radii is gravitational scattering by larger planets or, in a protoplantetary disk, gravitational scattering by over-densities in the fluid of the disk.&lt;ref name="cloutier"&gt;{{cite journal | author=R.

The planets can end on highly eccentric orbits with perihelia close to the star, enabling their orbits to be altered due to the tides they raise on the star. The eccentricities and inclinations of these planets are also excited during these encounters, providing one possible explanation for the observed eccentricity distribution of the closely orbiting exoplanets.&lt;ref name="Ford_Rasio_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Eric B.|last2=Rasio|first2=Frederic A.|title=Origins of Eccentric Extrasolar Planets: Testing the Planet-Planet Scattering Model|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2008|volume=686|issue=1|pages=621–636|doi=10.1086/590926|arxiv=astro-ph/0703163|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/590926/meta|bibcode=2008ApJ...686..621F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting systems are often near the limits of stability.&lt;ref name="Raymond_etal_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Barnes|first2=Rory|last3=Veras|first3=Dimitri|last4=Armitage|first4=Phillip J.|last5=Gorelick|first5=Noel|last6=Greenberg|first6=Richard|title=Planet-Planet Scattering Leads to Tightly Packed Planetary Systems|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2009|volume=696|issue=1|pages=L98-L101|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/L98|arxiv=0903.4700|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/L98/meta|bibcode=2009ApJ...696L..98R}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Nice model systems of exoplanets with an outer disk of planetesimals can also undergo dynamical instabilities following resonance crossings during planetesimal-driven migration.

=== Tidal migration ===
Tides between the star and planet modify the semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity of the planet. The tide of a planet orbiting near a star raises a bulge on the star. If the star's rotational period is longer than the planet's orbital period the location of the bulge lags behind a line between the planet and the center of the star creating a torque between the planet and the star. As a result, the planet loses angular momentum and its semi-major axis decreases with time. If the planet is in an eccentric orbit the strength of the tide is stronger when it is near perihelion. The planet is slowed the most when near perihelion, causing its aphelion to decrease faster than its perihelion, reducing its eccentricity. Unlike disk migration which lasts a few million years until the gas dissipates tidal migration continues for billions of years. Tidal evolution of close-in planets produces semi-major axes typically half as large as they were at the time that the gas nebula cleared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0716 Tidal Evolution of Close-in Extra-Solar Planets], Brian Jackson, Richard Greenberg, Rory Barnes, (Submitted on 4 Jan 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kozai cycles and tidal friction===
The orbit of a planet that has an orbit that is inclined relative to the plane of a binary star can shrink due to a combination of Kozai cycles and tidal friction. Interactions with the more distant star cause the planets orbit to undergo an exchange of eccentricity and inclination due to the Kozai mechanism. This process can increase the planet's eccentricity and lowers its perihelion enough to create strong tides between the planet on the star increases. When it is near the star the planet loses angular momentum causing its orbit to shrink. The planet's eccentricity and inclination cycle repeatedly slowing the evolution of the planets semi-major axis.&lt;ref name="Fabrycky_Tremaine_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fabrycky|first1=Daniel|last2=Tremaine|first2=Scott|title=Shrinking Binary and Planetary Orbits by Kozai Cycles with Tidal Friction|journal=The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 669, Issue 2, pp. 1298–1315|date=2007|volume=669|issue=2|pages=1298–1315|doi=10.1086/521702|arxiv=0705.4285|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521702/meta|bibcode=2007ApJ...669.1298F}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the planet's orbit shrinks enough to remove it from the influence of the distant star the Kozai cycles end. Its orbit will then shrink more rapidly as it is tidally circularized. The orbit of the planet can also become retrograde due to this process. The Kozai cycles can also occur in a system with two planets that have differing inclinations due to gravitational scattering between planets and can result in planets with retrograde orbits.&lt;ref name="Noaz_etal_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoz|first1=Smadar|last2=Farr,|first2=Will M.|last3=Lithwick|first3=Yoram|last4=Rasio|first4=Frederic A.|last5=Teyssandier|first5=Jean|title=Hot Jupiters from secular planet-planet interactions|journal=Nature|date=2011|volume=473|issue=7346|pages=187–189|doi=10.1038/nature10076|arxiv=1011.2501|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/full/nature10076.html|bibcode=2011Natur.473..187N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nagasawa_etal_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagasawa|first1=M.|last2=Ida|first2=S.|last3=Bessho|first3=T.|title=Formation of Hot Planets by a Combination of Planet Scattering, Tidal Circularization, and the Kozai Mechanism|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2008|volume=678|issue=1|pages=498–508|doi=10.1086/529369|arxiv=0801.1368|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/529369/meta|bibcode=2008ApJ...678..498N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetesimal-driven migration===
The orbit of a planet can change due to gravitational encounters with a large number of planetesimals. Planetesimal-driven migration is the result of the accumulation of the transfers of angular momentum during encounters between the planetesimals and a planet. For individual encounters the amount of angular momentum exchanged and the direction of the change in the planet's orbit depends on the geometry of the encounter. For a large number of encounters the direction of the planet's migration depends on the average angular momentum of the planetesimals relative to the planet. If it is higher, for example a disk outside the planet's orbit, the planet migrates outward, if it is lower the planet migrates inward. The migration of a planet beginning with a similar angular momentum as the disk depends on potential sinks and sources of the planetesimals. For a single planet system planetesimals can only be lost (a sink) due to their ejection, which would cause the planet to migrate inward. In multiple planet systems the other planets can act as sinks or sources. Planetesimals can be removed from the planet's influence after encountering an adjacent planet or transferred to its influence by that planet. These interactions cause the planet's orbits to diverge as the outer planet tends to remove planetesimals with larger momentum from the inner planet influence or add planetesimals with lower angular momentum, and vice versa. The planet's resonances, where the eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up until they intersect with the planet, also act as a source. Finally, the planet's migration acts as both a sink and a source of new planetesimals creating a positive feedback that tends to continue its migration in the original direction. Planetesimal-driven migration can be damped if a planetesimals are lost to various sinks faster than new ones are encountered due to its sources or sustained if the new planetesimals enter its influence faster than they are lost. If sustained migration is due to its migration only it is called runaway migration, if it due to the loss of planetesimals to another planets influence it its is called forced migration&lt;ref name="Levison_etal_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levison|first1=H.

==Resonance capture==
The migration of planets can lead to planets being captured in resonances and chains of resonances if their orbits converge.

The migration of the outer planets is a scenario proposed to explain some of the orbital properties of the bodies in the Solar System's outermost regions.&lt;ref name=Levinson2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Harold F.

At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the [[solar nebula]] dispersed, because the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100&amp;nbsp;AU,&lt;ref name=Levinson2007/&gt; and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt;

According to this scenario the Kuiper belt was originally much denser and closer to the Sun: it contained millions of planetesimals, and had an outer edge at approximately 30&amp;nbsp;AU, the present distance of Neptune. After the [[formation of the Solar System]], the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn divergently crossed the 2:1 [[orbital resonance]], in which Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levinson2007" /&gt; This resonance crossing increased the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn and destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Encounters between the planets followed causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the dense planetesimal belt. The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while moving outwards themselves. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug01/bombardment.html |title=Uranus, Neptune, and the Mountains of the Moon |work= Planetary Science Research Discoveries |date=21 August 2001 |author=G. Jeffrey Taylor |publisher=Hawaii Institute of Geophysics &amp;amp; Planetology |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. This scattering scenario explains the trans-Neptunian populations' present low mass. In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not believed to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the [[Late Heavy Bombardment|period of giant impacts]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genesis of Planets |author=Douglas N.

'''''Print Quarterly''''' is an international [[academic journal]] devoted to the history and art of [[printmaking]], from its origins to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is published in [[London]] four times a year, in March, June, September, and December. It was founded in 1984 by the scholar, patron of the arts and business man [[David Landau (venture capitalist)|David Landau]], who served as editor for twenty-eight years. The current editor [[Rhoda Eitel-Porter]] joined the staff of the periodical in September 2010. The journal’s editorial board comprises notable academics and curators working in prints history and the [[graphic arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printquarterly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal publishes recent scholarship on all things related to prints. It covers the [[old master print|Western tradition]] in the graphic arts as well as Asian, Latin-American and African printmaking. Articles consider the role and import of the print from a number of perspectives including those of social and cultural history, iconography, biography, and collecting. Reviews of recent books related to the graphic arts and of catalogues of exhibitions of works on paper are also included.

Recent contributions have treated such diverse subjects as [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]], the influence of a seventeenth-century fencing manual, [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]], a quiz on an unidentified etching, the collector [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], Soviet and Vietnamese posters, [[Jim Dine]], comic strips, [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[William Kentridge]] and digital prints.

The content lists for each volume from 1984 to 2009 are published online and can be searched at the journal’s website, http://www.printquarterly.com, and through the [[Getty Research Institute]]'s Bibliography for the History of Art.&lt;ref&gt;For content through 2007, see http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/bha/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''''' (''PRIA'') is the journal of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], founded in 1785 to promote the study of [[science]], [[polite literature]], and [[antiquities]]. It was known as several titles over the years:
*1836-1866: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''
*1870-1884: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Science''
*1879: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Polite Literature and Antiquities''
*1889-1901: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''

In 1902, the journal split into three sections ''Section A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences'', ''Section B: Biological, Geological, and Chemical Science'' and ''Section C: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''. ''Section A'' is now published as ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' since 1998, and ''Section B'' is now published as ''Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''. ''Section C'' is now ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''.

'''Science Policy Research Unit''' (SPRU) is a research centre based at [[University of Sussex]] in [[Falmer]], near Brighton, UK. It focuses on long term transformative change, [[science policy]] and [[innovation]] across different sectors, societies and structures. It was one of the first interdisciplinary research centres in the field of science and technology policy and at the forefront of the development of innovation as an academic discipline. Alongside internationally renowned research, SPRU also offers a range of [[MSc]] courses, as well as PhD research degrees.

SPRU’s research today addresses pressing global policy agendas, including the future of industrial policy, inclusive economic growth; the politics of scientific expertise, energy policy, security issues, entrepreneurship, and pathways to a more sustainable future. It aims to tackle real-world questions whilst also contributing to theoretical knowledge on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/campus-close-up-university-of-sussex/2019748.article|title=Times Higher Education: Interview with Johan Schot|author=Holly Else|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, SPRU ranked 3rd in the world for top science and technology think tanks on the Global Go ToThink Tank Index Report which was put together by the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=think_tanks&lt;/ref&gt;

SPRU has 70 plus faculty members and more than 180 MSc and 80 doctoral students. With an extensive global alumni network among senior science and technology policy makers, SPRU is committed to engagement and generating impact at all stages of research. Members of SPRU work closely with government and parliament, think tanks, media, business and the third sector, and are experienced in disseminating and applying their latest research findings.

==Organization==
The Science Policy Research Unit is located within the School of Business, Management and Economics at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. SPRU’s current Director is [[:nl:Johan Schot|Professor Johan Schot]], formerly Professor of History of Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. He took over from Professor Gordon Mackerron in January 2014, and launched a new strategy in October 2014 with a focus on long-term transformative change.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/oct/24/transforming-innovation-policy|author=Johan Schot|title=Transforming innovation policy|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Jubilee Building.jpg|thumb|The Jubilee Building, where SPRU is currently based]]

SPRU is also home to a number of specialist research centres including:
*Sussex Energy Group
*Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (in partnership with the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Manchester|Manchester]])
*The STEPS Centre (Co-hosted with the Institute of Development Studies)
*The Nexus Network (with the universities of [[University of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]), 
*Harvard Sussex Program (a long-standing partnership with [[Harvard University]] in the field of biological and chemical weapons)

==History==
SPRU was founded in 1966 by Professor [[Christopher Freeman]], a pioneer of what is known as innovation studies today. Professor Freeman ‘embraced an ‘economics of hope’ which embodied a positive view of our potential to direct innovation, creativity and new technologies towards more sustainable and inclusive futures’.&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt;

Since its foundation SPRU has had (and continues to have) a long list of highly regarded scholars among its faculty including [[Daniele Archibugi]], [[Giovanni Dosi]], [[Marie Jahoda]], [[Carlota Perez]], [[Keith Pavitt]], [[Mary Kaldor]], [[Richard R. Nelson]], [[Giorgio Sirilli]] and [[Luc Soete]], former Rector Magnificus of [[Maastricht University]]. Current faculty members include prize-winning economist [[Mariana Mazzucato]], author of the Entrepreneurial State and winner of the 2014 New Statesman SPERI Prize;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2014/10/mariana-mazzucato-wins-new-statesman-speri-prize-political-economy|title=2014 New Statesman SPERI Prize|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Johan Schot (SPRU Director), series editor of Making Europe; James Wilsdon, Guardian writer and former Director of Science Policy at the [[Royal Society]]; Ben Martin, editor of [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/research-policy/ Research Policy] and Associate Fellow of Cambridge’s [[Centre for Science and Policy]].

==Current Research Priorities==
SPRU Research activities are extremely diverse, and are grouped into four main research themes:

1, Science, Politics and Decision Making: Researchers at SPRU apply a deep historical understanding to how the choices made about science and technology shape our societies. They also work on the politics of expertise, and on issues of foresight, research assessment, metrics and impact in today’s research environment.

2, Energy, Sustainability and Development: Since the 1970s SPRU has been at the heart of international debates about the role of science, technology and innovation in fostering sustainability and development. SPRU’s aim is to help organisations, industries and policy makers ensure that appropriate technologies and innovations are developed and deployed to produce positive effects.

3, Economics of Innovation and Industrial Policy: Researchers at SPRU seek to understand the structure and dynamics of innovating firms and industrial systems and how to manage innovation capabilities in firms, including research and technology change in high-tech industries and managing uncertainty in complex systems.

4, Technology and Innovation Management: SPRU’s work includes analysis of technology strategy, new technology based firms, complex systems and products, high-growth new ventures, as well as looking at innovation in different business models and sectors, including infrastructure, healthcare, biopharmaceuticals and services.

==Studying at SPRU/Teaching==
From technology policy and managing innovation, to fostering sustainability, international development and understanding complex energy systems, students at SPRU benefit from working at the frontier of new knowledge on some of today’s most pressing global policy agendas. SPRU offers problem-led, rather than discipline-based teaching.

==Harvard Sussex Program==
The '''Harvard Sussex Program''' (HSP) is a collaborative effort on chemical biological weapons disarmament between [[Harvard University]] and Science and Technology Policy Research (SPRU) at [[Sussex University]]. It was formed by its two directors, [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Julian Perry Robinson]] to provide research, training, seminars, and information work on chemical biological warfare and its disarmament.

The program publishes a quarterly newsletter ''The CBW Conventions Bulletin''.

The program is well known for its unique large archival collection of CBW related documents at Sussex (SHIB - Sussex Harvard Information Bank).

HSP is an academic Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that has influenced policy creation from within the United States and [[Great Britain]] on the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and reviews of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).

The '''Shunt equation''' quantifies the extent that [[venous blood]] bypasses [[Oxygen saturation|oxygenation]] in the  [[capillary|capillaries]] of the [[lung]].

Shunt and [[dead space (physiology)|dead space]] are terms used to describe conditions where either blood flow or ventilation does not meet the other in the lung as it should for gas exchange to take place.  They can also be used to describe areas or effects where blood flow and ventilation are not properly matched though both may be present to varying extents. Some refer to shunt-effect or dead space-effect to designate the [[ventilation/perfusion mismatch]] states that are less extreme than absolute shunt or dead space.

The following equation relates the percentage of blood flow that is not exposed to inhaled gas, called the shunt fraction &lt;math&gt;Q_s/Q_t&lt;/math&gt;, to the content of oxygen in venous, arterial, and pulmonary capillary blood.

:&lt;math&gt;Q_s/Q_t = (Cc_{O_2} - Ca_{O_2}) / (Cc_{O_2} - Cv_{O_2})&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref&gt;Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials, '''J. West''', 2005, 7th ed, Page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=J. M.|last2=Tikrell|first2=M. F.|last3=Stricklaxd|first3=D. a. P.|date=1969-04-01|title=Simplified Versions of the Shunt and Oxygen Consumption Equations|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1964340|journal=Anesthesiology|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=468–470|issn=0003-3022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Where:
:''Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Pulmonary Physiologic Shunt (mL/min)
:''Q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Cardiac Output (mL/min)
:''C&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = End-pulmonary-capillary Oxygen Content
:''C&lt;sub&gt;aO2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Arterial oxygen content
:C&lt;sub&gt;VO2&lt;/sub&gt; = Mixed Venous Oxygen Content

== Derivation ==
The blood entering the pulmonary system will have oxygen flux &lt;math&gt;Q_t \cdot Cv_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Cv_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt; is [[oxygen]] content of the venous blood and &lt;math&gt;Q_t&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[cardiac output]].

Similarly, the blood emerging from the pulmonary system will have oxygen flux &lt;math&gt;Q_t \cdot Ca_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Ca_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt; is [[oxygen]] content of the arterial blood.

This will be made up of blood that bypassed the lungs (&lt;math&gt;Q_s&lt;/math&gt;) and that which went through the pulmonary capillaries (&lt;math&gt;Q_c&lt;/math&gt;).
We can express this as 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q_t = Q_s + Q_c&lt;/math&gt;.

We can solve for &lt;math&gt;Q_c&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q_c = Q_t - Q_s&lt;/math&gt;.

If we add the oxygen content of Qs to Qc we get the oxygen content of Qt:

&lt;math&gt;Q_t \cdot Ca_{O_2} = Q_s \cdot Cv_{O_2} + (Q_t - Q_s) \cdot Cc_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Substitute Qc as above, CcO2 is the oxygen content of pulmonary (alveolar) capillary blood.

&lt;math&gt;Q_t \cdot Ca_{O_2} = Qs \cdot Cv_{O_2} + Q_t \cdot Cc_{O_2} - Qs \cdot Cc_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiply out the brackets.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q_s \cdot Cc_{O_2} - Qs \cdot Cv_{O_2} = Q_t \cdot Cc_{O_2} - Qt \cdot Ca_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the Qs terms and the Qt terms on the same side.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q_s \cdot (Cc_{O_2} - Cv_{O_2}) = Q_t \cdot (Cc_{O_2} - Ca_{O_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factor out the Q terms.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dfrac {Q_s} {Q_t} = \dfrac {Cc_{O_2} - Ca_{O_2}} {Cc_{O_2} - Cv_{O_2}}&lt;/math&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Divide by Qt and by (CcO2 - CvO2).

The term '''social criticism''' often refers to a mode of criticism that locates the reasons for malicious conditions in a society considered to be in a flawed [[social structure]]. It may also refer to people adhering to a social critic's aims at practical solutions by way of specific measures either for consensual [[reform]] or powerful [[revolution]].

== European roots ==
[[Religious persecution]] was common in Europe and was the reason for many physical and mental exoduses within the continent. Through such experiences, one of the first documents of social criticism was born: the [[Jean Meslier#Social Criticism|''Testament'' of Jean Meslier]].

== Protest experience with political theories==
Repression experienced by a [[minority group|minority]] often leads to [[protest]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Without sufficient resolution of the dispute, a social criticism can be formulated, often covered by political groups (political [[monopoly]]). For protesting people ''within'' a [[social movement]], it is often frustrating to [[experience]] failure of the movement and its own agenda.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[positivism dispute]] between [[critical rationalism]], e.g. between [[Karl Popper]] and  the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amico|first=Robert|date=1990-12-21|title=Karl Popper and the Frankfurt School|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1990/86/33|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1990|issue=86|pages=33–48|doi=10.3817/1290086033|issn=0090-6514}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the academic form of the same discrepancy. This dispute deals with the question of whether research in the [[social sciences]] should be "neutral" or consciously adopt a partisan view.

==Academic forms==
Academic works of social criticism can belong to  [[social philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychoanalysis]] but also [[cultural studies]] and other disciplines or reject academic forms of [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hhh.gavilan.edu/kwarren/LitCrit.html|title=Types of Literary Criticism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and music==
{{see also|Literary criticism}}
Social criticism can also be expressed in a fictional form, e.g. in a revolutionary novel like ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' by [[Jack London]] or in [[dystopia]]n [[novel]]s like  [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) or [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) or [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), or [[Rafael Grugman]]'s ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008), [[children's books]] or films.

Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] furthered the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]] in the United States, and the 1885 novel ''[[Ramona]]'', by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], brought about changes in laws regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Similarly, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' helped create new laws related to public health and food handling, and [[Arthur Morrison]]'s 1896 novel ''A Child of the Jago'' caused England to change its housing laws. George Orwell and [[Charles Dickens]] wrote ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature. ''Animal Farm'', written in 1944, is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in  which the farm animals revolt against their human masters. It is an  example of social criticism in literature in which Orwell satirized  the events in Russia after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. He anthropomorphises the animals, and alludes each one to a counterpart  in [[Russian history]]. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' also typifies this kind of literature. Besides the central theme of love, is another prevalent theme, that of a revolution gone bad. He shows us that, unfortunately, human nature causes us to be vengeful and, for some of us, overly ambitious. Both these books are similar in that both describe how, even with the best of intentions, our ambitions get the best of us. Both authors also demonstrate that violence and the [[Machiavellian]] attitude of "the ends justifying the means" are deplorable. They also express their authors' disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature.

According to [[Frederick Douglass]], "Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."&lt;ref&gt;From Douglass´ speech in 1886 on the 24th anniversary of Emancipation, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors imply, that even if we begin with honourable intentions, there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control. ''Animal Farm'' portrays this nature through parodying events in real history. Given the right conditions, these events could happen anywhere. Take for example, a leader becoming overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power.

In ''A Tale of Two Cities'', Dickens examines the inner soul, and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions, where desperation and anger reign, and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside. Every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless, opportunistic being like Napoleon or Madame Defarge, if placed in the right place, at the right time.

Social criticism is certainly present in opera ([[The Cradle Will Rock]], [[Trouble in Tahiti]]) and other types of classical music, such as the [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No.13]], called "[[Babi Yar]]", of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. Other musical expressions of social criticism are  frequent in [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rap]] music, examples being [[Pretty Vacant|"Pretty Vacant"]] by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Brenda's Got a Baby|"Brenda's Got a Baby"]] by [[2Pac]]. Heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] also use social criticism extensively, particularly in their earlier works.

[[File:Streetlight 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[High pressure sodium lamp| A High pressure sodium street light]] fixture]]
'''Street light interference''' ('''SLI''') is a term coined by [[paranormal]] author [[Hilary Evans]] to denote the claimed ability of individuals to turn [[street light]]s or outside building [[security lighting|security lights]] on or off when passing near them. Believers in SLI allege that they experience it on a regular basis with specific lamps and more frequently than chance would explain; however, SLI has never been demonstrated to occur in a scientific experiment, and those who claim the ability have been found to be unable to reproduce the effect on demand.&lt;ref name=WaPost&gt;Linton Weeks. "Bad Karma, Or Just Bad Lightbulbs?; The Mystery Of Blinking Street Lights." [[The Washington Post]]. Washingtonpost Newsweek Interactive. 2002. [http://www.highbeam.com HighBeam Research]. 19 Sep. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Independent Investigations Group |title=Light Bulb Luminosity Demonstration |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/light_bulb_luminosity_demonstration |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center For Inquiry |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proponents ==
According to Evans, SLI is a phenomenon "based on claims by many people that they involuntarily, and usually spontaneously, cause street lamps to go out." Evans' 1993 book ''The SLI Effect'' proposes that the phenomenon is "not consistent with our current knowledge of how people interact with the physical world." Evans coined the term "SLIder" to refer to someone who allegedly causes this effect, and cites SLIders' claims of being able to "extinguish a row of [[sodium vapor lamp]]s in sequence, each one going out as the witnesses nears it."&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer" /&gt;

Some proponents believe static electricity or "some kind of “energy” emitted by the human body" is responsible for SLI. Others claim the alleged phenomenon is caused by individuals having [[psychic]] or [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt;

== Reception ==
Author [[Massimo Polidoro]] writing in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has considered claims of SLI to be examples of [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation not implying causation]], or of [[confirmation bias]]: people are much more likely to notice when a nearby street light turns on or off than they are to notice a light turning on or off at a distance, or a street light in a steady state at any distance. This is compounded by a failure mode of street lights, known as "cycling", in which street lights of the high pressure sodium type turn off and on more frequently at the end of their life cycle.&lt;ref name="straightdope"&gt;Cecil" Adams. [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_047.html "Can some people extinguish streetlamps by means of their bodily emanations?"] In "The Straight Dope", October 28, 1994. Retrieved April 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A high pressure sodium engineer at [[General Electric]], quoted by [[Cecil Adams]], summarizes SLI as "a combination of coincidence and wishful thinking".&lt;ref name="straightdope" /&gt; Polidoro notes that "Paranormal phenomenon is the least likely possibility."&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Lester R. Brown]], a prominent [[environmentalist]] and founder of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] and [[Earth Policy Institute]], describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Greg. [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown "An interview with Lester Brown"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227004714/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown |date=27 December 2016 }} ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrick Jensen]] ("the poet-philosopher of the [[ecological movement]]"), a celebrated American [[author]], [[radical environmentalist]] and prominent critic of [[Bright green environmentalism|mainstream environmentalism]] argues that "[[industrial civilization]] is not and can never be sustainable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-22|title=Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endgame_(Derrick_Jensen_books)&amp;oldid=786893218|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

Additionally, practical [[ecovillage]] builders like [[Living Villages]] maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local [[culture]] and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.

Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of [[sustainability]] to lifestyle choice and decisions.  One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www.epa.gov/Sustainability "What is sustainability?"] Retrieved on: 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]] (2005).

Retrieved on: 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected ''social'' domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or [[Circles of Sustainability]] conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable design]] and [[sustainable development]] are critical factors to sustainable living.

==Shelter==
[[Image:PA120016.JPG|thumb|right|240px|An example of ecological housing]]
On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' [[land use]].&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental Impact Assessment of Household Consumption|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/abstract|journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1530-9290|pages = 526–536|doi = 10.1111/jiec.12371|language = en|first = Diana|last = Ivanova|first2 = Konstantin|last2 = Stadler|first3 = Kjartan|last3 = Steen-Olsen|first4 = Richard|last4 = Wood|first5 = Gibran|last5 = Vita|first6 = Arnold|last6 = Tukker|first7 = Edgar G.|last7 = Hertwich|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Green building|Sustainable homes]] are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment.'' Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to “net“ out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment''. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainably designed (see [[Sustainable Design]]) houses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/greenbuilding/2010/05/18/what-is-a-sustainable-home-a-truly-green-home/|title=What is a Sustainable Home?

The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using [[Passive solar building design|passive solar lighting and heating]], creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton.

Many materials can be considered a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle.

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered "sustainable" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using [[sustainable forest management]], processed using [[sustainable energy]].  delivered by [[sustainable transport]], etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a [[Life-cycle assessment]].

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"/&gt;  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; “Superwindows,” mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution.'' Boston: Little, Brown and, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's [[albedo]] and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. [[Green roofs]] or “living roofs” are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical “footprint” that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building‘s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlip, Jamie.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, [[HVAC]] systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an [[Energy Star]] label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn How a Product Earns the ENERGY STAR Label : ENERGY STAR."] ENERGY STAR.

[[Greywater]], including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise, [[rainwater harvesting]] from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/natres/06702.html Graywater Reuse and Rainwater Harvesting].

As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment]. Consumer Reports: Expert Product Reviews and Product Ratings from Our Test Labs. Consumers Union of U.S., July 2007. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility’s effort in producing sustainable energy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate.

[[File:Solar panels in Ogiinuur.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An installation of [[solar panel]]s in rural Mongolia]]

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 19 October 2010. Web. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household‘s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&amp;nbsp;mi/hr (14&amp;nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth’s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth’s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"/&gt; Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth’s surface, making its production cost-effective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester Russell. Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to save Civilization. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today’s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''. Canada: New Society Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; “The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 [[calorie]]s of oil and other [[fossil fuel]]s to produce a single calorie of food.”&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"&gt;Astyk, Sharon. ''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt; Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"&gt;Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"&gt;Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt;

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"/&gt; Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"/&gt;

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as "an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.

===Urban gardening===
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|"Edible landscaping": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]
In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia’s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"/&gt; With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.&lt;ref&gt;Ciperthwaite, Wm. ''A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[food preservation]].

With rising [[peak oil]] concerns, [[climate warming]] exacerbated by [[carbon emissions]] and high energy prices, the conventional [[automobile industry]] is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpooling]] is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/science/the-bicycle-and-the-ride-to-modern-america.html|title=The Bicycle and the Ride to Modern America|date=13 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating [[Traffic congestion|congestion]], lowering [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]], and increasing [[physical exercise]]. Most importantly, they do not emit climate-disturbing [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"/&gt; [[Bike-sharing]] programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Stacey Guzman|title=Worldwide Bikesharing|journal=Access Magazine|year=2011|url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|archivedate=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike-sharing programs offer [[kiosks]] and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Guzman, S.|author3=H.

A recent boom has occurred in [[electric bicycles|electric bikes]] especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009" /&gt;  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.

==Water==
{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}
{{main|Water efficiency}}
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth’s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America’s freshwater withdrawals.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt;  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt; This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.

====Toilets====

[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program. US Environmental Protection Agency, 9 November 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

====Showers====

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers.   One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a "low flow" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]].   When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: "Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation," Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity.   A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul" /&gt; Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies®|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes – Resource Conservation – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

[[File:Wiki-oral-scrotum.png|thumb|A woman performing teabagging]]
'''Teabagging''' is a [[slang]] term for the [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] of a [[man]] placing his [[scrotum]] in the [[mouth]] of his [[sexual partner]] for [[pleasure]], or onto the [[face]] or [[head]] of another person, sometimes as a [[comedic device]].

The name of the practice, when it is done in a repeated in-and-out [[Motion (physics)|motion]], is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a [[tea bag]] into a [[cup]] of hot [[water]] as a method of [[Steeping|brewing]] [[tea]]. As a form of [[non-penetrative sex]], it can be done for its own [[enjoyment]] or as [[foreplay]]. The practice may also be performed during [[sexual assault]]. This practice was made popular in the 1990s video game ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', in which one player would repeatedly crouch over the opponent's dead body.

==Oral sex==
Along with the [[human penis|penis]], the scrotum is [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitive]] and considered to be an [[erogenous zone]]. This makes varying degrees of [[stimulation]] an integral part of [[oral sex]] for many men.&lt;ref name="Lip Service"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLeod |first1=Debra |last2=MacLeod |first2=Don |title=Lip Service: A His and Hers Guide to the Art of Oral Sex &amp; Seduction|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2009|pages=141–142|isbn=978-1-58542-696-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htH8JeSH9XwC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=tea%20bagging&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=tea%20bagging&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/eight-unique-oral-sex-techniques-6522.html|title=Eight unique oral sex techniques|last=Allison|first=Dr. Sadie|accessdate=4 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103061618/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/eight-unique-oral-sex-techniques-6522.html|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while some men may enjoy the stimulation, not every man responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-oconnell/2012/09/6-things-we-have-to-stop-doing-during-sex/|title=6 things we have to stop doing during sex|last=O'Connell|first=Ryan|date=September 6, 2010|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex experts have praised various techniques that the performer can use during [[fellatio]] to increase their partner's pleasure.

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H. P. |author2=Turner, James |title=Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1998 |page=3 |isbn=0-345-42204-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. S. Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9028">''Die Sechzehn Grundsätze des Städtebaus'', or ''The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design'', were from 1950 until 1955 the primary model for urban planning in the [[GDR]].

==Text==
''Decided by the Government of the German Democratic Republic on 27 July 1950:

''The urban planning and architectural design of our cities, which shall influence the construction of all of Germany, must express the social order of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the progressive traditions and great goals of our German people. They shall adhere to the following principles:

#''The city as a form of settlement did not arise by chance. The city is the richest economic and cultural form of community settlement, proven by centuries of experience. The city is in its structural and architectural design an expression of the political life and the national consciousness of the people.
#''The goal of urban planning is the harmonious fulfillments of man's basic rights to employment, housing, culture and recreation. The methodological principles of urban planning are based on the natural condition, on the social and economic foundations of the state, on the highest achievements of science, technology and art, on the needs of the economy, and on the use of progressive elements of the cultural heritage of the people.
#''Cities, per se, do not arise and do not exist. To a significant extent, cities are built by industry for industry. The growth of the city, the population, and the area are determined by city-forming factors, that is, from industry, governing bodies, and cultural sites, insofar as they have more than local significance. In the capital, industry as an urbanization factor is of secondary importance to administrative bodies and cultural sites. The precise discernment and codification of city-forming factors is a matter determined by government.
#''The growth of the city must be subordinate to efficacy and remain within certain limits. An overgrown city, its population, and its area lead to difficulties in eliminating tangles in their structure, lead to entanglements in the organization of cultural life and the daily care of the population, and lead to administrative complications, both in business and in the development of industry.
#''Urban planning must be based on the principles of organicism, and the consideration of a city's historical structure in eliminating that city's shortcomings.
#''The center forms the veritable core of the city. The center of the city is the political center for its population. In the city center are the most important political, administrative and cultural sites. On the squares in the city center one might find political demonstrations, marches and popular celebrations held on festival days. The center of the city shall be composed of the most important and monumental buildings, dominating the architectural composition of the city plan and determining the architectural silhouette of the city.
#''In cities that lie on a river, the river and its embankments shall be one of the main arteries and architectural axes of the city.
#''Traffic circulation has to serve the city and its population. It should neither divide the city nor be cumbersome to the general public. Through traffic should be removed from the center and central district and rerouted outside its borders or to an outer ring. Equipment for the carriage of goods, such as rail- and canal-ways, should also be kept away from the central district of the city. Determining locations for main roads must take into account the coherence and tranquility of residential districts. In determining the width of main roads, it is important to note that the width of these main thoroughfares is not of crucial importance to urban transportation, but rather as an outlet for crossroads in order to appropriately ease the demands of traffic flow.
#''The visage of the city-that is, its individual artistic form-shall be defined by squares, main streets, and prominent buildings in the center of the city (in those largest cities containing skyscrapers). Squares and plazas shall serve as the structural basis for the planning of the city and for its overall architectural composition.
#''Residential areas shall consist of housing districts, the cores of which shall be district centers. For the sake of the residents of these housing districts, in them shall be all necessary cultural, utility, and social services. The second aspect in the structuring of residential areas shall be the residential complex, which is formed by grouping together four housing structures, where there shall be located a central park, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries that serve the daily needs of the population. Urban transport must not be allowed within these residential areas, but neither the residential districts nor the residential complexes should be isolated entities in and of themselves. Latent in their structure and design are the demands of the city on a whole. The housing structures themselves function as a third aspect in the importance of complexes in planning and design.
#''Access to light and air are not the only determining factors for healthy and peaceful living conditions, but also population density and orientations, as well as the development of transportation systems.
#''It is impossible to transform a city into a garden. Of course, care must be taken to provide sufficient greenery, but the principle not to overturn is that in the city one lives urbanistically, whereas on the outskirts or outside the city one lives rurally.
#''The many storey high-rise is more economical than a one- or two-storey design. It also reflects the character of the metropolis.
#''Urban planning is the basis of architectural design. Central to urban planning and architectural design of a city is the creation of an individual and unique visage for that city. The architecture must embody both the progressive traditions as well as the past experiences of the people.
#''For urban planning, as for architectural design, there shall be no abstract scheme. Crucial are only the summarization of essential architectural factors and the demands of daily life.
#''Simultaneously and in accordance with the work on a city plan shall be completed designs for the planning and development of specific neighborhoods, as well as plazas and main street with neatly organized housing blocks, whose construction will be completed first.''

==Implementation==
By September 7, 1950, one day after the adoption of a national building law, the demolition of the heavily damaged Berlin City Palace began. The plan was to build a 90-meter wide stretch of road from the Frankfurter Straße via [[Alexanderplatz]], Königstraße (now Rathausstraße) and the street [[Unter den Linden]] to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. The "central axis" was to create a new representation Magistrale arise between the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, the center of the monumental height dominant - should be in place of the castle, the central government building - as a "city crown" the Marx-Engels-Platz. In 1951, [[Stalinallee]] emerged as the first Socialist avenue in the GDR. The first stages of construction was from 1952 to 1958, designed by [[Hermann Henselmann]], architect of [[Hochhaus an der Weberwiese]]. When the work at [[Frankfurter Tor]] was completed in 1960, the historicist style of the avenue was already outdated and perceived almost bashfully. Other major projects were in [[Dresden]] at the Altmarkt, in [[Leipzig]] on Roßplatz and at the Long Street realized in [[Rostock]]. 
From 1955 a new phase of urban development in the GDR took place after the [[Soviet Union]] adopted new directives for 1954 architecture, which called for greater standardization and the waiving of expensive ornamentation. The second phase of Stalinallee-between Strausberger Platz and [[Alexander Platz]]-was therefore built in an industrial aesthetic.

'''Waste minimisation''' is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of [[waste]] produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;  Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and production.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web|author=Davidson, G.|date=2011|title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review.|publisher=Retrieved from https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most environmentally resourceful, [[economic efficiency|economically efficient]], and [[cost effective]] way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most [[waste management]] strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.

Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on [[re-use]], [[recycling]],  and [[waste-to-energy]] conversion.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process, [[life cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave analysis]] (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.

The main sources of waste [[Waste by country|vary from country to country]]. In the [[UK]], most waste comes from the construction and [[demolition]] of buildings, followed by [[mining]] and quarrying, industry and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf ROYAL COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: Urban Environment] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the [[supply chain]].  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.

==Benefits==
Waste minimisation can [[environment protection|protect the environment]] and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;
*Efficient production practices.  Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of input of [[raw material]]s.
*Economic returns.  More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials improving the financial performance of a company.
*[[Reputation|Public image]].  The environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation reflects a proactive movement towards [[environmental protection]].
*Quality of products produced.  New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.
*[[Environmental responsibility]].  Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations, policies, and standards. The environmental impact of waste will be reduced.

==Industries==
In industry, using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.

Waste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.

There are government incentives for waste minimisation, which focus on the environmental benefits of adopting waste minimisation strategies. In the [[UK]], several pilot schemes such as The Catalyst Project and the Dee Waste Minimisation Project, have shown the efficacy of such policies. Fourteen companies in [[Merseyside]] took part in the Catalyst Project; the project generated overall savings of £9 million and landfill waste was reduced by 12,000 tonnes per year. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Processes==

: 
* [[Reuse]] of scrap material
: Scraps can be immediately re-incorporated at the beginning of the manufacturing line so that they do not become a waste product. Many industries routinely do this; for example, [[paper mill]]s return any damaged rolls to the beginning of the production line, and in the manufacture of plastic items, off-cuts and scrap are re-incorporated into new products.
* Improved [[quality control]] and [[process monitoring]]
: Steps can be taken to ensure that the number of reject batches is kept to a minimum.  This is achieved by increasing the frequency of inspection and the number of points of inspection. For example, installing automated continuous monitoring equipment can help to identify production problems at an early stage.
* Waste exchanges
: This is where the waste product of one process becomes the raw material for a second process. Waste exchanges represent another way of reducing waste disposal volumes for waste that cannot be eliminated.
* Ship to [[point of use]]
: This involves making deliveries of incoming [[raw material]]s or components direct to the point where they are assembled or used in the manufacturing process to minimise handling and the use of [[protective wrapping]]s or enclosures.
* [[Zero waste]]
: This is a whole systems approach that aims to eliminate waste at the source and at all points down the supply chain, with the intention of producing no waste. It is a design philosophy which emphasizes waste prevention as opposed to end of pipe waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickinson, J.|author2=Snow, W.K.|date=2001|last-author-amp=yes|title=The end of waste: Zero Waste by 2020.|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product design===

Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for [[Manufacturing|manufactured products]] can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of [[wikt:component|component]]s used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.

In some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of [[raw material]]s used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or [[toxicity]] of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section [[Waste minimisation#Durability|Durability]]).

====Fitting the intended use====
In this strategy, products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to packaging materials, which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of [[paper]], [[metal]]s, [[glass]] and [[plastic]]s in its packaging.

====Durability====
Improving [[durable goods|product durability]], such as extending a [[vacuum cleaner]]'s useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.

But in some cases it has a negative [[environmental impact]].  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed.  For example, a washing machine produced 10 years ago may use twice as much water, detergent and energy as one produced today. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.

Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Recycling a product is easier if it is constructed of fewer materials.  Car manufacturers have recently reduced the number of plastics used in their cars from twenty or more to three or four, {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} hence simplifying the recovery of plastics from scrapped cars. However, exceptions (like having a combination of paper and plastic or plastic coating on glass) do exist, and might enable a product to fulfill its role with the minimum of resources.

Making refillable glass [[bottle]]s strong enough to withstand several journeys between the [[consumer]] and the [[bottling plant]] requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..

Many choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.

==Retail==
Various aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of [[disposable tableware]] in restaurants.
===Reusable shopping bags===
Reusable bags are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a "bag credit" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least [[Kroger|one chain]] reversed its policy, claiming "it was just a temporary bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/kroger-ends-reusable-bag-discount Kroger ends reusable bag discount], WCPO TV, Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.&lt;ref name="brookingsbag"&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-a-bag-tax-works-better-than-a-reusable-bag-bonus/ Why a Bag Tax Works Better Than a Reusable Bag Bonus], Brookings Inst., 8-Jan-2014&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.

==Households==
This section details some waste minimisation techniques for [[household]]ers.

Appropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or [[can (disambiguation)#Container|can]] is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html Removing food remains to reduce waste]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home [[composting]], the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.

The resources that households use can be reduced considerably by [[electricity consumption|using electricity]] thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.

In a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow [[fashion trend]]s when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more [[convenience food|convenient foods]] that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.

The amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total [[resource consumption]].  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have [[eco-labelling]], which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Pullapart|PullApart]] combines both [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]], in a [[Curbside collection|curbside]] packaging [[recycling]] classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.

==Health-care facilities==

Health-care establishments are massive producers of waste.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2011|title=Waste from Health Care facilities Fact Sheet No 253|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs253/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of health-care waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Waste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.

===Practices===

There are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2014|title=Waste minimization, recycling and reuse.|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/058to060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[common law]], a '''writ''' (Anglo-Saxon ''gewrit'', Latin ''breve'')&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg ed., ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial [[jurisdiction]]; in modern usage, this body is generally a [[court]]. [[Warrant (legal)|Warrants]], [[prerogative writ]]s, and [[subpoena]]s are common types of writ, but many forms exist and have existed.

In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English monarch to a specified person to undertake a specified action; for example, in the [[Feudalism in England|feudal era]] a military summons by the king to one of his [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] to appear dressed for battle with retinue at a certain place and time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Palgrave]] (1788-1861), ''Parliamentary Writs and Writs of Military Summons'' (2 volumes, 1827 and 1834)&lt;/ref&gt; An early usage survives in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] in a [[writ of election]], which is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and, in Australia, by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] for elections for the House of Representatives, or State Governors for State elections) to local officials ([[High Sheriff]]s of every county in the historical UK) to hold a [[general election]]. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; (then consisting primarily of the [[House of Lords]]) whose advice was considered valuable or who were particularly influential, and who were thereby deemed to have been created "[[Hereditary peer|barons by writ]]".

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Habeas corpus]] --&gt;

===Origins===
The writ was a unique development of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, and consisted of a brief administrative order, authenticated (innovatively) by a seal.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Written in the vernacular, they generally made a land grant, or conveyed instructions to a local court. In the beginning, writs were the document issued by the King's Chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the King about an injustice, after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; [[William the Conqueror]] took over the system unchanged, but was to extend it in two ways: first, writs became mainly framed in Latin, not Anglo-Saxon; second, they covered an increasing range of royal commands and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors, but it was not until [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs could take two main forms, open (patent) for all to read, and 'letters close' for one or more specified individuals alone.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

The development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of "off-the-shelf" justice designed to enable the English law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures. The complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer, which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions.  The development was part of the establishment of a [[Court of Common Pleas]], for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown, for example: "someone has damaged my property". The previous system of justice at the royal court of Chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming. Thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary, in most cases, to have a case heard in one of the Royal Courts, such as the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] or [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]]. Some franchise courts, especially in the [[County Palatine|Counties Palatine]], had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs. The writ was "served" on (delivered in person to) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ, or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient.

Where a [[plaintiff]] wished to have a case heard by a local court, or by an [[Eyre (legal term)|Eyre]] if one happened to be visiting the County, there would be no need to obtain a writ. Actions in local courts could usually be started by an informal complaint. However, if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of Royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the King's courts, then he would need a writ, a command of the King, to enable him to do this. Initially for [[common law]], recourse to the King's courts was unusual, and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay. For most Royal Courts, the writ would usually have been purchased from the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], although the court of the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]], being in essence another government department, was able to issue its own writs.

While originally writs were exceptional, or at least non-routine devices, [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] suggests that by the time of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154-1189), the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in England.

At first, new writs were drafted to fit each new situation, although in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, and in most cases limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court, often controlled by a lesser [[nobility|noble]], and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.

Over time, opposition to the creation of new writs by the Chancery increased. For example, in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as "novel, unheard of, and against reason" (Abbot of Lilleshall v Harcourt (1256) 96 SS xxix 44). Ultimately in 1258 the King was forced to accept the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which among other things, prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the [[Curia Regis|King's council]]. New writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of Parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static, each writ defining a particular [[form of action]]. It was the role and expertise of a [[solicitor]] to select on his client's behalf the appropriate writ for the proposed legal action. These were purchased from the court by payment of a fee. A [[barrister]] would then be hired by the solicitor to speak for his client in court.

=== Rationalisation of writs ===

With the abolition of the Forms of Action in 1832 and 1833, a profusion of writs was no longer needed, and one uniform writ came into use. After 1852 the need to state the name of the form of action was also abolished. In 1875 the form of writ was altered so that it conformed more to the [[subpoena]] used in the Chancery. A writ was a summons from the Crown, to the parties to the action, with on its back the substance of the action set out, together with a 'prayer' requesting a remedy from the court (for example damages). In 1980 the need for writs to be written in the name of the Crown was ended. From that time, a writ simply required the parties to appear..&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court (Writ and Appearance) 1979 (Statutory Instrument 1979, No. 1716)[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1979/1716/made], discussed in House of Lords in 1980,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1980/feb/07/rules-of-the-supreme-court-writ-and]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed  part of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]]. The procedure in a [[County Court]], which was established by statute, was to issue a 'summons'.

In 1999 the [[Woolf Reforms]] unified most of the procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court in civil matters. These reforms brought in the Civil Procedure Rules. Under these almost all civil actions, other than those connected with insolvency, are now commenced by the completion of a 'Claim Form' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'Writ', 'Originating Application', or 'Summons' (see Rules 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules).

==Writ of election==
In some [[Westminster system]]s, for example Canada and some other [[parliament]]ary systems, the phrase '[[dropping the writ]]' refers colloquially to a [[dissolution of parliament]] and the beginning of an [[election campaign]] to form a new one. This phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a [[writ of election]] must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the [[High Sheriff]]s of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections.

==United States law==
Early [[law of the United States]] inherited the traditional English writ system, in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law [[court]]s were authorized to grant. The [[All Writs Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizes [[United States federal courts]] to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." However, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], adopted in 1938 to govern [[civil procedure]] in the [[United States district court]]s, provide that there is only one [[form of action]] in civil cases, and explicitly abolish certain writs by name. Relief formerly available by a writ is now normally available by a [[lawsuit]] (civil action) or a [[motion (legal)|motion]] in a pending civil action. Nonetheless, a few writs have escaped abolition and remain in current use in the U.S. federal courts:

*The writ of [[habeas corpus]], usually used to test the legality of a prisoner's detention, has expressly been preserved. It is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution (Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the United States federal courts, the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by [[State court (United States)|state courts]]. The writ's application does not stop there: the Supreme Court has held the writ of habeas corpus open to all individuals held by the federal government, including Guantanamo Bay detainees. See [[Boumediene v. Bush]]. 
*By statute, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] uses the writ of [[certiorari]] to review cases from the United States courts of appeals or from the state courts.
*In extraordinary circumstances, the [[United States court of appeals]] can use the [[common law]] writ of [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] under the All Writs Act to control proceedings in the district courts.
*Some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case, a United States district court may use the common law writ of [[error coram nobis]] under the All Writs Act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available.
*The United States district courts normally follow state- in the United States federal courts but are almost never used in practice. In modern times, the All Writs Act is most commonly used as authority for federal courts to issue [[injunction]]s to protect their jurisdiction or effectuate their judgments.

The situation in the courts of the various [[U.S. state]]s varies from state to state but is often similar to that in the federal courts. Some states continue to use writ procedures, such as [[quo warranto]], that have been abolished as a procedural matter in federal courts.

In an attempt to purge [[Latin]] from the language of the law, [[California law]] has for many years used the term ''writ of mandate'' in place of ''writ of mandamus'', and ''writ of review'' in place of ''writ of certiorari''.

===Prerogative writs===
{{main article|Prerogative writ}}

The "prerogative" writs are a subset of the class of writs, those that are to be heard ahead of any other cases on a court's docket except other such writs. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''.

The due process for ''petitions for'' such writs is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of nonauthority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. In this they differ from a motion in a civil process in which the burden of proof is on the movant, and in which there can be a question of [[standing (law)|standing]].

===Other writs===
* A [[Attachment (law)|''writ of attachment'']] permits the arrest of a person or the seizure of private property.
* A [[Audita querela|''writ of audita querela'']] inhibits the unconscionable use of a lawful judgment because of matters arising subsequent to the judgment.
* A [[Capias|''writ of capias'']] directs an officer to take into custody the person named in the writ or order.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary of Terms", ''Shelby County Criminal Court Clerk'', s.v. "capias", retrieved on 30 Jun 2009: [http://www.co.shelby.tn.us/court_clerks/criminal_court/glossary.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[coram nobis|''writ of coram nobis'']] corrects a previous error "of the most fundamental character" to "achieve justice" where "no other remedy" is available, e.g., when a judgment was rendered without full knowledge of the facts.
* A [[elegit|''writ of elegit'']] orders the seizure of a portion of a debtor's lands and all his goods (except work animals) towards satisfying a creditor, until the debt is paid off.
* A ''writ of error'' is issued by an [[appeal|appellate court]], and directs a lower court of record to submit its record of the case laid for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;"Writ and Petition History System in Texas" [https://books.google.com/books?id=qB7k56Ufw_sC&amp;pg=PA90 page 90] ''In'' Quarles, Brandon D. and Cordon, Matthew C. (2003) ''Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner''&amp;nbsp; W.S. Hein, Buffalo, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-8377-3626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''writ of exigent'' (or ''exigend'') commands a sheriff to summon a defendant indicted for a felony, who had failed to appear in court, to deliver himself up upon pain of outlawry or forfeiture of his goods.
* A [[fieri facias|''writ of fieri facias'']] (colloquially "fi fa") commands a sheriff to take and auction off enough property from a losing party to pay the debt (plus interest and costs) owed by a judgment debtor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armstronglawyers.com.au/index.php?sectionID=6588&amp;pageID=6600 "Legal Terms", ''Armstrong Lawyers'', retrieved on 11 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[mittimus|''writ of mittimus'']] orders either (1) a court to send its record to another or (2) a jailor to receive the accused in his or her custody at any point during the investigative or trial process.
* A [[Ne exeat|''writ of ne exeat'']] restrains a defendant from fleeing the country or jurisdiction.
* A [[praemunire|''writ of praemunire'']] instructs a sheriff to order someone to appear in court to answer for any of a number of different crimes.
* A [[Scire facias|''writ of scire facias'']] revives a dormant judgment.
* A ''writ of supersedeas'' contains a command to stay the proceedings at law.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary of Terms", ''Colorado State Courts'', retrieved on 19 June 2009: [http://www.courts.state.co.us/Glossary.cfm].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Venire facias de novo|''writ of venire facias'']] summons jurors to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;"Gloss...Terms", ''Shelby'' (op. cit.), s.v. "Venire facias".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian law ==
Under the [[India]]n legal system, jurisdiction to issue '[[prerogative writ]]s' is given to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], and to the High Courts of Judicature of all [[States of India|Indian states]]. Parts of the law relating to writs are set forth in the [[Constitution of India]]. The Supreme Court, the highest in the country, may issue writs under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and under Articles 139 for enforcement of rights other than Fundamental Rights, while High Courts, the superior courts of the States, may issue writs under Articles 226. '''&lt;u&gt;The Constitution broadly provides for five kinds of "prerogative" writs: ''habeas corpus'', ''certiorari'', ''mandamus'', ''quo warranto'' and prohibition.&lt;/u&gt;''' 

* The ''[[writ of prohibition]]'' is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court. Thus, the higher court transfers the case to itself.
* The ''[[writ of habeas corpus]]'' is issued to a detaining authority, ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court, along with the cause of his or her detention. If the detention is found to be illegal, the court issues an order to set the person free.
* The ''[[writ of certiorari]]'' is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review, together with all supporting files, evidence and documents, usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court. It is one of the mechanisms by which the [[Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of India|fundamental rights]] of the citizens are upheld.
* The ''[[writ of mandamus]]'' is issued to a subordinate court, an officer of government, or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties.
* The ''[[writ of quo warranto]]'' is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office. Through this writ the court inquires 'by what authority' the person supports his or her claim.

The '''Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center'''&lt;ref&gt;"Yongbyon" is spelled and pronounced 녕변 (Nyŏngbyŏn) in North Korea and 영변 (Yŏngbyŏn) in South Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; is [[North Korea]]'s major nuclear facility, operating its first [[nuclear reactor]]s. It is located in [[Nyongbyon County]] in [[North Pyongan Province]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Pyongyang]]. The center produced the [[fissile material]] for North Korea's [[List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea|six nuclear weapon tests from 2006 to 2017]], and since 2009 is developing indigenous [[light water reactor]] nuclear power station technology. Since early 2018, nuclear testing at Yongbyon has ceased and the site has seen hardly any movement in activity.&lt;ref name=oct31 /&gt;

==Facilities==
The major installations include all aspects of a [[Magnox]] [[nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear reactor fuel cycle]], based on the use of [[natural uranium]] fuel:
* a [[Nuclear fuel|fuel]] fabrication plant,
* a 5&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]] experimental reactor producing power and district heating,
* a short-term [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] storage facility,
* a [[Nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]] facility that recovers [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] from [[spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] using the [[PUREX]] process.

Magnox spent fuel is not designed for long-term storage as both the casing and [[uranium]] metal core react with water; it is designed to be reprocessed within a few years of removal from a reactor.&lt;ref name=RWMAC&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rwmac/reports/reprocess/16.htm |title=RWMAC's Advice to Ministers on the Radioactive Waste Implications of Reprocessing, Annex 4: Dry storage and disposal of Magnox spent fuel |author=Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee |publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] |date=November 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819040238/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rwmac/reports/reprocess/16.htm |archivedate=19 August 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[carbon dioxide]] cooled, [[Nuclear graphite|graphite]] [[Neutron moderator|moderated]] Magnox reactor does not require difficult-to-produce [[enriched uranium]] fuel or a [[heavy water]] moderator it is an attractive choice for a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development.

The Magnox facilities were disabled in 2007 in accord with the [[six-party talks]] agreement, but following the breakdown of that agreement were partially re-enabled in 2009 to reprocess existing stocks of spent fuel.  On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the reactor had resumed operation.&lt;ref name=bbc-20150915&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34254634 |title=North Korea Yongbyon nuclear site 'in operation' |publisher=BBC |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=15 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915114315/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34254634 |archivedate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center also has an IRT-2000 pool-type [[research reactor]], supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1963, operational since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Reactor Details – IRT-DPRK |url=http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/rrdb.page.pl/rrdeta.htm?country=KP&amp;site=IRT-DPRK&amp;facno=258 |date=30 July 1996 |accessdate=14 February 2007 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor fuel is IRT-2M type assemblies of 36% and 80% [[highly enriched uranium]].&lt;ref name=hecker-20080314&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/publications/report_of_visit_to_north_korea_to_senate_foreign_relations_committee/ |title=Report of Visit to North Korea to Senate Foreign Relations Committee |author=Siegfried S.

In 2009 the building of a small indigenous experimental [[light water reactor]] started. In 2010 a [[uranium enrichment]] plant began operating.&lt;ref name=hecker-20101120/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yongbyon 5 MWe reactor - fuel channels access ports.jpg|thumb|left|The 5&amp;nbsp;MWe reactor, showing the fuel channels access ports]]
Construction of the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor began in 1980, and the reactor first went [[Critical mass|critical]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=nyt-19920517/&gt; This reactor was an initial small technology proving reactor for a following development program of larger Magnox reactors. The [[spent nuclear fuel]] reprocessing facility appeared to still be under construction in 1992.&lt;ref name=nyt-19920517&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/world/north-korean-site-has-a-bomb-hints.html |title=North Korean site has A-bomb hints |author=Sheryl WuDunn |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 May 1992 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329145325/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/world/north-korean-site-has-a-bomb-hints.html |archivedate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor operated intermittently until 1994 when it was shut down in accordance with the [[U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework]]. Following the breakdown of the Agreed Framework in 2002, operation restarted in February 2003, creating [[plutonium]] within its fuel load at a rate of about 6&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name=bridge-hecker-2010&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/north_koreas_choice_bombs_over_electricity/ |title=North Korea's Choice: Bombs Over Electricity |author1=Siegfried S.

The [[spent nuclear fuel]] has been reprocessed with an estimated yield of about 24 to 42&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium metal,&lt;ref name=bridge-hecker-2010 /&gt; some of which was used for the [[nuclear weapon]]s involved in the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|2006]] and [[2009 North Korean nuclear test]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT-10061017&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/world/asia/17diplo.html North Korean Fuel Identified as Plutonium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219221406/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/world/asia/17diplo.html |date=19 December 2016 }}, Thom Shanker and David E. Sanger, [[New York Times]], 17 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Yongbyon is also the site of a 50 [[MWe]] Magnox prototype power reactor, but construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the Agreed Framework, and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly.&lt;ref name=bas-hecker-20090512&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-risks-of-north-koreas-nuclear-restart |title=The risks of North Korea's nuclear restart |author=Siegfried S.

Another 200&amp;nbsp;MWe Magnox full-scale power reactor was being constructed at [[Taechon]], 20&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Yongbyon, ({{Coord|39.928|125.569|type:landmark_region:KP|display=inline}}) until construction was also halted in 1994 in accord with the Agreed Framework. By 2005 reconstruction of this reactor was uneconomic.

The reactor designs were based on declassified information about the British [[Magnox]] design at [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] and elsewhere, and the spent fuel reprocessing plant on the multi-national ''European Company for the Chemical Processing of Irradiated Fuels'' (EUROCHEMIC) plant at [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]]-[[Dessel]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name=bridge-hecker-2010 /&gt;

===2007 shutdown===
[[File:Yongbyon, disabled nuclear fuel fabrication facility machine shop.jpg|thumb|Empty machine shop in the disabled fuel fabrication facility]]
On 13 February 2007, an agreement was reached at the [[Six-party talks|Six party talks]] that [[North Korea]] will shut down and seal the Magnox nuclear reactor and associated facilities and invite back [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] personnel to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications.&lt;ref name="IAEA-GOV/2007/45-GC(51)/19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC51/GC51Documents/English/gc51-19_en.pdf |title=Application of Safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) |date=17 August 2007 |id=GOV/2007/45-GC(51)/19 |publisher=IAEA |accessdate=9 August 2009 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509080157/http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC51/GC51Documents/English/gc51-19_en.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for this [[North Korea]] will receive emergency energy assistance from the other five parties in the form of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.

[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspectors arrived at the site on 28 June to discuss verification and monitoring arrangements for the shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/06/27/koreas.nuclear.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest U.N. nuke inspectors go to N.

In his Introductory Statement to the IAEA Board of Governors on 2008-03-03, the Director General stated that he could not provide an update on the disabling of the facilities, as it was not undertaken by the IAEA.  All fuel rods from the 5 MWe Experimental Nuclear Power Plant and nuclear material generated by the disabling of the Nuclear Fuel Fabrication Plant were under IAEA containment and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2008/ebsp2008n003.html#dprk Verification of Nuclear Non-Proliferation: Implementation of Safeguards in the DPRK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155019/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2008/ebsp2008n003.html |date=9 May 2008 }}", IAEA: Statements of the Director General, Vienna, 2008-03-03.

===2008 cooling tower demolition===
On Friday 27 June 2008, North Korea destroyed the most visible symbol of its nuclear weapons program – the [[cooling tower]] at its main atomic reactor in the complex.  The implosion was witnessed by a number of international journalists and diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23933319-2703,00.html|title=Blast gets North Korea off US blacklist|date=28 June 2008|work=The Australian|accessdate=10 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demolition of the {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall cooling tower, which carried off waste heat to the atmosphere, is a response to U.S. concessions after the North delivered a declaration of its nuclear programs to be dismantled. The United States paid the US$2.5 million demolition fee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Possible reactivation===
During 2008 tensions resurfaced between North Korea and the U.S. due to disagreements over the [[six-party talks]] disarmament process. On 8 October 2008, [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] inspectors were forbidden by the North Korean government to conduct further inspections of the site. However two days later the U.S. removed North Korea from the U.S. [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list and the Yongbyon deactivation process resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90e15f8c-970d-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |title=Bush removes North Korea from terror list |author=Demetri Sevastopulo |date=10 October 2008 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012123110/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90e15f8c-970d-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |archivedate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 resumption of reprocessing===
According to the state-run North Korean news agency KCNA website, the DPRK resumed the reprocessing of spent fuel to recover plutonium on 25 April 2009 in response to the UN's condemnation of its recent [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2|rocket launch]]. This material supplemented that used for nuclear weapons testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = North Korea says it has started reprocessing spent fuel rods  | place = Nexis   | publisher = BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific – Political | date = 25 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light water reactor development===
In 2009 North Korea announced its intention to build an indigenous experimental [[light water reactor]] (LWR) and the uranium enrichment technology to provide its nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=kcna-20090613&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200906/news13/20090613-10ee.html |title=DPRK Foreign Ministry Declares Strong Counter- Measures against UNSC's "Resolution 1874" |date=13 June 2010 |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency]] |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609220635/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200906/news13/20090613-10ee.html |archivedate=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a 2,000 [[gas centrifuge]] uranium enrichment plant to produce [[low enriched uranium]] (LEU) fuel began operating, and construction started on the experimental 25 to 30 MWe LWR, with a target operation date for the reactor of 2012.&lt;ref name=hecker-20101120&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/north_koreas_yongbyon_nuclear_complex_a_report_by_siegfried_s_hecker/ |title=A Return Trip to North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Complex |author=Siegfried S.

===Suspension of uranium enrichment===
In February 2012, North Korea announced that it would suspend uranium enrichment at Yongbyon, and not conduct any further tests of nuclear weapons while productive negotiations involving the United States continue. Additionally, North Korea would allow IAEA inspectors to monitor operations at Yongbyon. The U.S. reaffirmed that it does not have hostile intent toward the DPRK, and is prepared to improve bilateral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201202/news29/20120229-37ee.html |title=DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Result of DPRK-U.S. Talks |publisher=Korean Central News Agency |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304080511/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201202/news29/20120229-37ee.html |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184869.htm |title=U.S.-DPRK Bilateral Discussions |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302195255/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184869.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear enrichment was presumably resumed following the collapse of the Leap Day Deal.

===2013 planned restart of operation===
In March 2013, North Korea announced that they would be restarting operation of the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor.&lt;ref name=bbc-20130402&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21999193 |title=North Korea 'to restart Yongbyon nuclear reactor' |publisher=BBC |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407063220/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21999193 |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so, the disabled secondary cooling system will have to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://38north.org/2013/04/yongbyon040313/ |title=Satellite Images Show New Construction at North Korea’s Plutonium Production Reactor; Rapid Restart? |author1=Nick Hansen |author2=Jeffrey Lewis |lastauthoramp=yes |date=3 April 2013 |work=38 North, [[School of Advanced International Studies]] |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407180539/http://38north.org/2013/04/yongbyon040313/ |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the Yongbyon nuclear site is in full operation, including the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor.&lt;ref name=bbc-20150915/&gt; However, satellite imagery in April 2016 suggested it was not operating at a high power level.&lt;ref name=38north-20160415&gt;{{cite news|url=http://38north.org/2016/04/yongbyon041516/ |title=More Evidence of Possible Reprocessing Campaign at Yongbyon; Progress at Experimental Light Water Reactor |author=Joseph S.

Infra-red imagery analysis covering from September 2016 to June 2017 showed that the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor had either not been operated, or operated at a low-level. The Radiochemical Laboratory had operated intermittently.&lt;ref name=38north-20170714&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.38north.org/2017/07/yongbyon071417/ |title=North Korea's Yongbyon Facility: Probable Production of Additional Plutonium for Nuclear Weapons |author=Joseph S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44555">'''Zinc-finger nucleases''' ('''ZFNs''') are artificial [[restriction enzymes]] generated by fusing a [[zinc finger]] [[DNA-binding domain]] to a [[nuclease|DNA-cleavage domain]].   Zinc finger domains can be engineered to target specific desired [[DNA]] sequences and this enables zinc-finger nucleases to target unique sequences within complex [[genome]]s.  By taking advantage of endogenous DNA repair machinery, these reagents can be used to precisely alter the genomes of higher organisms. Alongside [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] and [[TALEN]], ZFN is a prominent tool in the field of [[genome editing]].

The DNA-binding domains of individual ZFNs typically contain between three and six individual [[zinc finger]] repeats and can each recognize between 9 and 18 basepairs.  If the zinc finger domains perfectly recognize a 3 basepair DNA sequence to generate a 3-finger array that can recognize a 9 basepair target site.  Other procedures can utilize either 1-finger or 2-finger modules to generate zinc-finger arrays with six or more individual zinc fingers.  The main drawback with this procedure is the specificities of individual zinc fingers can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA.  Without methods to account for this "context dependence", the standard modular assembly procedure often fails unless it is used to recognize sequences of the form (GNN)&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ramirez CL |title=Unexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fingers |journal=Nat.

Numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc-finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences.  Initial selection efforts utilized [[phage display]] to select proteins that bound a given DNA target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc-finger arrays.  More recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells.  A promising new method to select novel zinc-finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed "OPEN" by its creators.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence.  This system was developed by the Zinc-Finger Consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc-finger arrays.

=== DNA-cleavage domain ===
[[File:Repair outcomes of a genomic double-strand break for ZFN cleavage.jpg|thumb|A pair of ZFNs, each with three zinc fingers binding to target DNA, are shown introducing a double-strand break, at the FokI domain, depicted in yellow. Subsequently, the double strand break is shown as being repaired through either [[homology-directed repair]] or [[non-homologous end joining]].&lt;ref name="genomeengineering"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=D|year=2011|title=Genome engineering with zinc-finger nucleases|url=|journal=Genetics Society of America|volume=188|issue=4|pages=773–782|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.131433|pmc=3176093|pmid=21828278}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The non-specific cleavage domain from the type IIs [[restriction endonuclease]] [[FokI]] is typically used as the cleavage domain in ZFNs.&lt;ref name="kim1996"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kim| first=YG|author2=Cha, J. |author3=Chandrasegaran, S. | year=1996| title=Hybrid restriction enzymes: zinc finger fusions to Fok I cleavage domain| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| volume= 93| issue=3| pages=1156–60 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/3/1156.abstract| doi=10.1073/pnas.93.3.1156| pmid=8577732| pmc=40048|bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.1156K }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
This cleavage domain must dimerize in order to cleave DNA&lt;ref name="bitinaite1998"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bitinaite| first=J.| author2= D. A. Wah, Aggarwal, A. K., Schildkraut, I.| year=1998| title=FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| volume= 95| issue=18| pages=10570–5 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/18/10570| doi=10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570| pmid=9724744| pmc=27935|bibcode = 1998PNAS...9510570B }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and thus a pair of ZFNs are required to target non-palindromic DNA sites. Standard ZFNs fuse the cleavage domain to the C-terminus of each zinc finger domain. To let the two cleavage domains dimerize and cleave DNA, the two individual ZFNs must bind opposite strands of DNA with their C-termini a certain distance apart.  The most commonly used linker sequences between the zinc finger domain and the cleavage domain requires the 5' edge of each binding site to be separated by 5 to 7 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cathomen T, Joung JK |title=Zinc-finger nucleases: the next generation emerges |journal=Mol. Ther. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=1200–7 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18545224 |doi=10.1038/mt.2008.114 |url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v16/n7/abs/mt2008114a.html}}

Several different [[protein engineering]] techniques have been employed to improve both the activity and specificity of the nuclease domain used in ZFNs.  [[Directed evolution]] has been employed to generate a FokI variant with enhanced cleavage activity that the authors dubbed "Sharkey".&lt;ref name=Guo2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.04.060 | last1 = Guo | first1 = J. | last2 = Gaj | first2 = T. | last3 = Barbas Iii | first3 = C.

=== Disabling an allele ===
ZFNs can be used to disable dominant mutations in heterozygous individuals by producing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA (see [[Genetic recombination]]) in the mutant allele, which will, in the absence of a homologous template, be repaired by [[non-homologous end-joining]] (NHEJ). NHEJ repairs DSBs by joining the two ends together and usually produces no mutations, provided that the cut is clean and uncomplicated. In some instances, however, the repair is imperfect, resulting in deletion or insertion of base-pairs, producing [[frame-shift]] and preventing the production of the harmful protein.&lt;ref name="durai"/&gt; Multiple pairs of ZFNs can also be used to completely remove entire large segments of genomic sequence.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To monitor the editing activity, a PCR of the target area amplifies both alleles and, if one contains an insertion, deletion, or mutation, it results in a heteroduplex single-strand bubble that cleavage assays can easily detect.
ZFNs have also been used to modify disease-causing alleles in triplet repeat disorders. Expanded CAG/CTG repeat tracts are the genetic basis for more than a dozen inherited neurological disorders including Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been demonstrated in human cells that ZFNs can direct double-strand breaks (DSBs) to CAG repeats and shrink the repeat from long pathological lengths to short, less toxic lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mittelman|first=D|author2=Moye, C |author3=Morton, J |author4=Sykoudis, K |author5=Lin, Y |author6=Carroll, D |author7=Wilson, JH |title=Zinc-finger directed double-strand breaks within CAG repeat tracts promote repeat instability in human cells|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2009-06-16|volume=106|issue=24|pages=9607–12|pmid=19482946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902420106|pmc=2701052|bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.9607M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a group of researchers have successfully applied the ZFN technology to genetically modify the gol pigment gene and the ntl gene in zebrafish embryo. Specific zinc-finger motifs were engineered to recognize distinct DNA sequences.  The ZFN-encoding mRNA was injected into one-cell embryos and a high percentage of animals carried the desired mutations and phenotypes. Their research work demonstrated that ZFNs can specifically and efficiently create heritable mutant alleles at loci of interest in the germ line, and ZFN-induced alleles can be propagated in subsequent generations.

Similar research of using ZFNs to create specific mutations in zebrafish embryo has also been carried out by other research groups. The kdr gene in zebra fish encodes for the vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptor. Mutagenic lesions at this target site was induced using ZFN technique by a group of researchers in US. They suggested that the ZFN technique allows straightforward generation of a targeted allelic series of mutants; it does not rely on the existence of species-specific embryonic stem cell lines and is applicable to other vertebrates, especially those whose embryos are easily available; finally, it is also feasible to achieve targeted knock-ins in zebrafish, therefore it is possible to create human disease models that are heretofore inaccessible.

=== Allele editing ===
ZFNs are also used to rewrite the sequence of an allele by invoking the [[homologous recombination]] (HR) machinery to repair the DSB using the supplied DNA fragment as a template. The HR machinery searches for homology between the damaged chromosome and the extra-chromosomal fragment and copies the sequence of the fragment between the two broken ends of the chromosome, regardless of whether the fragment contains the original sequence. If the subject is homozygous for the target allele, the efficiency of the technique is reduced since the undamaged copy of the allele may be used as a template for repair instead of the supplied fragment.

===Gene therapy===
The success of gene therapy depends on the efficient insertion of therapeutic [[gene]]s at the appropriate [[chromosome|chromosomal]] target sites within the human [[genome]], without causing cell injury, [[oncogenesis|oncogenic]] mutations or an [[immune response]]. The construction of [[plasmid]] [[Plasmid#Vectors|vector]]s is simple and straightforward. Custom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of ''Fok''I endonuclease with zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site-specific DSB to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoding plasmids could be used to transiently express ZFNs to target a DSB to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the therapeutic genes to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoding plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent all the problems associated with the viral delivery of therapeutic genes.&lt;ref name= Kandavelou&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kandavelou K, Chandrasegaran  S |year=2008|chapter=Plasmids for Gene Therapy|title=Plasmids: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first therapeutic applications of ZFNs are likely to involve ''ex vivo'' therapy using a patients own stem cells. After editing the stem cell genome, the cells could be expanded in culture and reinserted into the patient to produce differentiated cells with corrected functions. Initial targets likely include the causes of monogenic diseases, such as the IL2Rγ gene and the b-globin gene for gene correction and CCR5 gene for mutagenesis and disablement.&lt;ref name="durai"/&gt;

== Potential problems ==
=== Off-target cleavage ===

If the zinc finger domains are not specific enough for their target site or they do not target a unique site within the genome of interest, off-target cleavage may occur.  Such off-target cleavage may lead to the production of enough double-strand breaks to overwhelm the repair machinery and, as a consequence, yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death.  Off-target cleavage events may also promote random integration of donor DNA.&lt;ref name="durai"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Durai S, Mani M, Kandavelou K, Wu J, Porteus MH, Chandrasegaran S |title=Zinc finger nucleases: custom-designed molecular scissors for genome engineering of plant and mammalian cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=18 |pages=5978–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16251401 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki912 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16251401 |pmc=1270952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two separate methods have been demonstrated to decrease off-target cleavage for 3-finger ZFNs that target two adjacent 9-basepair sites.&lt;ref&gt;

Other groups use ZFNs with 4, 5 or 6 zinc fingers that target longer and presumably rarer sites and such ZFNs could theoretically yield less off-target activity.  A comparison of a pair of 3-finger ZFNs and a pair of 4-finger ZFNs detected off-target cleavage in human cells at 31 loci for the 3-finger ZFNs and at 9 loci for the 4-finger ZFNs.&lt;ref name=Pattanayak2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanayak | first1 = V. | last2 = Ramirez | first2 = C.

=== Immunogenicity ===
{{details|Adaptive immune response}}

As with many foreign proteins inserted into the human body, there is a risk of an immunological response against the therapeutic agent and the cells in which it is active. Since the protein must be expressed only transiently, however, the time over which a response may develop is short.&lt;ref name="durai"/&gt;

== Prospects ==
The ability to precisely manipulate the genomes of plants, animals and insects has numerous applications in basic research, agriculture, and human therapeutics. Using ZFNs to modify endogenous genes has traditionally been a difficult task due mainly to the challenge of generating zinc finger domains that target the desired sequence with sufficient specificity. Improved methods of engineering zinc finger domains and the availability of ZFNs from a commercial supplier now put this technology in the hands of increasing numbers of researchers.  Several groups are also developing other types of engineered nucleases including engineered homing endonucleases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grizot S |title=Efficient targeting of a SCID gene by an engineered single-chain homing endonuclease |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=37 |issue=16 |pages=5405–19 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19584299 |pmc=2760784 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkp548 |url=|name-list-format=vanc|author2= Smith J |author3= Daboussi F |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zinc-finger nickases ==

This reduction provides a bias for HR-mediated gene modifications. ZFNickases can induce targeted HR in cultured human and livestock cells, although at lower levels than corresponding ZFNs from which they were derived because nicks can be repaired without genetic alteration.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Wang | first1 = J. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = G. | last3 = Doyon | first3 = Y. | last4 = Wang | first4 = N.

Regardless of the presence of a DNA donor construct, both repair mechanisms can be activated following DSBs induced by ZFNs. Thus, ZFNickases is the first plausible attempt at engineering a method to favor the HR method of DNA repair as opposed to the error-prone NHEJ repair. By reducing NHEJ repairs, ZFNickases can thereby reduce the spectrum of unwanted off-target alterations. The ease by which ZFNickases can be derive from ZFNs provides a great platform for further studies regarding the optimization of ZFNickases and possibly increasing their levels of targeted HR while still maintain their reduced NHEJ frequency.
