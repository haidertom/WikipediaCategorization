'''Aging''' is a process by which an [[Work of art|art]]work, typically a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]], is made to appear old. It is meant to emulate the natural deterioration that can occur over many decades or centuries.

Paintings deteriorate over time because they are created using essentially incompatible materials, with each having a different reaction to the changes in the environment, including light, temperature and [[relative humidity]].

An oil painting consists of several layers, comprising the base [[canvas]], a layer of [[gesso]] base coat, several layers of the [[oil paint|oil-based paint]] and then several coats of [[varnish]] to protect the paint surface. With many different materials, it is understandable that each layer may dry at different rates and will also absorb and release moisture at different rates. When this occurs, expansion and contraction of the painting will result in a crazing of the varnish surface. This pattern of small cracks is known as [[craquelure]]. Along with the darkening or yellowing of the varnish surface, it is this visual representation of the cracking that is typically the primary indicator of ageing.

The purpose for artificially ageing is to create a finished product that accurately reflects an era or is consistent with the environment (usually period) into which it is to be placed.

'''Alikhan Nurmukhameduly Bukeikhanov''' ({{lang-kz|Álihan Nurmuhameduly Bókeıhanov}}; {{lang-ru|Алихан Нурмухамедович Букейханов}}; March 5, 1866 – September 27, 1937) was a [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] statesman, politician, publicist, teacher, writer and environmental scientist who served as the Prime Minister of the [[Alash Autonomy]] from 1917 to 1920. He was leader and founder of the [[Alash Orda]] national liberation movement.

==Early life==
Alikhan Bukeikhanov was born March 5, 1866, in Tokyrauyn Volost, [[Karkaraly|Karkaralinsky Uyezd]], [[Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russia|Semipalatinsk Oblast]], [[Russian Empire]]. He was a great grandson of [[Barak Sultan]], former khan of [[Bukey Horde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sultan-Khan Akkuly|title=Childhood and boyhood of the future leader of the nation: Alikhan was born different|url=http://e-history.kz/media/upload/2065/2014/10/27/b9b0e05f4555f26ba7b09cfb1949d4c8.pdf|date=December 2014|accessdate=January 31, 2015|publisher=e-history.kz|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the Russian-Kazakh School and Omsk Technical School in 1890. He later studied at the Saint Petersburg Forestry Institute, where he graduated from the Faculty of Economics in 1894. During his youth, he is believed to have been influenced by [[Socialism|socialists]].

Upon graduating, Bukeikhanov returned to [[Omsk]] and spent the next fourteen years there working. From 1895 to 1897, he worked as teacher of mathematic in Omsk school for Kazakh children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Alikhan Bokeikhan: prison epopee|author=Sultan-Khan Akkuly|url=http://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/776|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a participant in the 1896 Shcherbina Expedition, which aimed to research and assess virtually every aspect of Russian-controlled [[Central Asia]] from the [[Natural environment|environment]] and resources to the culture and traditions of its inhabitants. This was the first of a few similar missions which Bukeikhanov accepted. Among his recorded contributions is "Ovtsevodstvo v stepnom krae" ("Sheep-Breeding in the Steppe Land"), which analyzed animal husbandry in Central Asia. Bukeikhanov was the first biographer of [[Abay Kunanbayev]], publishing an obituary in ''Semipalatinsky listok'' in 1905. In 1909, he published collection of Kunanbayev's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Aigul Bidanova|title=Ethnic Costumes in 1902 Exhibition Came From Abai|url=http://www.astanatimes.com/2013/08/ethnic-costumes-in-1902-exhibition-came-from-abai/|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2015|publisher=''The Astana Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
In 1905, Bukeikhanov's political activism began when he joined the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]].{{cn|date=July 2015}} In late 1905 at the Uralsk oblast party congress, he tried to create the Kazakh Democratic party but failed. As a result of this action, he was arrested and prohibited from living in the Steppe Oblasts. During his exile, he relocated to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]. He was elected to the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma of the Russian Empire]] as a member of that party in 1906, and signed the Vyborg petition to protest the dissolution of the Duma by [[tsar]]. In 1908, he was arrested again and was exiled in Samara until 1917. While in Samara, he participated in the Samara Guberniya Committee of the People's Freedom party set up in 1915.

[[File:Alash intelligentsia, Semipalatinsk, 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Bukeikhanov among Alash intelligentsia in [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] in 1918.]]
In April 1917, Bukeikhanov, [[Akhmet Baitursynov]] and several other native political figures took the initiative to convening an All-Kazakh Congress in [[Orenburg]].{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 84}} In its resolution the Congress urged the return to the native population of all the lands confiscated from it by the previous regime, and the explusion of all the new settlers from the Kazakh-Kirghiz territories. Other resolutions demanded the transfer of the local schools into native hands, and the termination of the recruitment introduced in 1916. Within the group, Bukeikhanov sought to direct attention first to economic problems along with Russian liberals, chiefly the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], whereas others sought to unite the Kazakhs with the other Turkic peoples of Russia.{{Sfn | Pierce | 1960 | p = 260}} Three month later another Kazakh-Kirghiz Congress met in Orenburg. There for the first time the idea of territorial autonomy emerged, and a national Kazakh-Kirghiz political party was formed [[Alash Autonomy]].{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}} Before the [[February Revolution]], he collaborated with the Kadets in the hope of getting autonomous status for Kazakhs and contacted the head of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Kerensky proceeded to make Bukeikhanov a comissar. On March 19, 1917, he was appointed as the Provisional Government Commissioner of [[Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire)|Turgay Oblast]]. After the [[October Revolution]], he was elected in 1917 as president of the [[Alash Orda]] government of [[Alash Autonomy]].

In 1920, after the establishment of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hegemony, Bukeikhanov joined the [[Bolshevik]] party and returned to scientific life. His earlier political activities caused the authorities to view him with suspicion, leading to arrests in 1926 and 1928. In 1926, Bukeikhanov was arrested on the charge of counter-revolutionary activity and put into [[Butyrka prison]] in Moscow. But due to the lack of evidence in the criminal case against him, he was released from prison. In 1930, the authorities banished him to [[Moscow]], where he was arrested a final time in 1937 and executed.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

It was not until 1989 that the Soviet authorities rehabilitated him.

==Writings==
Bukeikhanov's major political publication was "Kirgizy" ("The Kazakhs") (1910), which was released in the Constitutional Democratic party book on nationalities edited by A. I. Kosteliansky. Bukeikhanov's other activities of this period include assisting in the creation of ''[[Qazaq (journal)|Qazaq]]'', a [[Kazakh language]] newspaper and writing newspaper articles for newspapers including "Dala Walayatynyng Gazeti" (Omsk), "Orenburgskii Listok", "Semipalatinskii Listok", "Turkestanskie Vedomosti" ([[Tashkent]]), "Stepnoi Pioner" (Omsk) and "Sary-Arqa" ([[Semey|Semipalatinsk]]). He was also a contributor to ''[[Ay Qap]]'' and "Sibirskie Voprosy".

In 1892 [[August Weismann]] proposed in his [[germ plasm]] theory that heritable information is transmitted only via [[germ cell]]s, which he thought contained determinants (genes). [[Francis Galton]], supposing that undesirable traits such as [[club foot]] and [[criminality]] were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Paul Broca]] attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as [[H. H. Goddard]], and [[Robert Yerkes]] attempted to [[Intelligence Quotient|measure people's intelligence]] and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.

Galton popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]], later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behavior. Scientists such as ecologists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=2016 |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908|pmid=26917750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioural geneticists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |year=2003 |title=The Dependent Gene: The Fallacy of Nature Vs. Nurture |publisher=Henry Holt |isbn=978-0805072808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 20th century, the [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|determinism of gender roles]] was debated by geneticists and others. Biologists such as [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] attempted to describe [[femininity]] and [[homosexuality]] according to then-current social standards; against this, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and others argued that clothing and other preferences vary in different societies. The biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] founded the discipline of sociobiology, founded on observations of animals such as [[social insects]], controversially suggesting that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.

==History==

=== Roots ===
Biological determinism is the belief that a human’s behavior is controlled by an person’s genes and inherited traits. It dates back to the 1800s. Stephen Jay Gould has spent his career tracing the roots of this “western” thought because it is more involved than anyone could have assumed. Gould suggests that the main theories of biological determinism are based on bad biology and bad use of the scientific method. When a scientist says they used the scientific method to gather their data, the readers automatically assume that the information given must be correct. 
	
Gould presents three key ideas that have influenced biological determinism. The first is that measurement and quantification have changed science over the past century and without context, these measurements are useless. If something is assigned a number, then it must be real, true, and scientific. If these numbers and measurements are given without context, then the data can be given many different meanings. The second is that reinfication, the idea that certain qualities (intelligence, race) are valid because we put a name on it. One could separate a group into different components and give a name to these divided groups and have it be true, but actually, there is nothing scientific about intelligence being used as a unitary quality. The third problem is that the main thought behind biological determinism is that traits are inherited. Scientists have traced certain traits through families lines and found that some are inherited. Gould suggests that these studies merely restate the original assumption. Gould points out that various theories of biological determinism have no evidence or science to back them up, and even though these ideas are very flawed, people still widely accept them. 
	
However, Gould is thought to be flawed in his own way because readers believe he is simply disregarding certain aspects of science. Gould questions that since the scientific aspects of the works themselves are so flawed that why is it so widespread accepted. Gould suggests that there could be some social, political, and economic forces which could explain why these biological determinism theories are so widely accepted, but he fails to go further deep into the topic. Gould shows that these biological determinism theories have many consequences for human life and scientists in the future can see these and use his book to continue trying to show the people that biological determinism, is in fact, false. 
	
In this review of Gould’s essay by Garland E. Allen, Allen writes that Gould has helped future scientists examine social, economic, and political values of this time regarding biological determinism. Biological determinism is still prominent in scientific works, past and present, that have been regarded by the public as true and believable. Gould wants his readers to understand that biological determinism has roots all throughout science, even though it has been proven false. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Garland E.|date=1984|editor-last=Gould|editor-first=Stephen Jay|title=The Roots of Biological Determinism|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=141–145|jstor=4330882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germ plasm===
{{main|Germ plasm}}
In 1892, the Austrian biologist [[August Weismann]] proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: [[somatic cell]]s, which carry out the body's ordinary functions, and [[germ cell]]s, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as [[DNA]], the [[germ plasm]], and individual components of it, now called [[gene]]s, determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |authorlink=August Weismann |year=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A Theory of Inheritance |language=German |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/germ-plasm/facsimile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism's life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that [[Lamarckism|Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics)]] was a possible mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian| authorlink=Julian Huxley |year=1942 |title=Evolution, the modern synthesis |publisher=Allen and Unwin |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, J. Scott |editor1=Henning, Brian G.|editor2=Scarfe, Adam Christian |title=Biology's Second Law: Homeostasis, Purpose, and Desire |work=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naQm1_Lutq4C&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7391-7436-4 |page=192 |quote=Where Weismann would say that it is impossible for changes acquired during an organism's lifetime to feed back onto transmissible traits in the germ line, the CDMB now added that it was impossible for information encoded in proteins to feed back and affect genetic information in any form whatsoever, which was essentially a molecular recasting of the Weismann barrier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|The early eugenicist [[Francis Galton]] invented the term [[eugenics]] and popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Eugenics}}

Early ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as [[club foot]] or [[cleft palate]], or psychological such as [[alcoholism]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[criminality]]. The belief that such traits were inherited led to the desire to solve the problem with the [[eugenics]] movement, led by a follower of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), by forcibly reducing breeding by supposedly defective people. By the 1920s, many U.S. states brought in laws permitting the compulsory [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of [[prison]]s and [[psychiatric hospital]]s. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Garland Edward |title=Biological determinism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mismeasure&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=The Mismeasure of Man |date=1981 |publisher=W.

===Scientific racism===
{{main|Scientific racism}}

Under the influence of determinist beliefs, the American [[craniologist]] [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify [[slavery]], and to oppose [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Heritability of IQ===
{{main|Heritability of IQ}}[[Alfred Binet]] (1857–1911)  designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability.  From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as [[H. H. Goddard]] (1866–1957), [[Lewis Terman]] (1877–1956), and [[Robert Yerkes]] (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability.  They attempted to measure people's intelligence with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ tests]], to demonstrate that the resulting scores were [[heritable]], and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest.  It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to America.&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

Lynda Birke argues in her 1992 book ''In Pursuit of Difference'' that biology explains sexual differences by the mechanisms of chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;''In Pursuit of Difference'' by Lynda Birke, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, hormonal differences are not absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people can be born with intersex characteristics, for example as a genetic mosaic.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;[http://www.isna.org Intersex Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality]] can be attributed to both [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological and social causes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Nature/Sexual Culture|year=1995|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226001821|page=4|edition=1|editor=[[Paul R.

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]]'s book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' discussed a study of girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]". The biologists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fitted their own social standards, such as clothing preference or using makeup. The experiment, in Lewontin's words, "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves." Gender differences in work are becoming less pronounced, suggesting that these are imposed by society.&lt;ref name=LewontinRoseKamin1984&gt;[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]], Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin.

==Nature versus nurture debate==
{{main|Nature and nurture}}

The belief in biological determinism has been matched by a [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] denial of any possible influence of genes on human behavior, leading to [[Nature and nurture|a long and heated debate about "nature and nurture"]]. By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes were expressed within an environment, in particular that of [[prenatal development]], and that genes were continuously controlled by the environment through mechanisms such as [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Matt Ridley |author=Ridley, M. |date=2003 |title=Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-002-00663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199-92234-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gutiérrez, Luci |date=January 24, 2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-retire-the-simplicity-of-nature-vs-nurture-1390610295 |title=Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture |newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Gold''''' is a 2006 documentary film that follows the efforts of an Ethiopian coffee-union manager as he travels the world to obtain a better price for his workers' [[coffee bean]]s. The film was directed and produced by Marc James Francis and Nick Francis from [[Speakit Films]], and co-produced by Christopher Hird. It premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |archivedate=22 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film focuses on the coffee growers of the [[Oromia Region]] of southern and western [[Ethiopia]], the birthplace of coffee. It follows [[Tadesse Meskela]], the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]], as he visits coffee-growing regions in [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] and Oromia (including the Kilenso Mokonisa Cooperative in the [[Bule Hora]] [[woreda]] in the [[Borena Zone]] of the Oromia Region), as well as a coffee processing center, a coffee auction house, and his union's headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. He also travels to England and the United States in an effort to promote Ethiopian coffee by eliminating the numerous middlemen. There is also a scene where coffee farmers pray to God for a higher price, which was filmed at the Negele Gorbitu Cooperative, located near [[Irgachefe]] in the [[Gelana Abaya|Abaya]] woreda of the Borena Zone. The Ethiopian coffee farmers speak about their lives, with one explaining that he is cutting down his coffee plants and planting ''[[khat]]'' (a plant containing [[cathinone]], an [[amphetamine]]-like stimulant) instead, due to the low price he is getting for coffee because of the explosion in the number of coffee farmers across the globe, and the comparatively higher price he can get for ''khat''.

The film also includes footage of the [[New York Board of Trade]], a [[commodity markets|commodity-trading]] floor in New York City, where the "C" international benchmark price of coffee is set each business day based on supply and demand, and explores the effects that these international prices (which by 2006 were at an all-time low) have on Ethiopian coffee growers. Other footage was shot at the first [[Starbucks]] and the [[World Barista Championship]] at the 2005 [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] conference in Seattle; and at a café and the [[Illy]] coffee company in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. These scenes stand in stark contrast to the footage of the impoverished conditions faced by the Ethiopian coffee farmers and their families.

==Production==
In July 2003, Nick Francis  and Marc James Francis travelled to Ethiopia and started making the film. The meeting with Tadesse Meskela, the manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union, was a decisive moment in the production of the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Notes|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/production-notes|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiring passion and determination of Tadesse, along with his continuous efforts to improve the lives of the farmers he represents, made Nick Francis and Marc James Francis decide much further in the production process to centre the film narrative around Tadesse's journey, his character functioning as a guide into the coffee world. The Ethiopian footage was filmed on two occasions (in 2003 and 2005), for six weeks each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portafilter.net/2006/11/podcast-56-black-gold-movie.html |title=Podcast 56 - Black Gold The Movie |publisher=portafilter.net |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first shoot in Ethiopia, the crew flew to Cancun to document the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]], where pivotal decisions that affect Africa's economy and development were being made in setting the trade rules and where the struggle for fairer international trade rules was played out. Unprecedented, that year developing countries refused to be forced into signing agreements that were against their interests, and the WTO talks completely collapsed. After the team's return to the UK, they spent the following months developing a rough cut of ''Black Gold''. During these months, the direction of the film took shape, along with the rest of the necessary shoots meant to develop the thrust of the narrative. In 2005, the team returned to Ethiopia for further shoots.

Although [[Starbucks]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], and [[Nestlé]]—the world's largest sellers of coffee—are mentioned in the film, all five companies declined invitations to be interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; By the end of 2005, the final cut of ''Black Gold'' was done and officially premiered during the 2006‘s edition of Sundance Film Festival.

==Music==
[[Andreas Kapsalis]], whom Marc James Francis and Nick Francis met during the Sundance Documentary Composers Lab, wrote the final soundtrack. In doing so, he used in part Mathew Coldrick's Ethiopian instrumental samples, recorded from Ethiopia. Joe Henson, Kunja Chatterton, and Mathew Herbert also contributed to the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soundtrack|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/soundtrack|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
In the first few weeks after the premiere, the film helped to generate donations approximately up to $25,000. The dilapidated school featured in the film was built.

Tadesse Meskela, the main character in ''Black Gold'', was able to increase the market price for his cooperative union's coffee. Tadesse Meskela was invited to 10 Downing Street, where he took his message directly to [[Tony Blair]].

After seeing the film, the UN have invited Tadesse to New York to do a presentation about his co-operatives at the 46th Session of the [[Commission for Social Development]].

''Black Gold'' was screened at the [[World Bank]] and [[European Union]], as part of debates about trade policy and development. The Ethiopian ambassadors based at Berlin, Washington, D.C., and London attended screenings.

''Black Gold'' was the first film to receive funding from BritDoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kopp|first=Ingrid|title=Your Film Can Change the World|url=http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203173950/http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 December 2010|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Chris|title=Black Gold: storm in a coffee cup|url=http://www.screendaily.com/black-gold-storm-in-a-coffee-cup/4033053.article#|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate response to ''Black Gold''==
Since the first showing of ''Black Gold'' during Sundance, Starbucks sent people to screenings of the film in what has been called by one journalist "going on a charm offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carnevale|first=Rob|title=Black Gold - Marc and Nick Francis interview|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/black-gold-marc-and-nick-francis-interview|publisher=indielondon.co.uk|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seager|first=Ashley|title=Starbucks stirred by fair trade film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/29/development.filmnews|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the film became more and more popular, Starbucks flew Tadesse and four other African coffee producers to their Seattle headquarters for a weekend conference, which was seen by many as a PR stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian coffee farmer Tadesse Meskela Gudeta tastes Indonesian coffee Thursday at Starbucks' African Coffee Celebration|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/photo/Ethiopian-coffee-farmer-Tadesse-Meskela-Gudeta-904004.php|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siel|title=Black Gold: A Coffee Film That Has Starbucks Scared|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/black-gold-a-coffee-film-that-has-starbucks-scared.html|publisher=treehugger.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, just before the film premiered at the London Film Festival in October 2006, a memo received by Starbucks staff from the headquarters leaked to the ''Black Gold forum''. The internal memo was sent out to inform all Starbucks employees that ''Black Gold'' was "incomplete and inaccurate".&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;

'''COSI''' (an acronym for '''C'''enter '''o'''f '''S'''cience and '''I'''ndustry) is a [[science museum]] and [[research center]] located in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in the [[United States]]. Originally opened in 1964, COSI was relocated to a 320,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility designed by Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]] along a bend in the [[Scioto River]] in the [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] neighborhood in 1999. COSI features more than 300 interactive exhibits throughout themed exhibition areas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi|title=About COSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a “center of science and industry” (rather than a standalone “science center”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/downloads/about/center-of-science.pdf|title=COSI's Center of Science Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI established embedded partnerships with local organizations. [[WOSU-FM|WOSU]]@COSI (Central Ohio’s [[NPR]] member station and [[Public Broadcasting Service]] public media station) maintains a digital media center and offices; [[Ohio State University|OSU]] maintains a center of research as well as health &amp; medicine laboratories staffed by medical residents; and Columbus Historical Society maintains offices and exhibit space.

COSI also operates the largest outreach education program of any science museum in the United States through COSI in the Classroom, 21st Century Lab field trip experiences, international [[distance education]] Interactive Video Conferencing programs, and COSI On Wheels traveling outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/educators|title=COSI - For Educators}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, COSI originated the Camp-In overnight program for [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] in 1972 – a concept that is now commonplace in museums nationwide. Since 1964, COSI has engaged with nearly 30 million unique visitors through on-site and outreach programs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

As a [[not-for-profit organization]], COSI is supported by ticket sales, a network of community and statewide partnerships (including relationships with a variety of donors and sponsors), a volunteer program supported by 10,000 volunteers annually, and nearly 20,000 member households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/volunteer-employment|title=Volunteer &amp; Employment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, COSI was the named the #1 science center in the United States for families by Parent Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/vacation/us-destinations/best-science-centers/|title=Parents Magazine - 10 Best Science CentersI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
[[Image:AUT 0344.JPG|thumb|The museum's [[Foucault pendulum]], located at the facility's west entrance.]]
''As adopted in 1964...'' "COSI provides an exciting and informative atmosphere for those of all ages to discover more about our environment, our accomplishments, our heritage, and ourselves. We motivate a desire toward a better understanding of science, industry, health, and history through involvement in exhibits, demonstrations, and a variety of educational activities and experiences. COSI is for the enrichment of the individual and for a more rewarding life on our planet, Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi/|title=COSI - Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit areas==
Upon relocating to its new home in 1999, COSI was developed with large, self-contained, [[theming|themed]] atria, each dedicated to a single topic (similar to the style of [[world’s fair]] pavilions) and designed as immersive theatrical “learning worlds.” As of 2018, COSI contains seven main exhibit areas: Ocean, Energy Explorers, Space, Progress, Gadgets, Life, and the American Museum of National History Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/exhibits|title=COSI - Exhibits &amp; Live Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallways between each learning world are filled with hands-on exhibits and displays.

===Ocean===
The Ocean exhibit is divided into two realms. Accessed via an “underwater cave” through a crashed shipwreck, the cavern path splits as guests pass to the right or left. The pathway to the right leads to a docked [[submarine]] laboratory where hands-on exhibits explore the realities of ocean research, submersibles, SCUBA, water pressure, and remote-operated vehicles. Lilypad Lab focuses on [[drainage basin]] and Central Ohio wildlife. The path forking left from the shipwreck leads to the Temple of Poseidon, an “ancient” stone chamber built around a 30-foot tall statue of [[Poseidon]] with waterfalls, fountains, and water jets. This second realm focuses not on the study of water, but on the properties of water and the stories it inspires – [[laminar flow]], whirlpools, erosion, water bells, and mythology.

===Energy Explorers===
Energy Explorers, which opened in 2013, allows visitors to choose an [[avatar|avatar (computing)]] character that follows the guest to the Home Zone, Transportation Zone, and Product Zone of a town, making decisions via computer kiosks to balance energy efficiency and cost.

===Space===
The Space exhibit area features a replica space station pod to tour, a recreation of [[John Glenn]]'s Friendship 7 spacecraft from the [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], remote-operated vehicles, balance tests, and other hands-on experiments that deal with space flight trajectory, gravitational pull, and simulated rover landings. Space was originally located on Level 2 in its own enclosed atrium exhibit area, entered via a "black hole" spinning funhouse hallway meant to disorient guests. The exhibit itself - like Ocean or Adventure - was in a dark, immersive, themed area, stylized after the 1969 moon landing of [[Apollo 11]]. Under starry skies, guests interacted with "retro" stylized monitors and exhibits with a matching wood-panel / brushed metal motif that was reminiscent of the era and united in style. The exhibit even included a 1960s living room (including shag carpeting) where guests could watch the recorded landing.

When the south end of COSI's building was closed due to lost levies in 2004, the Space exhibit was cut off. As such, it was relocated from Level 2 to an empty gallery on Level 1. In 2012, that area underwent construction to become Energy Explorers, necessitating yet another location switch. Some of the Space exhibit's displays moved to the Mezzanine Level while much remained in storage. With the re-opening of COSI's '''Planetarium''' in November 2014, the location of Space on the Mezzanine leading toward the Planetarium's lobby was reinforced by the return and refurbishment of the rest of Space's exhibits. However, Space still remains the only one of COSI's seven learning worlds to not have its own dedicated, theatrical, immersive atrium, instead being located on the bright Mezzanine bridge, open to the Atrium and entryway. The original home of Space is now Gallery 3, available for traveling exhibits and special event rentals. Gallery 3 still contains the ''Galaxy Theater,'' fittingly still painted with murals of planets and stars left over from its time as a live theater for Space.

===Progress===
The Progress exhibit (modeled after the “Streets of Yesteryear” exhibit at COSI’s original location) traces the hopes and fears of a small town called Progress in 1898, just as electricity, horseless carriages, and canned food become available. The recreated town (specifically, the shops, homes, and restaurants at the corner of Hope Street and Fear Street) includes a telegraph office, livery, stable, grocer, apothecary, and clothiers. After visitors walk through Progress in 1898, they turn the corner enter the same intersection of the same town 64 years later in 1962, where a new set of hopes and fears have arisen.

In 1962, the town of Progress includes an appliance store, working TV studio, radio station (where the telegraph office was), department store, diner, and gas station (replacing the livery). At the exit, the exhibit challenges guests to consider how the streets of the village of Progress might look today, and to question why the concept of [[progress (history)|progress]] deserves as much weight in scientific study as that of oceans, space, or energy.

===Gadgets===
The Gadgets exhibit area contains many classic science museum hands-on experiments, such as [[pulleys]], wind tunnels, [[plasmaglobes]], magnets, light bulbs, engines, and counterweights. As well, Gadgets contains the ‘Gadgets Café’, where families are seated and given a “menu” with quick science experiments to choose from. A “take-apart” menu allows visitors to disassemble donated phones, computers, clocks, and other electronic devices, which are recycled afterward.

===Life===
Life explores humanity through three separate areas dedicated to mind, body, and spirit. The ''Mind'' area contains optical illusions, physical illusions, an [[anechoic chamber]], and a posable [[zoetrope]]. ''Spirit'' discusses the concept of birth and death and how human cultures understand them. ''Body'' features interactive health stations where visitors can record their weight, flexibility, and heart rate, then compare their statistics to that of COSI visitors and national averages. Life also contains the ''Labs in Life'', three working medical research pods staffed by [[Ohio State University|OSU]] Health &amp; Medicine students and staff.[[File:Main COSI Columbus Sign 1.jpg|thumb|right]]

=== Dinosaur Gallery ===
On November 19 of 2017, COSI, in partnership with the [[American Museum of Natural History]], opened a permanent Dinosaur Gallery. In addition, a traveling special exhibition gallery opened in Spring of 2018. Together, they will occupy 22,000 square feet on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=Columbus Dispatch|last=Gordon|first=Ken|date=September 16, 2016|work=|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
The building also contains an interactive '''“little kidspace”''' area designed for children up through first grade, the '''National Geographic Giant Screen Theater''' (the largest digital screen in Ohio), and an outdoor '''Big Science Park'''. On November 22, 2014, COSI reopened its 60-foot diameter, 220-seat '''[[Planetarium]]''' (Ohio’s largest) with all new digital projection. In addition, there is a '''History of COSI''' exhibit.

The building also includes three large '''Galleries''' for traveling exhibits and special event hosting, a Dive Theater in Ocean, the Galaxy Theater in Gallery 3 (its name a remnant of when Gallery 3 was once the Space exhibit), the Gadgets Stage, the Atomic Cafe, the Science2Go! retail store, and five meeting rooms utilizing refurbished areas within the former Central High School, which the new COSI location was built around.

==History==
[[File:Central High School 1.jpg|thumb|Historic Central High School is now part of COSI]]
COSI opened on March 29, 1964, as a venture of the Franklin County Historical Society. COSI is a founding member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC) and a long-standing member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC).

From its 1964 opening, COSI was housed in Memorial Hall, a Columbus landmark constructed in 1906. COSI closed at the Memorial Hall location on East Broad Street on September 6, 1999, and re-opened two months later on November 6, 1999, at its new location on the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] riverfront in [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]]. The new, 320,000 square foot facility is one of the largest modern-built science centers in the world. The building was designed by internationally renowned Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]], who designed an elliptical, geometric, "blimp" shaped structure composed of 159 curved concrete panels.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/projects/applications/public/cultural/COSI.cfm|title=High Concrete Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI is designed to appear progressively futuristic from the neighborhood of Franklinton, while from downtown Columbus it uses the exterior of the original Central High School to blend into the city.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"/&gt;

[[Image:COSIHolidayPhoto.JPG|thumb|COSI's Holiday Science of the Season Celebration annually from the day before Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve.]]
Shortly after the move to the riverfront, the museum experienced a shortfall of funds. With an initial construction budget of over $210 million, high maintenance costs of the new facility, "six figure" utility bills, and "lower-than-expected" ticket sales, COSI's reliance on admission revenue proved to be an unsuitable long term plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1388&amp;dat=20040421&amp;id=eodQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3245,2222827|title=COSI Planetarium to go black; other programs scaled back}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the museum spearheaded an effort to assess a property tax levy, chaired by former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] [[John Glenn]]. The levy would have imposed a property tax on residents of [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]], who would receive free admission in return. The levy failed. As a result, the south wing of COSI's "blimp" structure was closed.

As part of the reconfiguration of the museum following the loss of the levy in 2004, COSI opened only five days per week instead of seven. Many of the museum's exhibits were announced to close permanently (though many have re-opened in stages in the years since).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cosi-to-reallocate-exhibit-spaces-in-september-71781782.html|title=COSI to reallocate exhibit spaces in September}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the original exhibit areas were closed permanently (called '''i|o''' and '''SimZone''', the spaces they formerly occupied are now Gallery 1 and Energy Explorers, respectively).

Closures from 2004 that have since been reversed include Space (relocated to Level 1 in 2005, then to the Mezzanine in 2012), the original Gallery 1 (space reused as WOSU@COSI in September 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocio.osu.edu/blog/community/2006/09/28/wosucosi-grand-opening-set-for-september-29|title=WOSU@COSI Grand Opening}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Adventure (re-opened as an additional-charge experience in September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/07/12/COSI_to_reopen_Adventure_exhibit.html|title=COSI to reopen popular Adventure exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt;), CityView (still off limits to the public; now available for special events), and the Planetarium (re-opened in November 2014 as the final piece of the building to come back online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/11/20/cosi-gets-star-attraction.html|title=COSI's renovated planetarium to reopen after decade absence}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Image:Columbus-ohio-cosi-summer.jpg|thumb|COSI from across the Scioto River.]]

During the spring and summer of 2005, COSI hosted the blockbuster traveling exhibition "[[RMS Titanic|Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition]]" and saw record attendance (prompting the return of the exhibit in 2010). In the summer 2006, COSI hosted another large exhibit: "[[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]]", produced by the [[Museum of Science, Boston]].

In April 2006 Dr. David Chesebrough, former president and CEO of the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], became COSI's new president and CEO.  He replaced  former NASA astronaut [[Kathryn D. Sullivan]], who transitioned to a new role as COSI science advisor on a volunteer basis while serving in her new role as the Director of [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy.

Since then, COSI has integrated additional-cost traveling exhibits as part of its funding model. The museum has hosted ''EINSTEIN, An Exhibition on the Man and his Science'' (2007), ''Animation featuring Cartoon Network'' (2007), ''Gregor Mendel: Planting the Seeds of Genetics '' (2007), ''Bob the Builder: Project Build It'' (2007), ''Goosebumps!  The Science of Fear'' (2008), ''CSI: The Experience'' (2008), ''Adventures with Clifford the Big Red Dog'' (2010), ''Geckos: From Tail to Toepads'' (2011), ''Dinosaurs: Explore.  Escape. Survive.'' (2011), Dora and Diego - Let's Explore! (2011), RACE: Are We So Different? (2012), WATER (2012), LEGO Castle Adventure (2012), BODYWORLDS and The Brain (2012), MindBender Mansion and Amazing Mazes (2013), MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition (2013), Curious George: Let's Get Curious! (2013), and Sherlock: The Exhibition (2014). As well, COSI developed its own traveling exhibit, ''Lost Egypt: Ancient Secrets, Modern Science'' (2009) in cooperation with the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, built by the Science Museum of Minnesota.  ''Lost Egypt'' now travels the nation to other museums.

In January 2016, Dr. Chesebrough announced that he planned to retire at the end of 2016.  A executive search firm was contracted, and an advisory committee formed, to identify candidates to succeed him as president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/29/COSI_president_announces_retirement.html|title=President who helped revive COSI announces he'll retire|author=Shannon Gilchrist|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2016, the Capitol South Community Redevelopment Corp. announced the approval of a $37 million plan to replace the 600-spot parking lots on COSI's west side with an underground parking garage topped with an 8-acre green space and programmatic park as a compliment to the larger Scioto Peninsula green space along the [[Scioto River]].

On September 16, 2016, COSI announced a partnership between the city of Columbus and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in [[New York City]] to build a $5 million permanent Dinosaur Exhibition Gallery and a dedicated AMNH Traveling Exhibition Gallery replacing the WOSU and Adventure exhibits. The WOSU exhibit has since relocated; however, the Adventure exhibition closed permanently on January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="dispatch.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;$5 million from state budget to bring dinosaur exhibit to COSI]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nbc4i.com/2016/09/21/cosi-will-close-adventure-exhibit-to-make-room-for-natural-history-exhibits/|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;COSI will close ‘Adventure’ exhibit to make room for natural history galleries]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 21, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2016, the COSI board of trustees announced the selection of Dr. Frederic Bertley as COSI Columbus' new president and CEO, effective January 1, 2017. Dr. Bertley was previously senior vice president for science and education at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/10/new-president-and-ceo-of-cosi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2017, the Adventure exhibit permanently closed to make room for COSI's Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com" /&gt;

The '''calculus of concepts''' is an abstract language and theory, which was developed to simplify the reasons behind effective messaging when delivered to a specific target or set of targets. The theory aims to maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes, by using messaging elements and techniques while analyzing the delivery mechanisms in certain scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|title=Influence : the psychology of persuasion|year=2007|publisher=Collins|location=New York|isbn=006124189X|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of uncertainty, but not its elimination, is often cost effective and practical.

Empowered by the [[Internet of Things|internet of things (IoT)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashton|first=Kevin|title=That 'Internet of Things' Thing - RFID Journal|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986|publisher=RFID Journal|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the framework looks at numerous device such as [[smart phones]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptops]], hand held gaming devices, GPS devices, automobile Event Data Recorders and other electronic devices as remote sensors capable of providing data channels.&lt;ref name="Hubris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculus of Concepts Case Study - February 2013|url=http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf|publisher=Hubris Analytics|accessdate=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228034548/http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf#|archive-date=2013-02-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using elements, the theory discovers underlying key concepts and their relations to better understand how messages can by used to elicit desired behaviors through mental model [[heuristics]] and [[biases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klien|first=Gary|title=Streetlights and Shadows: Searching for the Keys to Adaptive Decision Making|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262516721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework does not serve up spam to potential consumers; it is a new paradigm for effective messaging. The nature of the data produced and consumed by devices in the IoT naturally lends itself to location-based awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associati|first=Casaleggio|title=The Evolution of Internet of Things|url=http://www.casaleggio.it/pubblicazioni/Focus_internet_of_things_v1.81%20-%20eng.pdf|publisher=Casaleggio.it|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] and real-time broadcasting of key messages gives the framework an extra dimension, putting it at the forefront of behavioral methodologies. Broadcasting can take place across a number of platforms, text, photographic, video, audio or even direct human contact.

The use of anchoring-and-adjustment, framing and representativeness heuristics provides fertile grounds for “re-wiring” the decision making processes to include either positive or mitigating mental models of a given concept or set of related concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopes|first=Lola L.|title=The Rhetoric of Irrationality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “re-wiring” will often produce results that have a significant impact on later decisions and behaviors on the target audience. The framework analyses key factors that influence the effectiveness of messaging mechanisms and how differing approaches can lead to entirely different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|title=Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator|year=2012|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|isbn=159184553X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The calculus of concepts framework has been practically implemented utilizing a combination of [[Naive Bayes]] classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Harry|title=The Optimality of Naive Bayes|url=http://www.cs.unb.ca/profs/hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM) algorithms to actively identify the key components of a messaging campaign and its effectiveness. The effectiveness of a communications campaign is often measured by numerous results including reach, frequency and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Corinna Cortes|author2=Vladimir Vapnik|title=Machine Learning|date=September 1995|volume=20|issue=3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF0|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training data set for the model implementation utilized the potential messages and delivery mechanisms with Actors, Actions, Objects, Contexts and Indicia as a few examples.

Each concept within the framework is treated by the practical implementation as either an independent or dependent variable (as applicable) and therefore may have a meaningful effect on the outcome of any communication. As with any machine-learning tool the Calculus of Concepts model implementation inputs can be either nominal or ordinal and depending on the particular case.

==Practical example==
Between 2005 and 2012 one of the largest oil companies in China attempted to buy the twelfth biggest oil company in Canada. Initial proposals and takeover plans were rejected due to a number of issues surrounding political tensions.

Stakeholders identified Environment, Context, Domain, Event, Condition, State, Decision, Relation, Actor, Action and Object concepts that needed to be in place to have the key decision makers utilizing the mental models needed to secure the takeover.

Over the next 7 years messaging activities were fielded by the Chinese company and its authorized agents, specifically designed to elicit Ideations and Decisions that would result in the takeover going through. In 2012, the takeover was completed after a coordinated and concerted field messaging activity.&lt;ref name="Hubris" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}. Retrieved 26 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;Amnesty International USA (2007).

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001). "Moral Education through the 3 Rs: Rights, Respect and Responsibility." ''Journal of Moral Education,'' 30, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dead&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2008). "'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009). "Reducing teacher burnout by increasing student engagement." ''School Psychology International,'' 30 (3), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp1&gt;Covell, K., and  Howe, R.B. (2011) "Rights, Respect and Responsibility in Hampshire County RRR and Resilience Report." Available at http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-rrr-resilience-full-report-2011.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp2&gt;Covell, K, Howe, R.B., and Polegato, J. (2011). "Children’s human rights education as a counter to social disadvantage: A case study from England." ''Educational Research,'' 53,(2), 193- 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp3&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K., (2010). "Miseducating children about their rights." ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">'''Community fingerprinting''' is a set of [[molecular biology]] techniques that can be used to quickly profile the [[biodiversity|diversity]] of a [[microorganism|microbial]] community. Rather than directly identifying or counting individual cells in an environmental sample, these techniques show how many variants of a [[gene]] are present. In general, it is assumed that each different gene variant represents a different type of microbe. Community fingerprinting is used by [[microbiologist]]s studying a variety of microbial systems (e.g. marine, freshwater, soil, and human microbial communities) to measure biodiversity or track changes in community structure over time. The method analyzes environmental samples by assaying genomic [[DNA]]. This approach offers an alternative to [[microbiological culture|microbial culturing]], which is important because most microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Madigan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madigan|first=M.T.|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=12th |author2=J.M. Martinko |author3=P.V. Dunlap |author4=D.P. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community fingerprinting does not result in identification of individual microbe species; instead, it presents an overall picture of a microbial community.  These methods are now largely being replaced by high throughput sequencing, such as targeted [[microbiome]] analysis (e.g., 16s rRNA sequencing) and [[metagenomics]].

==Use==
A fingerprinting analysis begins with an environmental sample (e.g. seawater or soil), from which total DNA is extracted. (Total DNA contains a mix of genetic material from all the microbes present in the sample.) A particular gene or DNA region is then selected as a target for analysis, under the assumption that each microbe species will have a different gene variant (also called a "[[phylotype]]"). Different methods (see below) can be used to visualize the phylotypes present in a sample. Because the aim of community fingerprinting is to gain an overall understanding of community structure, it is a particularly useful technique for analyzing [[Time series|time-series]] data collected from the field. For example, one could study the pattern of microbial [[ecological succession|succession]] in a habitat, or one could examine the response of a microbial community to an environmental perturbation, such as the release of a pollutant. Depending on what information is desired, different genes may be targeted. The most common are small subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) genes, such as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. These genes are frequently used in microbial [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses, so well-established techniques exist for their study. Other genes of interest might be those that are key in various metabolic processes.&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantages of community fingerprinting are that it can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply, and the analyses can accommodate a large number of samples simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=T.L.|title=Culture-independent microbial community analysis with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|journal=Methods in Enzymology|year=2005|volume=397|pages=308–329|doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(05)97018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=A.|author2=L.A. Ogilvie|title=Name that microbe: rapid identification of taxa responsible for individual fragments in fingerprints of microbial community structure|journal=Molecular Ecology Notes|year=2004|volume=4|issue=1|pages=133–136|doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties make community fingerprinting especially useful for monitoring changes in microbial communities over time. Also, fingerprinting techniques do not require one to have ''a priori'' sequence data for organisms in a sample.
A disadvantage of community fingerprinting is that it results in largely qualitative, not quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborn|first=A.M. |author2=E.R.B. Moore |author3=K.N. Timmis|title=An evaluation of terminal-restriction  fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis for the study of microbial community  structure and dynamics|journal=Environmental Microbiology|year=2000|volume=2|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2000.00081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using qualitative data, it can be difficult to compare patterns observed in different studies or between different investigators.  Also, community fingerprinting does not directly identify taxa in an environmental sample, though the data output from certain techniques (e.g. [[DGGE]]) can be analyzed further if one desires identification. Some authors point to poor reproducibility of results for certain fingerprinting methods,&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt; while other authors have criticized the inaccuracy of abundance estimates and the inability of some techniques to capture the presence of rare taxa.&lt;ref name="Bent"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bent|first=S.J. |author2=J.D. Pierson |author3=L.J. Forney|title=Measuring species richness based on microbial  community fingerprints: the emperor has no clothes|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2007|volume=73|issue=7|pages=2399–2401|doi=10.1128/aem.02383-06|pmid=17403942|pmc=1855686}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is difficult for the DGGE method to detect microbes that comprise less than 0.5%-1% of a bacterial community.&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kan|first=J.|author2=K.

==Techniques==
This section presents three methods of community fingerprinting.

===Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)===

[[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (T-RFLP) is a method that uses [[fluorescence|fluorescently]]-labeled DNA fragments to produce a community fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=W.-T. |author2=T. L. Marsh |author3=H. Cheng |author4=L.J. Forney|title=Characterization of microbial  diversity by determining terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of genes  encoding 16S rRNA|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1997|volume=63|issue=11|pages=4517–4522}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section presents a brief explanation of T-RFLP ''in the specific context of community fingerprinting''. For a more detailed explanation, refer to the [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]] article.

====Procedure====
To perform T-RFLP (Figure 1), one must select a target gene (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) to amplify by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. At least one [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] used in the PCR reaction is fluorescently labeled at the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5´]] end. After PCR amplification, each copied DNA segment carries the fluorescent label. Next, [[restriction enzyme]]s are used to cut the amplified DNA at specific [[recognition site]]s. The underlying assumption is that each microbe in the sample will have a different sequence on the target gene, so a restriction enzyme will cut each microbe's DNA in a different place. (Each different restriction site is considered to represent a single [[operational taxonomic unit]] [OTU]). Thus, the enzyme will produce one fragment length for each type of microbe present in the sample. The result of digestion is a set of restriction fragments of different lengths, each of which is fluorescently labeled at one end. These are known as "terminal fragments" because they are labeled at the end where the PCR primer attached.  (The unlabeled ends are not recorded in the final analysis.) Next, the fragments are separated by size through either [[gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Laser detection captures the size and fluorescence-intensity patterns of the terminal fragments. DNA standards of known size and fluorescence are included in the analysis as references. By setting a minimum threshold for fluorescence, background noise will be excluded.&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt;
[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using T-RFLP analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 1. Steps of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for a single microbial community with 3 phylotypes]]

====Data output and interpretation====
The output of the laser detection step is an [[electropherogram]] that shows a series of peaks, with fragment length on the horizontal axis and fluorescence intensity on the vertical axis (Figure 1). A second output&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; is a data table that lists the migration time of the fragments, the size in [[base pairs]] of each peak, and the height of and area under each peak.

The theoretical basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent different types of organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats must be taken into account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than absolute abundance, and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; cite other possible factors that may distort results, including "differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification" (p.&amp;nbsp;4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of T-RFLP}}====
The major advantages of T-RFLP are that it is fast and can easily accommodate many samples.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; Also, the visual output simplifies comparison of community structure patterns across different samples. A disadvantage is the broad, qualitative nature of the data output, which must be interpreted with the above caveats in mind. Also, direct identification of microbes in a sample is not possible through T-RFLP.

Park |title=Monitoring of phytoplankton community structure using  terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|year=2010|volume=81|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2010.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tested T-RFLP as a method for phytoplankton monitoring. The authors collected environmental water samples from reservoirs in a time series. After comparison of samples with known terminal restriction fragments (from a database built from cultures), they concluded that T-RFLP can be used effectively as a technique for monitoring ''changes'' in the phytoplankton community. However, diversity and abundance estimates were found to be less accurate than those found through other methods.

===Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)===

====Procedure====
[[Dgge|Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)]] is a microbial fingerprinting technique that separates [[amplicon]]s of roughly the same size based on sequence properties&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; (Figure 2). These properties dictate the threshold at which DNA denatures. The DGGE gel uses a gradient DNA denaturant (a mixture of urea and formamide), or a linear temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=Muyzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G.|title=DGGE/TGGE a method for identifying genes from natural ecosystems|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=1999|volume=2|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)80055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fragment reaches its melting point (threshold of enough denaturant), it stops moving. This is due to the fact that a partially melted double-stranded DNA can no longer migrate through the gel.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=S.G.|author2=L.S. Lerman|title=DNA fragments differing by single base-pair substitutions are separated in denaturing electrophoreseis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=PNAS|year=1983|volume=80|number=6|pages=1579–1583|doi= 10.1073/pnas.80.6.1579 |pmc=393645}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GC clamp (about 40 bases with high GC content) is used as a special [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to anchor the [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] fragments together once they have [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]].&lt;ref name=Rettedal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rettedal|first=E.A.|author2=S.

[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using DGGE analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 2. The microbial fingerprinting technique called Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The diagram demonstrates how samples from different microbial communities can be compared.]]

====Data output and interpretation====
Each lane on a gel represents one microbial community. The shared bands among the samples are the same size and roughly the same position on the gel. The gene variants that are not shared amongst microbial community samples do not match up horizontally with others. For example, if the gene of interest is 16S rRNA, as it was when the technique was first described, the PCR-amplified fragments will be in the same vertical location because they are all roughly the same size.&lt;ref name=Muyzer2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G. |author2=E.C. De Waal |author3=A.G. Uitterlinden |title=Profiling of complex microbial populations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1993|volume=59|pages=695–700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another target gene may have greater variation in length, but the denaturant gradient uses a second element (of melting point) to further distinguish between the samples. The DGGE gel will separate genes of the same size based on base sequence.

This technique shows to what extent microbial communities are the same or different in taxonomic composition. Each band in a different location on the gel represents a different phylotype (one unique sequence of a phylogenetic marker gene).&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; For microbial communities this method profiles many individual 16S rRNA sequences.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.M.|author2=M. J. Ferris |author3=S. C. Nold |author4=M. M. Bateson |title=A natural view of microbial biodiversity within hot spring cyanobacterial mat communities|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|year=1998|volume=62|pages=1353–1370|pmid=9841675 |pmc=98949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bands at differing horizontal positions can be used to estimate the level of biodiversity in that sample and infer phylogenetic affiliation.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; In order to know more about phylogenetic affiliation, one could excise those bands from the gel and then sequence them.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of DGGE}}====
The use of denaturing profile serves as a way to separate DNA fragments of similar sizes. This is beneficial in assessing microbial diversity due to the fact that the 16S rRNA gene does not vary much in size across bacterial phyla. The DGGE gel provides a quick way of looking at biodiversity in a microbial sample and does not preclude the option of sequencing the bands of interest. This method does not require that the microbes be cultured in the lab and does not require any sequence data needed to design probes for hybridization methods.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; The main disadvantage is that this is a qualitative assessment of biodiversity and one must sequence the genes in order to make inferences about the phylogenetic relatedness. Another disadvantage is that the GC clamp can be variable each time it is synthesized. This leads to the potential for different DGGE profiles for the same 16S rRNA sequence.&lt;ref name="Rettedal" /&gt;

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of DGGE}}====
Stephen ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Stephen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen|first=J.R. |author2=G. A. Kowalchuk |author3=M-A. V. Bruns |author4=A. E. McCaig |author5=C. J. Phillips |author6=T. M.

Prosse |title=Analysis of β-subgroup Proteobacterial ammonia oxidizer populations in soil by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and hierarchical phylogenetic probing|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1998|volume=64|pages=2958–2965}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilized DGGE for a rapid analysis of Proteobacteria in soil. They obtained an initial assessment of microbial diversity in their environmental samples from soil maintained for 36 years at the various pH values. They combined DGGE and hybridization techniques by probing the DNA fragments to obtain more detail about the natural populations. In this study, they were looking at a group of closely related bacterial types, all autotrophic β–proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. The 16S rDNA samples yielded ambiguous overlapping bands when run out on a gel. The ambiguous overlapping bands were separated with cluster-specific radiolabelled probes, which yielded information of the relative abundance of the different genotypes in samples.

Ward ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; examined cyanobacterial mat communities in a Yellowstone hot spring by using DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene segments of aerobic chemoorganotrophic populations. DGGE allowed them to profile the community gaining new insight to diversity. They characterized the bands of interest by purifying and sequencing and detected many lineages previously unknown to be present.

===(Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) ===

====Procedure====

(Automated) [[ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis]], or (A)RISA (Figure 3), takes advantage of the fact that prokaryotic DNA encodes for two highly conserved genes, the 16SrRNA gene and the 23SrRNA gene. These encode the small and large subunit genes in the rRNA operon. Between these two genes, there is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Due to the fact it is non-coding for proteins, it is a highly variable nucleotide sequence and length. Once DNA is isolated from a community, PCR amplifies this spacer region. The fragments can be run out on a gel (RISA), or the fluorescent primers can be translated into peaks in abundance of the different fragments lengths on an [[electropherogram]] (ARISA).&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=M.M.|author2=E.W. Triplett|title=Automated approach for ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of microbial diversity and its application to freshwater bacterial communities|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1999|volume=65|pages=4630–4636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranjard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranjard|first=L. |author2=F. Poly |author3=J.-C. Lata |author4=C. Mougel |author5=J. Thioulouse |author6=S. Nazaret |title=Characterization of bacterial and fungal soil communities by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis fingerprints: biological and methodological variability|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2001|volume=67|pages=4479–4487|doi=10.1128/aem.67.10.4479-4487.2001|pmc=93193}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using ARISA analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 3. The microbial fingerprinting technique called (Automated) Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis. The diagram shows the output of both Automated RISA (Pathway 1) or RISA (Pathway 2).]]

====Data output and interpretation====
Due to variable non-coding regions, the output for RISA is a gel with different banding patterns, and output for ARISA is an electropherogram  with different peaks (similar to T-RFLP).

The brightness of the fluorescently labeled primers correlates to how prevalent that bacterial type is in the community. The banding pattern on the gel can be interpreted as a community-specific profile. Each DNA band or peak indicates at least one representative of that organism.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; In RISA, the bands on gel that do not match up in length represent different organisms in the community because they have different spacer regions between the two highly conserved genes. The electropherogram shows peaks correlating to the relative abundance of that spacer region in the sample.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of ARISA}}====
ARISA can have a higher resolution in detecting microbial diversity as compared to [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]].&lt;ref name=Danovaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danovaro|first=R. |author2=G. M. Luna |author3=A. Dell’Anno |author4=B. Pietrangeli|title=Comparison of two fingerprinting techniques, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, for determination of bacterial diversity in aquatic environments|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2006|volume=72|pages=5982–5989|doi=10.1128/aem.01361-06 |pmid=16957219 |pmc=1563681}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities can be compared to databases for overlap with culturable organisms.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One can design phylum-level oligonucleotide primers to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment.

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of ARISA}}====
Ranjard ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ranjard" /&gt; discuss several examples of types of studies in which RISA can be used. They cite several studies that have used this technique to fingerprint bacterial communities following such disturbances as antibiotic treatment, mercury stress and deforestation. They also demonstrated the successful use of ARISA for characterizing fungal communities, which is an aspect of microbial ecology that remains to be fully explored.

They used ARISA to profile the community structure and look at microbial succession over stages in the composting process. They took DNA samples and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify community members at the different phases of the process. Then they used ARISA to look at community-wide changes and then matched up the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the most common ARISA fragments to identify these microbial community members.

In 1965 the Seminar on '''Comprehensive Musicianship''' was held at [[Northwestern University]]. Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Airlie House (a conference center) in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] to discuss means of evaluating comprehensive musicianship. The resultant document, ''Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education'', offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies.

There are two curricula that are examples of the Comprehensive Musicianship methodology: The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program and the Hawaii Music Curriculum Program.

==Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program==
{{Main|MMCP – Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program (MMCP) was funded by a grant from the [[U.S. Dept. of Education]] and was named for [[Manhattanville College]] in [[Purchase, New York]]. Its objectives were to develop a music curriculum and related materials for a sequential music learning program for the primary grades through high school. The project produced the ''Synthesis'', a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12, ''Interaction'', an early childhood curriculum, and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Laboratory, the Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program.

MMCP began in 1965 with an exploratory of 92 innovative and experimental music programs. Phase One (1966) dealt with perspectives of student learning potentials, problems of curriculum reform, and classroom procedures. Phase Two (1967) dealt with the refinement and synthesis of information gained in the first exploratory period and the organization of information into a feasible curriculum. Phase Three (1968) consisted of the refinement and field testing of all curriculum items, the initial investigation of a separate curriculum for early childhood, the preparation and testing of plans for teacher retraining, and the development of an assessment instrument that reflected the program objectives.

==Hawaii Music Curriculum Program==

The Hawaii Music Curriculum Program began in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Hawaii Curriculum Center in Honolulu. Its purpose was to create a logical, continuous educational program ensuring the competent guidance of the music education of all children in the state's public schools and to test and assemble the materials needed by schools to realize this program. Students are to be involved with music in school in the same ways that people are involved with music in the outside world. The curriculum is based on seven basic concepts: tone, rhythm, melody, harmony, form, tonality, and texture, that are presented in the form of a spiral curriculum. The taxonomy of concepts was translated into a curriculum by means of division into five "zones."{{clarify|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">A '''cross-genre''' (or '''hybrid genre''') is a [[literary genre|genre]] in [[fiction]] that blends themes and elements from two or more different genres. As opposed to the (literary and political) conservatism of most [[genre fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; cross-genre writing offers opportunities for opening up debates and stimulating discussion.

Such hybrid genres are not new but a longstanding element in the fictional process: perhaps the most famous example is [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', with its blend of poetry, prose, and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singer/W. Walker, ''Bending Genre'' (2013) p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s trilogy [[Poena Damni]] ([[Z213: Exit]], [[With the people from the bridge]], [[The First Death]]) combines fictional prose with drama and poetry in a multilayered narrative developing through the different characters of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/reviews-march/ |title=Reviews: Z213: Exit by Dimitris Lyacos &amp;#124; Write From Wrong Literary Magazine |publisher=Writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic discontinuites==
[[Fredric Jameson]] has highlighted the progressive elements in Third World Literature that defies genre expectations such as [[Xala (novel)|Xala]]; and in [[science fiction]] like ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' with its exploration of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weekes eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 334 and p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Koontz]] considers himself  a cross-genre writer, not a [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer: “I write cross-genre books-suspense mixed with love story, with humor, sometimes with two tablespoons of science fiction, sometimes with a pinch of horror, sometimes with a sprinkle of paprika...”&lt;ref&gt;Koontz, Dean.

==History==

The National Meteorological Institute was established in 1919 shortly after the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]] was established at the end of [[World War I]]. On January 1, 1954, the National Meteorological Institute was united with the hydrology service and the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute was established. Its charter was amended in 1994 and in 1995 by the Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic.

==Air pollution dispersion modelling activities==

The Air Quality Protection division has seven departments:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chmi.cz/uoco/struct/structe.html Structure of CHMI's Air Quality Control Division] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002204554/http://www.chmi.cz/uoco/struct/structe.html |date=2006-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Modelling and Expertise Pool department is focused upon: the development of [[Air pollution dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]]; the application of such models in the preparation of expert reports and opinions; forecasts of air quality control; the processing of operating information on pollutant concentrations obtained by the Airborne Monitoring section. 

The SYMOS97 air pollution dispersion model was developed at the CHMI. It models the dispersion of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|continuous, neutral or buoyant plumes]] from single or multiple [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point, area or line sources]]. It can handle complex terrain and it can also be used to simulate the dispersion of [[cooling tower]] plumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.meng.auth.gr/mds/strquery.php?wholedb The Model Documententation System (MDS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102135620/http://pandora.meng.auth.gr/mds/strquery.php?wholedb |date=2007-11-02 }} of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (part of the European Environment Agency)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''debtors' prison''' is a [[prison]] for [[Natural person|people]] who are unable to pay [[debt]]. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked [[workhouses]]) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in places like [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Cory"&gt;Cory, Lucinda. [http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2,%20iss2.PDF "A Historical Perspective on Bankruptcy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228083132/http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2%2C%20iss2.PDF |date=February 28, 2008 }}, ''On the Docket'', Volume 2, Issue 2, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Rhode Island, April/May/June 2000, retrieved December 20, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Destitute persons who were unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be incarcerated in these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance. The product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the [[history of bankruptcy law]] have made prison terms for unaggravated [[indigence]] illegal over most of the world.

Since the late 20th century, the term ''debtors' prison'' has also sometimes been applied by critics to [[criminal justice system]]s in which a court can sentence someone to prison over willfully unpaid [[Criminal procedure|criminal fees]], usually following the order of a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justanswer.com/topics-contempt-of-court/|title=What is Contempt of Court and other Contempt of Court Questions Answered|work=JustAnswer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in some jurisdictions within the [[United States]], people can be held in [[contempt of court]] and jailed after willful non-payment of [[Child support in the United States|child support]], garnishments, confiscations, fines, or back taxes. Additionally, though properly served [[Civil procedure|civil duties]] over private debts in nations such as the United States will merely result in a [[default judgement]] being rendered ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' if the defendant willfully declines to appear by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasonlawfirm.com/archives/548|title=What Happens If I Get Sued?|work=nasonlawfirm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a substantial number of indigent debtors are legally incarcerated for the crime of failing to appear at civil debt proceedings as ordered by a judge. In this case, the crime is not indigence, but disobeying the judge's order to appear before the court.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tampa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calpen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harrington1"/&gt;  Critics argue that the "willful" terminology is subject to individual [[mens rea]] determination by a judge, rather than statute, and that since this presents the potential for judges to incarcerate legitimately indigent individuals, it amounts to a de facto "debtors' prison" system.

== History ==

=== Medieval Europe ===
During Europe's [[Middle Ages]], debtors, both men and women, were locked up together in a single, large cell until their families paid their debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlesdepo.com/loans/56618.php Articlesdepo.com] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt prisoners often died of diseases contracted from other debt prisoners. Conditions included starvation and abuse from other prisoners. If the father of a family was imprisoned for debt, the family business often suffered while the mother and children fell into poverty. Unable to pay the debt, the father often remained in debtors' prison for many years. Some debt prisoners were released to become [[serf]]s or [[indentured servant]]s ([[debt bondage]]) until they paid off their debt in labor.

== By region ==

=== Canada ===
{{main|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 1 of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Protocol 4 - civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion|Protocol 4]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] prohibits the imprisonment of people for breach of a contract. Turkey and the United Kingdom (due to concerns over British nationality law) have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.

=== France ===

France allows for ''contrainte par corps'', now denominated ''contrainte judiciaire'', for money owed to the State by non-insolvant debtors aged from 18 to 65; its length is limited following the amount of the debt and aims to pressure the debtor to pay his debts, consequently the owed money stays owed to the State.

=== Germany ===
[[File:Nuernberg-maennereisen-v-nw.jpg|thumb|right|Schuldturm in [[Nuremberg]]]]
In the late Middle Ages, and at the beginning of the modern era, public law was codified in Germany. This served to standardize the coercive arrest (''Pressionshaft''), and got rid of the many arbitrary sanctions that were not universal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html Berlinonline.de] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215014/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas (like Nürnberg) the debtor could sell or redistribute their debt.

In most of the cities, the towers and city fortifications functioned as jails. For certain sanctions there were designated prisons, hence some towers being called debtors' prison (''Schuldturm''). The term ''Schuldturm'', outside of the Saxon constitution, became the catchword for public law debtor’s prison.

In the early modern era, the debtor’s detainment or citizen’s arrest remained valid in Germany. Sometimes it was used as a tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, [[replevin]] or a form of [[trover]]. This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person’s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (''Strafvollzug'') e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain amount of days, graduated by how much they owed.

The [[North German Confederation]] eliminated debtors' prisons on May 29, 1868.

At present a comparable concept to debtors' prison still exists in various forms in Germany:{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* A maximum of 6 weeks coercive arrest for failure to pay fine (''Bußgeld'').
* A maximum of 6 months coercive arrest for failure to issue an oath of not being able to pay any kind of liability.
* As an alternative sentence, if a fine (''Geldstrafe'') is not paid, up to 6 months.
* As a personal arrest for the securing of a foreclosure or garnishment on wages.
* Failure to pay child support as ordered by court, which is a crime under the Penal Code.

=== Great Britain (later the United Kingdom) ===
[[File:St Briavels Castle Debtors Prison.jpg|thumb|right|A mid-Victorian depiction of the debtors' prison at [[St Briavels Castle]]]]
In England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A 20th Century Debate About Imprisonment for Debt|last = Ware|first = Stephen|date = July 2014|journal = American Journal of Legal History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prison term did not alleviate a person's debt, however; an inmate was typically required to repay the creditor in-full before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors’-prisons|title = In a Nutshell: Debtor's Prisons|date = February 10, 2015|accessdate = |website = History Extra|publisher = BBC|last = Wilkes|first = Jonny|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102229/http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors%E2%80%99-prisons|archivedate = December 12, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the later [[United Kingdom]], debtors' prisons varied in the amount of freedom they allowed the debtor. With a little money, a debtor could pay for some freedoms; some prisons allowed inmates to conduct business and to receive visitors; others (including the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[King's Bench Prison]]s) even allowed inmates to live a short distance outside the prison—a practice known as the 'Liberty of the Rules'—and the Fleet even tolerated clandestine '[[Fleet Marriage]]s'.

Life in these prisons, however, was far from pleasant, and the inmates were forced to pay for their keep. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet [[John Byrom]], was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1725, and in 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]], in which he raged against the injustices of the system. Some debtor prisoners were even less fortunate, being sent to prisons with a mixture of vicious criminals and petty criminals, and many more were confined to a single cell.

The father of the [[England|English]] author [[Charles Dickens]] was sent to one of these prisons (the [[Marshalsea Prison|Marshalsea]]), which were often described in Dickens's novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charles-dickens.com/ Charles Dickens Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121741/http://www.charles-dickens.com/ |date=2010-12-15 }} at charles-dickens.com&lt;/ref&gt; He became an advocate for debt prison reform, and his novel ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' dealt directly with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Charles Dickens, Social Worker in His Time|last = Andrews|first = Arlene B.|date = October 2012|journal = Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debtors' Act of 1869]] limited the ability of the courts to sentence debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so.  Debtors who had the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/32-33/62/part/I|title = Debtors Act of 1869|date = |accessdate = 6 December 2015|website = |publisher = The National Archives (UK)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, there was a significant reduction in the number of debtors imprisoned following the passage of the 1869 Act.   By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judicial Statistics, England and Wales, Part 2|last = |first = |publisher = Great Britain Home Office|year = 1907|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/?id=64AzAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by 1905 that  number had increased to 11,427.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of London's debtors' prisons were the [[Coldbath Fields Prison]], [[Fleet Prison]], [[Giltspur Street Compter]], [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Marshalsea Prison]], [[Poultry Compter]], and [[Wood Street Counter]]. The most famous was [[The Clink|the Clink prison]], which had a debtor's entrance in Stoney Street. This prison gave rise to the British slang term for being incarcerated in any prison, hence "in the clink". Its location also gave rise to the term for being financially embarrassed, "stoney broke".

=== Greece ===
Ιmprisonment for debts, whether to the tax office or to a private bank, was still practiced until January 2008, when the law changed after imprisonment for unpaid taxes, as well as other debts to the government or to the social security office, was declared unconstitutional after having been practiced for 173 years; imprisonment was, however, still retained for debts to private banks.{{clarify|date=April 2009}} The situation regarding imprisonment (προσωποκράτηση (prosōpokrάtēsē): custody) for debts to the government is still unclear, as courts continue to have this ability for criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 Reporto.gr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184819/http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
{{main|Castellania (Valletta)}}
An eighteenth century debtors' prison is found within the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], Malta, now used as offices by the Ministry for Health. It remained in use as a prison until the nineteenth century. People who fail to pay their debts today are given prison sentences to be served at Corradino Prison in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]].

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Debtors in the [[United Arab Emirates]], including [[Dubai]], are imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. This is a common practice in the country. Banks are not sympathetic to the debtors once they are in prison, so many just choose to leave the country where they can negotiate for settlements later. The practice of fleeing UAE to avoid arrest because of debt defaults is considered a viable option to customers who are unable to meet their obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html|work=The New York Times|title=Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/how-the-world-is-dealing-with-the-issue-of-debtors|work=The National|title=How the world is dealing with the issue of debtors|first=Wayne|last=Arnold|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===

==== Early debtors' prisons (colonization–1850) ====
Many Colonial American jurisdictions established debtors' prisons using the same models used in Great Britain. [[James Wilson]], a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], spent some time in a debtors' prison while still serving as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/wilson.htm |publisher=ushistory.org |location= |title=James Wilson 1742-1798 |first=Thomas |last=Kindig |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710163946/http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/wilson.htm |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow signatory [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] spent three years, from 1798 to 1801, in the Prune Street Debtors' Prison, [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|title=The Real History of the American Revolution|date=2007|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/washington-square.htm|publisher=ushistory.org|title=Washington Square: Go to Jail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Lee III, better known as [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light-Horse" Lee]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and father of Robert E.

Debtors' prisons were prevalent throughout the [[United States]] up until the mid-1800s. Economic hardships following the [[War of 1812]] with [[Great Britain]] helped swell prison populations with simple debtors. This resulted in significant attention being given to plights of the poor and most dependent jailed under the widespread practice, possibly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Acquisition of Political, Social, and Industrial Rights of Man in America|last=McMaster|first=John B.|year=1903|publisher=Imperial Press|location=Cleveland|isbn=978-1-4097-7187-6|pages=63–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=1816+debtors+prison#v=onepage&amp;q=1816%20debtors%20prison&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing disfavor over debtors' prisons along with the advent and early development of [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy laws]] led states to begin restricting imprisonment for most civil debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

* The routine jailing of persons who owe civil debt when such debts are related to child support arrears. Imprisonment for such debt is legally justified by the legal fiction that the incarceration is not for the debt, but rather for not obeying a court order to pay the debt.

In an article in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Michael Shindler argues that another factor responsible for debtors' prison type arrests is that "Whereas indigent defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a court-appointed lawyer in criminal cases involving incarceration, indigent debtors in state and local courts have no one to defend them against the error and abuse that characterizes debt collection litigation." Similarly, Shindler writes, regarding explicitly illegal debtors' prison type arrests ordered by local judges,"the reason these officials engage in this sort of excessive behavior is often due to ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shindler|first=Michael|date=September 17, 2018|title=Private Creditors Can Put You in Jail|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-travesty-of-private-creditors-putting-people-in-jail/|journal=The American Conservative|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-A debtors' prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked workhouses) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe.[1] Destitute persons unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be sentenced to these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance; the product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the history of bankruptcy law have made prison terms for unaggravated indigence illegal over most of the world.

== International agreements ==
In 1976 Article 11 of the ICCPR – [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] – came into effect stating, "No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfill a contractual obligation."

This international treaty contradicts many domestic laws of ratified states which allows for civil jail.

ESMT ('''Ecole Supérieure Multinationale des Télécommunications''') is an international institution of higher learning based in Senegal. It offers professional certifications and graduate programs in telecommunication.

== History ==

The organisation was created in 1981 by seven West African states, (Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) on the basis of an initial [[UNDP]] programme and funding. In 1986, the school obtained a diplomatic status in Senegal with the headquarters agreement. In 1998, Guinea (Conakry) joined the other seven countries as founding state.

== Activities ==

The organisation is involved in initial training, continuous training and research.

== External links ==

'''The Global Development And Environment Institute''' ('''GDAE''', pronounced “gee-day”) is a research center at [[Tufts University]] founded in 1993. GDAE works to promote a better understanding of how societies can pursue their economic and community goals in an environmentally and socially [[sustainable]] manner. GDAE pursues its mission through original research, policy work, publication projects, curriculum development, conferences and other activities
{{toc right|width=19em}}

==Personnel and programs==
[[Neva Goodwin]]&lt;ref name=rock /&gt; and [[William Moomaw]] are co-directors of GDAE.  The ''Theory and Education'' program, headed by [[Jonathan Harris (economist)|Jonathan Harris]] is developing an economic theory that aims to better serve human needs and address ecological issues. The program explores alternatives to the standard economic paradigm, using new theories and producing educational material.  The ''Research and Policy'' program, led by [[Timothy Wise]], carries out applied research on the effects of economic policies using an analytical framework that assesses the limitations of market-mechanisms for addressing social and environmental issues. Research priorities include [[globalization]], [[food policy]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]], energy and [[climate change]], [[recycling]] and materials use, and sustainable economic integration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Research==
GDAE researchers emphasize ecological health and the correlation between social and economic well-being. They view [[economic system]]s in physical contexts of technology and the natural world, as well as in the social/psychological contexts of history, politics, ethics, culture, institutions, and human motivations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeil|first1=Taylor|title=The Upside of the Downturn|url=http://tuftsjournal.tufts.edu/2009/04_1/features/02/|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=Tufts Journal|date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Between 1995 and 2001 GDAE produced the six-volume series, ''Frontier Issues in Economic Thought'', which was published by [[Island Press]]. The articles that GDAE researchers selected and summarized for this project focus on the limitations of the mainstream economic paradigm and a wide range of creative efforts that have been and are being made to extend economic understanding.&lt;ref name=island /&gt;

===Social Science Library: Frontier Thinking in Sustainable Development and Human Well-being===
GDAE is in the process of distributing an electronic collection of publications for free to universities in 138 nations,&lt;ref name=ssl1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strupp|first1=Julie|title=Africa: American University Distributes Free Social Sciences Library Across Africa|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201309051484.html?aa_source=sptlgt-grid|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=All Africa|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with special attention to those institutions that are most in need of library resources. The collection, or the Social Science Library (SSL), contains over 3,400 full-text journal articles, book chapters, reports, and working papers in anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, social psychology, sociology and political science.&lt;ref name=ssl2 /&gt; It also includes full bibliographic references (including abstracts) to more than 6,000 additional articles. The SSL is being distributed to these countries with the assistance of various partner organizations.&lt;ref name=ssl3 /&gt; For people who are not in the recipient countries, a web-based version, with the 10,000+ bibliographic entries, but without the full text PDFs, can be accessed.&lt;ref name=ssl4 /&gt;

==Leontief Prize==
In 2000, GDAE established the Leontief Prize.  Named in honor [[Wassily Leontief]], Nobel laureate and member of the GDAE advisory board, the annual award recognizes outstanding contributions to economic theory that address contemporary realities and support just and sustainable societies.&lt;ref name="Tufts Now"&gt;{{cite news|title=Macroeconomics in the Age of Climate Change|url=http://now.tufts.edu/articles/macroeconomics-age-climate-change|accessdate=13 January 2016|publisher=Tufts Now|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Ducal Crown of Tuscany''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''corona del Granducato di Toscana'') was a [[Crown (heraldry)|ducal crown]] created by the [[Medici|Medicean]] [[List of rulers of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]].

== The old crown ==
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 36.png|thumb|left|The old grand ducal crown in an engraving.]]
[[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], [[duke]] of [[Florence]], sought to achieve a title which removed him from his status as a [[feudatory]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and gave him more political independence. Getting nothing from the Emperor, he turned to the [[Papacy]]. Already he had attempted to get [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] to give him the title of [[king]] or [[archduke]] with no success. Finally in 1569, after many favours and dealings of differing levels of legitimacy, [[Pope Pius V]] released a [[Papal bull]] which conferred the style of ''[[Serene Highness|Altezza Serenissima]]'' and the title of [[Grand Duke]], a very rare title ranked him above a [[Duke]], but below a [[Prince]].

In January 1570 Cosimo I was crowned by Pius himself at [[Rome]], though by rights such a move was the prerogative of the Emperor. For this reason, [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] refused to recognise the new title, though [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] immediately recognised its validity. With time all Europe came around.

The crown of the Grand Duke of Tuscany was clearly distinct from both princely and ducal crowns. It was a gold circlet decorated with [[emerald]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and [[pearl]]s with rays projecting from the top.

Uniquely the crown had a large [[fleur de lis]] at the front in the centre.

== The new crown ==
[[File:Giangastonecoronation.jpg|thumb|Gian Gastone with the new grand ducal crown, modified from the previous.]]
When [[Cosimo III de' Medici|Cosimo III]], Grand Duke of Tuscany (1670-1723) received the "right to royal rank" from [[Vienna]] added arches and a globe to the top of the grand ducal crown, as these were the typical elements of a royal crown. The new status of the Grand Duchy included among other things a change of style from ''Altezza Serenissima'' to ''[[Royal Highness|Altezza Reale]]''.

The Grand Ducal Crown is only known from drawings and paintings, since it was lost during the Napoleonic Occupation. A copy of the crown was placed in the coffin of each of the Grand Dukes at their funerals. One of these, which belonged to [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] (r. 1723-1737) was recovered during a survey of the corpse and is now conserved in Florence.

This article covers the '''History of Sulzer diesel engines''' from 1898 to 1997. Sulzer Brothers foundry was established in [[Winterthur]], Switzerland, in 1834 by  Johann Jakob Sulzer-Neuffert and his two sons, Johann Jakob and Salomon. Products included cast iron, firefighting pumps and textile machinery. Co-operation with [[Rudolf Diesel]] led to the construction of the first Sulzer [[diesel engine]] in 1898. In 2015, the [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer company]] lives on but it no longer manufactures diesel engines, having sold the diesel engine business to [[Wärtsilä]] in 1997. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sulzer.com/en/About-us/History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derbysulzers.com/sulzerengine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Sulzer built diesel engines for stationary, road, rail and marine use. The engine types usually comprise a number, then some letters, then another number.  For example, 6LDA28 indicates a six-cylinder engine in the "LDA" series with a 28cm cylinder bore.

==Stationary==

{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
Two cylinder engine at King Edward Mine, Camborne(http://kingedwardmine.co.uk/) original application unknown.

==Road==
In 1937, Sulzer introduced an [[opposed piston]] [[two-stroke  diesel engine]] for road use. This was similar to the [[Commer TS3]] but had a piston-type blower instead of a [[Roots blower]]. It was made in two sizes: 69mm bore x 101.6mm stroke or 89mm bore by 120mm stroke. The smaller version had two cylinders, produced 35 hp, and was intended for [[tractor]]s. The larger version was available with two, three or four cylinders and was intended for [[truck]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald H.|title=The Modern Diesel|edition=13th|year=1959|publisher=Iliffe &amp; Sons|location=London|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irregular warfare''' is defined in [[United States]] joint doctrine as “A violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations.”&lt;ref&gt;The Irregular Warrior, 4 October 2015 [http://irregularwarrior.com/2015/10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular warfare favors indirect and asymmetric warfare approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode the adversary’s power, influence, and will. It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a [[State (polity)|state]] and its strategic partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW) Joint Operating Concept (JOC)", Version 1.0, [[United States Department of Defense]], 27 February 2009 [http://morsnet.pbwiki.com/f/MORS+IW+Mini-Symposium+TOR-final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"US Irregular Warfare (IW) Analysis Workshop", [[Military Operations Research Society]] (MORS), 11 September 2007 [http://www.dtic.mil/futurejointwarfare/concepts/iw_joc1_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodd300007"&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW)", DoD Directive 3000.07, [[United States Department of Defense]], 1 December 2008 [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300007p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrennial Roles &amp; Missions (QRM) Review Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], January 2009 [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2009/QRMFinalReport_v26Jan.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare", Doctrine Document 2-3, [[United States Air Force]], 1 August 2007 [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA471742]&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself.&lt;ref name="gates"&gt;Gates, John M., "The U.S. Army and Irregular Warfare", The College of Wooster {{cite web |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623141322/http://www.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |archivedate=2009-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origination of the term ===
The distinction between regular and irregular forces is unrelated to the term "irregular warfare." The term, irregular warfare, was settled upon in distinction from "traditional warfare" and "unconventional warfare", and to differentiate it as such.

=== Early use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term ''irregular warfare'' is in the 1986 English edition of "Modern Irregular Warfare in Defense Policy and as a Military Phenomenon" by [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]].  The original 1972 German edition of the book is titled "Der Moderne Kleinkrieg als Wehrpolitisches und Militarisches Phänomen".  The German word "Kleinkrieg" is literally translated as "Small War".&lt;ref&gt;Moses, A. Dirk, "German intellectuals and the Nazi past," {{ISBN|978-0-521-86495-4}}, 2007 [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1KoR4vF3ysC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=Kleinkrieg+%22Small+War%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K4n_4koqOr&amp;sig=edxYQjmQRaz1H3Z73IPzXkre_Ls&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fEOYSjOpsfEGvf2BxgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Kleinkrieg%20%22Small%20War%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "Irregular", used in the title of the English translation of the book, seems to be a reference non "regular armed forces" as per the aforementioned [[Third Geneva Convention]].

=== US DoD use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term IW is in a 1996 [[Central Intelligence Agency]] document by [[Jeffrey B. White]].&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Jeffrey B., "A Different Kind of Threat, Some Thoughts on Irregular Warfare", CIA, 1996 [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/96unclass/iregular.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[military doctrine]] developments related to IW were done between 2004 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;"The National Military Strategy of the United States of America", [[United States Department of Defense]], 2004 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, LTC Frank A., "Irregular Warfare – Perhaps Not So "Irregular"", U.S. Army War College, 15 March 2006 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The National Security Strategy of the United States of America", National Security Council, 2002 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/national/nss-020920.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A key proponent of IW within US DoD is [[Michael G. Vickers]], a former paramilitary officer in the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Greg, "The Man Behind Irregular Warfare Push: Mike Vickers", DoD BUZZ, 7 April 2009 [http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/04/07/the-man-behind-irregular-warfare-push-mike-vickers/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===US CIA use===

The [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) is the premiere{{clarify|date=April 2018}} unit for unconventional warfare, both for creating and for combating irregular warfare units.&lt;ref&gt;Southworth, Samuel A., Tanner, Stephen, ''U.S. Special Forces: A Guide to America's Special Operations Units: the World's Most Elite Fighting Force'', Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81165-0}}, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030203/|title=Waller, Douglas, "The CIA Secret Army", Time Inc., 3 February 2003|author=|date=|website=time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Kathryn &amp; Williams, Anthony R., ''All Necessary Means: Employing CIA operatives in a Warfighting Role Alongside Special Operations Forces'', [[United States Army War College]] (USAWC), 7 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, SAD paramilitary officers created and led successful irregular units from the Hmong tribe during the war in Laos in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;''Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America's Clandestine War in Laos'', Steerforth Press, {{ISBN|978-1-883642-36-5}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Northern Alliance]] against the [[Taliban]] during the war in Afghanistan in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Woodward|Woodward, Bob]], ''Bush at War'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-7432-0473-5}}, 19 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]] against [[Ansar al-Islam]] and the forces of [[Saddam Hussein]] during the war in Iraq in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Mike &amp; Faddis, Charles, ''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', The Lyons Press, {{ISBN|978-1-59921-366-8}}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob, ''Plan of Attack'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5547-9}}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other definitions==
* IW is a form of warfare that has as its objective the credibility and/or legitimacy of the relevant political authority with the goal of undermining or supporting that authority. IW favors indirect approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities to seek asymmetric approaches, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare Special Study", [[United States Joint Forces Command]] Joint Warfighting Center, 4 August 2006 [http://merln.ndu.edu/archive/digitalcollections/irregwarfarespecialstudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is defined as a violent struggle among [[State (polity)|state]] and non-state actors for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and influence over the relevant [[population]](s)
* IW involves conflicts in which enemy combatants are not regular military forces of nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Quadrennial Defense Review]] Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], 6 February 2006 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/dod/qdr-2006-report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is "war among the people" as opposed to "industrial war" (i.e. regular war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rdsc.md.government.bg/BG/Activities/Publication/MilitaryLead/3-4-Benest.pdf Benest, David, "British Leaders and Irregular Warfare," 29 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Activities and types of conflict included in IW are:
* [[Colonial war]]
* [[Asymmetric warfare]]
* [[Insurgency]]/[[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Terrorism]]/[[Counter-terrorism]]
* [[Stabilization, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations]] (SSTRO)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Guerrilla warfare]] (GW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Civil-military operations]] (CMO)
* [[Military Intelligence]] and [[counter-intelligence]] activities
* [[Transnational crime|Transnational]] [[criminal activities]] that support or sustain IW:
** [[narco-trafficking]]
** [[Illicit arms trafficking]]
** illegal [[financial transactions]]
* [[Outline of law enforcement|Law enforcement]] activities focused on countering irregular adversaries

According to the DoD, there are five core activities of IW:&lt;ref&gt;The Core Activities of Irregular Warfare, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-core-activities-of-irregular-warfare]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Counter-terrorism]] (CT)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Stability Operations]] (SO)

==Examples==
Nearly all modern wars include at least some element of irregular warfare. Since the time of Napoleon, approximately 80% of conflict has been irregular in nature.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Imperitive: Irregular Warfare and the Future of Security, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-imperitive-irregular-warfare-and-the-future-of-security]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the following conflicts may be considered to have exemplified by irregular warfare:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

* [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]]
* [[Algerian War]]
* [[American Indian Wars]]
* [[American Revolutionary War]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to the definition of "regular forces", which came much after the [[American Revolutionary War]] ([[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]), the American forces did not meet the following criteria at all times during the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]:
* having a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance
* carrying arms openly
* conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war
&lt;br&gt;
Notwithstanding, in terms of modern international humanitarian law which was also developed much later than the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]], the American forces formed part of the armed forces of a party to an armed conflict but not belonging to that party's regular forces (since the [[United States of America]] did not exist and hence could not have had regular forces; the American forces were an insurgency at least until 1776) and operating in or outside of their own territory even if the territory is under occupation.

American forces did become regular forces but cannot be considered regular forces during the entire period of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]. For example, the American flag got established (1777) 2 years after the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] started (1775). Also, there were great disparities between the American and British forces.  It was not until France started to assist American forces (1778) that the disparity started to be narrowed.  Conflict during the disparity surely counts as [[Asymmetric warfare]]. Also, the [[Boston Tea Party]] (1773) can be viewed as [[guerrilla]] tactics.  At the very least, a good portion of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] should be counted as IW although the entire [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] being counted as IW is controversial.  However, since more than 1/2 of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] was fought as [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] then it is thought that it is safe to classify it as IW even though that the American forces acted in all respects as regular forces towards the end of the conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Revolution 1774-1783|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mQCRNfiB1-EC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=american+revolution+irregular+warfare#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20revolution%20irregular%20warfare&amp;f=false | first=Daniel | last=Marston | isbn=978-1-84176-343-9 | year=2002 | publisher=Osprey Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11686">'''Kenneth P. Green''' is an environmental scientist and director at the [[Fraser Institute]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Education and career ==
Green holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from [[University of California]], Los Angeles; a Master of Science in Genetics from [[San Diego State University]]; and a Doctorate of Environmental Science and Engineering (D.Env.) from University of California, Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s research has focused on energy and environmental policy at think tanks in North America. After completing his doctoral degree in 1994, he studied environmental policy at the Libertarian [[Reason Foundation]] in California. He then spent three years studying Canadian and American environmental policy at the fiscally-conservative [[Fraser Institute]] in Vancouver, British Columbia. On returning to the United States, Green was executive director of the [[Environmental Literacy Council]] for one year before joining the American Enterprise Institute in 2006. He returned to Canada in 2013, becoming Senior Director, Energy and Natural Resources of the Fraser Institute. There, his research concerned energy and natural resource policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/author.aspx?id=14827&amp;txID=2729]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has also served on advisory and review boards.  From 1996 to 1999, he was a member of the California [[REACH Commission]], and from 1996 to 2001, he was a member of the [[California Departmental Transportation Advisory Committee]]. He has twice served as expert reviewer for publications of the [[United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group]], including a 1999 special report on aviation and the global atmosphere, and a 2001 volume on the science of climate change.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s work has appeared in [[National Review]], Financial Times, [[Wall Street Journal]], Financial Post, [[Washington Post]], [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]]. He has written policy analyses, articles in popular magazine, opinion columns, book chapters, and a textbook for middle-school students entitled ''Global Warming: Understanding the Debate''. In 2011, he published a supplementary textbook for college students studying energy and energy policy, ''Abundant Energy: Fuel of Human Flourishing''. Green has been a guest on talk radio and television news programs, and has given presentations on public policy to student groups, business groups, and legislative staff. He has testified before local, regional, and national regulatory and legislative bodies, including appearances before committees of both houses of the United States Congress, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and U.S. House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2011, in written testimony to the [[United States Senate|United States Senate's]] Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee he said "In conclusion, the idea that government can create jobs in the economy is a myth." During Committee questioning he conceded "It would be absurd to say the government cannot create jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franken|first1=Al|title=Giant of the Senate|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=Twelve|location=2896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he co-authored an article with [[Steven F. Hayward]] entitled, 'Market-Friendly Energy', in ''[[The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs]]'', published by the [[George W. Bush Presidential Center]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Views ==
Green describes himself as “a [[free-market environmentalist]],” and believes that most environmental problems stem from an absence of properly defined and enforced property rights, and/or insufficient societal wealth to afford environmental protection. He has testified that although he believes the environment worth protecting such environmental protection must not harm other American values considered cardinal such as property rights, due process, economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On climate change, Green has repeatedly stated that he believes the climate is warming, and greenhouse gases are partially responsible. He is, however skeptical of computer models that contain unsubstantiated assumptions about positive feedback loops, and he has expressed contempt for computerized projections of future or regional climate change, comparing them to “computerized horoscopes.” Green has testified that as no technology currently exists to significantly and affordably reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, he favors an agenda of adaptation and resilience-building. To hedge against the risk of more extreme climate change, Green favors increased research into [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Concerning energy policy, Green considers himself an “energy realist,” and does not believe there are currently technologies that can substantially or affordably substitute for conventional energy sources such as coal, nuclear power, oil, and natural gas. To the extent that such alternatives do exist, Green has shown they pose environmental and economic challenges, and he believes they should not be hastily adopted without considering potential unintended adverse consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Liber Physiognomiae Michael Scot.jpg|thumb|right|The first page of a 1505 copy of the ''Liber Physiognomiae'', written by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] sometime in the early 13th century.]]
'''''Liber physiognomiae''''' ({{IPA-la|lī.ber fi.si.oː.noː.mi.ae̯|lang}}; '''''The Book of Physiognomy'''''){{#tag:ref|This work is also known as ''De physiognomia et de hominis procreatione'' ({{IPA-la|deː fi.si.oː.noː.mi.a ɛt deː ˈhoː.mɪ.nɪs proː.kreː.aː.ti.oː.nɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning Physiognomy and Human Procreation'') and the ''Physionomia''. During the [[Renaissance]] it was often referred to as ''De secretis nature''&lt;!-- In Medieval Latin, "ae" was often simplified to "e"; as such, "nature" and NOT "naturae" is the correct spelling --&gt; ({{IPA-la|deː seːˈkreː.tīs naː.tu.rɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning the Secrets of Nature'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} is a work by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] concerning [[physiognomy]]; the work is also the final book of a trilogy known as the ''[[Liber introductorius]]''. The ''Liber physiognomiae'' itself is divided into three sections, which deal with various concepts like procreation, generation, dream interpretation, and physiognomy proper.

The information found in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to have been derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works. The work was written in the early 13th century for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], but was first officially printed in 1477. ''Liber physiognomiae'' would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.

== Background ==

''Liber physiognomiae'' was written by the Scottish mathematician [[Michael Scot]] (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the ''[[Liber introductorius]]'' (''The Great Introductory Book'').{{#tag:ref|Some sources refer to the first book in the trilogy as the ''Liber introductorius'',&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: [[#Edwards|Edwards (1985)]]; [[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources specify that the first book is the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and that ''Liber introductorius'' is the name of the trilogy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [[#Meyer|Meyer (2010)]]; [[#Pick|Pick (1998)]], p. 96; [[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This trilogy also includes the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' (''The Book of the Four Distinctions'') and the ''Liber particularis'' (''The Singular Book'').&lt;ref name=resnicknote&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kay5&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott &amp; Marketos (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liber physiognomiae'', as the title suggests, concerns [[physiognomy]], or a technique by which a person's character or personality is deduced based on their outer appearance. Scot refers to this as a "doctrine of salvation" (''Phisionomia est doctrina salutis''), as it easily allows one to determine if a person is virtuous or evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is relatively short, comprising about sixty [[octavo]] pages.&lt;ref name=kay5 /&gt; The work is usually divided into around one hundred chapters, with the number of chapters and their divisions differing greatly depending on what manuscript is being consulted.&lt;ref name=thorn87&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the chapter headings vary across manuscripts, scholars are in agreement that the work is made up of three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;[[#Baynes|Baynes &amp; Smith (1891)]], p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contents&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human [[sexual intercourse]]. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical signs of pregnancy. The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on "animals ''in genere et in specie''" (i.e. in regards to genus and species),{{#tag:ref|In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], Aristotle used the term γένος (génos) to mean a general 'kind' and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind. For instance, "bird" would be a ''génos'', whereas an eagle would be an ''eidos''. ''Génos''and ''eidos'' were later translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leroi|Leroi (2014)]], pp. 88{{en dash}}90.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Scot was writing before the Linnean terms were developed, his use of the words "genus" and "species" retain their Aristotelian meanings.|group="nb"}} while the final details an idiosyncratic system for differentiating the various types of animals.&lt;ref name=thorn8788&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], pp. 87{{en dash}}88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section begins to focus specifically on physiognomy, considering different organs and body regions that index the "character and faculties" of individuals.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=contents /&gt;&lt;ref name=thorn88&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to "temperate and healthy bod[ies] ... repletion of bad [[Humorism|humours]] and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy", before turning to particular sections of the body.&lt;ref name=thorn88 /&gt; Several following chapters discuss [[Dream interpretation|dreams and their meanings]]. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; represent past, present, or future events; or are entirely meaningless.&lt;ref name=thorn89&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning [[augury|auguries]] and sneezes, respectively.&lt;ref name=thorn90&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final section covers body parts, and explicates what the characteristics of these portions may reveal about the nature of the person in question.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; The final chapter in this section warns the would-be physiognomist to withhold judgement based solely on one part of their body, but rather to "tend always to a general judgement based on the majority of all [the person's] members."&lt;ref name=thorn91&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because another part which has not been consulted may readily counter a conclusion suggested by a part that has. Scot also argues that a physiognomist should take into account a person's "age, long residence in one place, long social usage, excessive prevalence of the humours of his complexion beyond what is customary, accidental sickness, violence, accidents contrary to nature, and a defect of one of the five natural senses."&lt;ref name=thorn91 /&gt;

=== Sources ===

According to the physiognomy scholar Martin Porter, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' is a "distinctly Aristotelian" compendium of "the more Arabic influenced 'medical' aspects of natural philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that Scot made use of several Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works in the writing of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', many of which were derived from Arabic copies. The first of these is an Arabic translation of the ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]''.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt; The second is the ''[[Secretum Secretorum|Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār]]'' ({{lang-ar|كتاب سر الأسرار}}; known in Latin as the ''Secreta Secretorum''), an Arabic text that purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student [[Alexander the Great]] on a range of topics, including physiognomy.&lt;ref name=brown3237&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 32{{en dash}}37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|James Wood Brown argues it is "beyond question" that Scot used the Latin-translation of this text, the ''Secretum Secretorum'', in writing the ''Liber physiognomiae''; Haskins, on the other hand, argues that Scot's work is related to the Latin version only "through a common Arabic source".&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown3237 /&gt; Lynn Thorndike seems to favor Haskins hypothesis, aruging "Michael, himself a translator of long standing from the Arabic, could have made direct use of the Arabic text ... Other evidence makes it more likely that Philip knew of Michael's ''Physiognomy'' and that his translation of ''Secreta secretorum'' was subsequent to it."&lt;ref name="thorn91" /&gt;|group="nb"}} The third of these works is ''[[Physiognomonics]]'', also [[Pseudepigrapha|attributed]] to Aristotle and, as the title suggests, also about physiognomy; the influence of this Pseudo-Aristotelian work, according to Haskins, is "limited to the preface" of the ''Liber physiognomiae''.&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown38&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Scot probably used the original Greek version of ''Physiognomonics'' to write his book.{{#tag:ref|Because it is believed that the first Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' was translated directly from the original Greek by Bartholomew of Messina several years after Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was written,&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knuuttila|Knuuttila &amp; Sihvola (2013)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and because no Arabic translation of the work is known to exist, the fact that several passages in Scot's book correspond to passages from Bartholomew of Messina's Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' suggests that the two were working from the same (Greek) source. This is evidence that Scot had a working knowledge of Greek.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;|group="nb"}} The historian [[Charles Homer Haskins]] argues that the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also "makes free use" of [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (also known as Rhazes) and shows "some affinities" with [[Trotula]] texts and writers of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] (a [[medical school]] located in the Italian town of [[Salerno]]).&lt;ref name=haskins262&gt;[[#Haskins|Haskins (1921)]], p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history and popularity ==

[[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|The work was dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]

The work was written sometime in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written for the soon-to-be [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Frederick II in AD 1209 on the occasion of his wedding to [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also adds, "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost [[Fescennine Verses|fescennine]] license which it contains."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 30{{en dash}}31.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that "the emperor [might be able] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;

While manuscripts of the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and the ''Liber particularis'' exist, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' was the only book from the ''Liber introductorius'' trilogy to be professionally printed, with a first print of the book being released in 1477.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Between the date of its official printing and 1660, the work was reprinted eighteen times in many languages; this popularity of the text led Rudolf Hirsch (a book scholar) in 1950 to call the book one of the Middle Ages' "best sellers".&lt;ref name=turner&gt;[[#Turner|Turner (1911)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hirsch|Hirsch (1950)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reprints and its wide circulation is attributed in large part to the advent of the [[printing press]] in 1440.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; Among the many reprints, there is little evidence of textual changes, which is unique for manuscripts published and then transmitted in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hellinga|Hellinga (1998)]], p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' was often bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were combined with a work by [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudo-]][[Albertus Magnus]] entitled ''De secretis mulierum'' (''Concerning the Secrets of Women''), which, according to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', suggests the opinion of the time was that Scot "dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1897)]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise ''[[Fasciculus Medicinae]]'' (although this is not the case for all early copies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled ''Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti'' was published, which featured the ''Liber physiognomiae'' of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and [[Bartolomeo della Rocca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

According to Porter, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was influential for three main reasons: First, Scot developed a number of physiognomical [[aphorism]]s.&lt;ref name=point1&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 69{{en dash}}70.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the popularity of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', Scot's new formulations and ideas, according to Porter, "introduce[d] some fundamental changes into the structure and nature of the physiognomical aphorism."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; (Effectively, what Scot did was add new meanings to various physical features, making the physiognomical signs discussed in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' more complex and, as Porter writes, "[[wiktionary:polyvalent|polyvalent]].")&lt;ref name=point1/&gt; Second, Scot developed a "stronger conceptual link between physiognomy, issues of hereditary, embryology, and generation, which he articulated through astrological ideas of conception."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; Porter argues that this was done because the book was written by Scot to help Frederick II pick a suitable wife (and thus, by extension, produce a suitable heir).&lt;ref name=point2&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Third and finally, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to be the first physiognomical work that takes smell into account. According to Porter, this "totalization" of physiognomy{{em dash}}that is, connecting it to a variety of subjects like reproduction and sense perception{{em dash}}was the most dramatic change that occurred in the way that physiognomy was practiced "as it developed in the period between [[classical Athens]] and late fifteenth-century Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 70{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mikraot Gedolot''''' (מקראות גדולות) "Great Scriptures," often called the "[[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] Bible" in English,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker ''An introduction to Judaic thought and rabbinic literature'' 2007 Page 158 "Moreover, the so-called Rabbinic Bible, the Mikraot Gedolot (“Great Scriptures”), may have as many as ten different commentaries, and notes on the commentaries accompany the text, thus providing a range of possible interpretations of ..."&lt;/ref&gt; is an 
edition of the [[Tanakh]] (in Hebrew) that generally includes four distinct elements:
*The Biblical text according to the ''[[Masoretic Text|masorah]]'' in its letters, [[niqqud|vocalization]], and [[cantillation marks]].
*Masoretic notes on the Biblical text.
*Aramaic [[Targum]].
*[[Bible commentary|Biblical commentaries]] (most common and prominent are medieval commentaries in the ''peshat'' tradition).

Numerous editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been and continue to be published.

== Commentaries ==
In addition to [[Targum Onkelos]] and [[Rashi]]'s commentary – the standard Jewish commentaries on the Hebrew Bible – the Mikraot Gedolot will include numerous other commentaries. For instance, the [[Romm publishing house]] edition of the Mikraot Gedolot contains the following additional commentaries:&lt;ref name="Rommedition"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mikraot Gedolot: Vayikra|year=1899|publisher=Romm Publishing House|location=Vilna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahQwAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dPHuUeq5IMvi4AOekYHYDQ&amp;ved=0CEMQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2013|language=Hebrew, Aramaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ben Hayyim edition==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Miqraoth Gdoloth Bomberg001.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[1524]]]] --&gt;

First published in 1516–17 by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in [[Venice]], the Mikraot Gedolot was edited by the masoretic scholar [[Yaakov ben Hayyim]]. All of its elements - text, [[Masoretic Text|masorah]], [[Targum]], and commentaries were based upon the manuscripts that Ben Hayyim had at hand (although he did not always have access to the best ones according to some, Ginsburg and some others argued that it was a good representation of the [[Ben Asher]] text).

The Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim, though hailed as an extraordinary achievement, was riddled with thousands of technical errors. Objections were also raised by the Jewish readership, based on the fact that the very first printing of the Mikra'ot Gedolot was edited by [[Felix Pratensis]], a Jew converted to Christianity. Furthermore, Bomberg, a Christian, had requested an ''imprimatur'' from the Pope. Such facts were not compatible with the supposed Jewish nature of the work; Bomberg had to produce a fresh edition under the direction of acceptable Jewish editors. Nevertheless, this first edition served as the textual model for nearly all later editions until modern times. With regard to the Biblical text, many of Ben Hayyim's errors were later corrected by [[Menahem Lonzano]] and [[Jedidiah Norzi|Shlomo Yedidiah Norzi]].

The Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim served as the [[textus receptus]] for the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in 1611 and the Spanish [[Reina-Valera]] translation.

==Recent printed editions==

Most editions until the last few decades, and many editions even today, are reprints of or based on late nineteenth century Eastern European editions, which are in turn based more or less on the Ben Hayyim edition described above.

In the last generation fresh editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been published, based directly on manuscript evidence, principally the ''[[Aleppo Codex|Keter Aram Tzova]]'', the manuscript of the Tanakh kept by the Jews of Aleppo.  These also have improved texts of the commentaries based on ancient manuscripts.  Three of these editions are:
* the [[Bar Ilan University|Bar Ilan]] ''Mikraot Gedolot ha-Keter'', ed. Menaḥem Cohen (18 volumes published of 22 planned: Genesis (2 vols.), Exodus (2 vols.), Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua &amp; Judges (1 vol.), Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Minor Prophets, Psalms (2 vols.), Five Megillot (1 vol.)), Chronicles. 
* ''Torat Hayim'', published by Mosad ha-Rav Kook (15 vols: Torah, Psalms, Proverbs, and five Megillot).
* Chorev Mikraot Gedolot, published by Hotzaat Chorev (Torah only).

'''Musica poetica''' was a term commonly applied to the art of composing music in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century German schools and universities. Its first known use was in the ''Rudimenta Musicae Planae'' (Wittenberg: 1533) of Nicolaus Listenius. Previously, music had been divided into [[musica theoretica]] and [[musica practica]], which were categorised with the [[quadrivium]] and [[trivium (education)|trivium]], respectively. Since music of the time primarily meant vocal music, it was natural for theorists to make analogies between the composition of music and the composition of [[Eloquence|oratory]] or poetry. Hence, the term ''musica poetica''.

Analogies between music and the rhetorical arts were made on several levels. [[Gallus Dressler]] (1563) suggested to liken the structure of a musical composition with that of a speech, as outlined in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] sources, dividing it into such sections as [[exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], [[medium (rhetoric)|medium]] and finis (literally, "beginning", "middle" and "end"). Another kind of analogy was to liken the rules or [[grammar]] of composition with those of speech, as illustrated by [[Joachim Burmeister]]'s use of ''tautoëpia'' to  label consecutive fifths and octaves (which were generally regarded as illegal except in special circumstances). 

Most significantly, though, special melodic, harmonic, or technical devices in music began to be associated with the figures of [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] oratory: for example, a rising or falling [[sequence]] in music was usually called climax in the literature of ''musica poetica''. However, it must be pointed out that such analogies were not always direct: terms used in ''musica poetica'' do not always correspond equivalently to their rhetorical counterparts (for example, in oratory, ''anaphora'' means a straightforward repetition of a word, but in music it can denote various kinds of repetitive device, such as the development of a subject through imitation ([[fugue]]); also, the presence of a rhetorical figure in the text being set to music did not imply an automatic application of that figure's musical equivalent (that is, it was never mandatory for composers to respond to such verbal ideas as "going up" with rising musical phrases (known as ''anabasis'' or ''ascensus'' in ''musica poetica''). 

A knowledge of both Classical rhetoric and ''musica poetica'' can greatly enhance the listener's understanding and appreciation of works composed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially by such figures as [[Heinrich Schütz]] and [[Giacomo Carissimi]]. However, it is also important not to seek examples of musical figures on every page; while rhetoric and musical theory were strongly associated, the nature of this association was complex and variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6520">'''The National Public Health Institute of Finland''' ('''KTL''', {{lang-fi|Kansanterveyslaitos}}, {{lang-sv|Folkhälsoinstitutet}}) was a research and expert institute under the [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]] charged with the task of protecting and promoting health in [[Finland]]. KTL was founded in 1911;&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Härö and V. Raunio: Seerumit aseina - vastustajina mikrobit (Sera as weapons against microbes); History of National Public Health Institute and its predecessors. Helsinki 1990 (in Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt; the final form was established in 1982 in order to promote public health in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Act on the National Public Health Institute 828/1982, section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution had a duty to promote [[health]] and prevent disease. KTL performed research in public health in broad sense, and monitored diseases. KTL also acquired and distributed the vaccines paid by the government.

KTL was merged on 1 January 2009 with STAKES, the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health, to form a new research and development institute, the [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Finland|National Institute for Health and Welfare]] (THL). The last Director General of KTL was [[Pekka Puska]], who was also appointed Director General of the THL.

==History==

Initially the institute was founded to combat infectious diseases and to make and distribute serum preparations and vaccines. The early organisations were the State Serum Laboratory (1911–1947; provisional 1911–1914), the State Serum Institute (1947–1970) and the Public Health Laboratory (1970–1981). The new Act in 1982 paved way for its transformation from a practical microbiological and clinical chemistry laboratory towards a research institute specializing in public health and prevention of diseases. This development was also seen in the organisation structure; new departments in [[Epidemiology]] and [[Environmental Health]] (originally Toxicology and Environmental Hygiene) were founded. In less than 10 years the transformation led by director general [[Jussi Huttunen]] was complete, and the Institute had few routine tasks. It served the government as an expert organisation, performing internationally relevant research related to public health.

==Highlights of research at KTL==

Top quality research at KTL included early work on [[interferons]] by Kari Cantell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074025,00.html Cantell]&lt;/ref&gt; research on several bacterial [[vaccine]]s by Pirjo Mäkelä's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20030212xx1 Mäkelä]&lt;/ref&gt; group, and collaboration with the [[World Health Organization]] to promote vaccination programs in developing countries. In epidemiology and health promotion so called North Karelia Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/731beafd-b544-42b2-b853-baa87db6a046 North Karelia Project]&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Pekka Puska]] produced internationally well-known results in preventing cardiovascular diseases. Later several environmental health projects mostly funded by the [[European Commission]] added to international understanding of toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/dioxin Dioxins]&lt;/ref&gt; in food, and outdoor [[Environmental Health|fine particulate matter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktl.fi/expolis/index.php?id=14&lt;/ Expolis ]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as health problems due to [[Environmental Health|indoor air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566220/pdf/envhper00520-0125.pdf | pmc=1566220 | pmid=10347001 | volume=107 Suppl 3 | title=The Health Protection Act, national guidelines for indoor air quality and development of the national indoor air programs in Finland | author=Husman TM | journal=Environ Health Perspect | pages=515–7 | doi=10.1289/ehp.99107s3515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, mainly in 1990s, genes involved in Finnish heritage of diseases were successfully identified in [[Leena Peltonen-Palotie]]'s group. KTL ranked very high among the Finnish research institutes, and was evaluated to do highly competitive and internationally relevant research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aka.fi/globalassets/awanhat/documents/tiedostot/julkaisut/9_95-ktl-evaluaatio-95.pdf Evaluation of the National Public Health Institute of Finland -Kansanterveyslaitos]&lt;/ref&gt; Complete lists of publications are available.&lt;ref&gt;http://julkari.fi/handle/10024/60359&lt;/ref&gt;

==External funding==

External funding covered approximately 40% of all of the Institute's costs. The most important funding agencies included the Academy of Finland, National Institutes of Health (USA), and the Framework Programs of the European Commission. KTL's policy was to secure as much external funding as possible to guarantee the implementation of its action plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktl.fi/attachments/suomi/julkaisut/julkaisusarja_b/2006/2006b4.pdf GOOD RESEARCH PRACTICE IN THE NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE B4/2006]&lt;/ref&gt; KTL also did research with private funds in the fields of vaccines and nutrition.
Private funding has drawn criticism from some NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rokotusinfo.fi/yhd/tiedotteet/tiedote_050601_html (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imetys.fi/itu/english/findiapress.html Breastfeeding Support Association in Finland: Informed consent missing in infant formula study in Finland - public health policy issues regarding commercial interests]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Government and funding agencies have recommended increased collaboration with companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Asiakirjat/INDICA_verkkosivut.pdf Working group appointed by the Academy of Finland, 2005: Long-term and dynamic partnerships.

The '''Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology''' is a Polish scientific research organization and a part of [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] headquartered in [[Warsaw]], Poland. Founded in 1918, it is a leading institution in the country in the field of [[neurobiology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[biochemistry]].

== About the Institute ==
The Institute comprises laboratories and equipment for, amongst others, [[confocal microscopy]], electron microscopy, scanning and flow cytometry, magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiology, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Currently, the Institute is home to 40 laboratories organised into 4 departments, as well as 6 core facility laboratories forming the Neurobiology Center established in 2013.

The Institute's scientific teams conduct research in neurobiology, neurophysiology, and molecular biology. The experiments are interdisciplinary in character. The research concentrates on systems of varying complexity, from whole organisms through tissues, individual cells, cellular organelles to proteins and genes. The research topics often concentrate on determining signalling pathways whose disruption leads to the development of disease.

As of January 1, 2014 the Nencki Institute has once again become the owner of the Mikołajki Research Station [1]. The Station is the site of research in the areas of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem ecology, and environmental monitoring.

The Station/Institute is empowered to bestow [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and DSc doctoral degrees.

The laboratories of the Nencki Institute are organised into 4 separate Departments: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell
Neurobiology, and Neurophysiology. There are also 6 other laboratories that constitute the Neurobiology Center.

The research conducted in the Departments of Neurophysiology and Molecular and Cell Neurobiology mainly deals with the cognitive functions of the Brain. The dominant theme is the plasticity of the nervous system under normal and pathological conditions. We study the effects of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, epileptogenesis and the consequences of re-innervation, as well as emotional disturbances in humans.

The research at the Department of Cell Biology is chiefly directed towards elucidating signalling cascades and regulatory
mechanisms of gene expression involved in tumour transformation and the immune response, including the participation of membrane lipids in signal transfer by immunoreceptors, as well as the genetic regulation of cytoskeletal reorganisation.

The Department of Biochemistry concentrates its research efforts on describing the molecular mechanisms of lipid-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the regulation of calcium-mediated signal pathways,  kinesine functioning, the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the development of pathologies, as well as the elucidation of the structure and function of intracellular ion channels.

The Neurobiology Center conducts interdisciplinary basic research (based on, for example, brain imaging, animal modeling, or bioinformatics) as well as research on novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods in relation to the nervous system. This work is conducted in collaboration with many Warsaw institutes and universities as part of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme
project entitled "Centre for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT 2007-2013” - but also with research facilities around the world.

== Early history ==

It was founded in 1918/19, shortly after the reestablishment of Poland as an independent country. It was based on three pre-existing laboratories affiliated with the Scientific Society of Warsaw (Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie): Laboratory of Neurobiology (in existence since 1911), Laboratory of Physiology (in existence since 1913) and Laboratory of General Biology (established in 1918). Formation and development of the Institute was supported in part by a donation of Nadine Sieber-Shumova, a close co-worker of [[Marceli Nencki]] from Berne and St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;(1994). [http://www.ane.pl/pdf/5420.pdf 75th ANNIVERSARY of the NENCKI INSTITUTE OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY]. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. , 54: 163-200&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades the Institute gained prominence in the field of biological research in Poland.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} One of its major figures was the neurophysiologist [[Jerzy Konorski]] who discovered [[operant conditioning|secondary conditioned reflexes]]. The outbreak of [[World War II]] interrupted a period of its intensive expansion in the field of experimental biology, over a dozen of the Institute's staff lost their lives, and its premises (including most of its 30,000-volume library) was destroyed.

== Post World War II ==

The surviving staff members (professors Jan Dembowski, Jerzy Konorski, and Włodzimierz Niemierko) re-established the Nencki Institute. In 1952 the Institute was incorporated into the newly founded [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], and the Institute's director, Prof. Dembowski, became the first President of the Academy. During the period  1953-55, a newly erected building at 3 Pasteur Street in Warsaw became the new home of the Nencki Institute.

== Recent developments ==

In 1990, the Institute was invited to become a member institution of the Global Network for [[Molecular and Cell Biology]] (MCBN) within [[UNESCO]]. The Institute hires new researchers and awards approximately 15 doctoral degrees annually and is competitive in securing external funding for research projects. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Two European Centres of Excellence were recently formed within the Institute. The Institute has a PhD programme shared with the [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]].

== Structure of the Institute ==

The departments within the Institute are:

* Department of Cell Biology
* Department of Biochemistry
* Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology
* Department of Neurophysiology
* Neurobiology Center

The Institute has also state of the art cytometry laboratory, animal house, electron microscopy core facility, informatics laboratory, and on-site library.

== Notable academics ==
Some researchers from Nencki Institute are among the leading Polish academics.

Newberry College has a diverse line-up in men's and women's sports including baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. The college is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and the [[South Atlantic Conference]] (SAC). The school is famous for being on the losing end of a tilt against Furman University, in which Frank Selvy scored 100 points.

==Music program==
The music program at Newberry College has a history in vocal and instrumental performance dating back over 100 years, and a jazz band and marching band in existence since 1956. In 1956, a major turning point in the school's musical history took place, when respected military band leader and alumnus Charles "Chief" Pruitt organized the jazz band and the marching band after returning to the school to teach music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pruitt Obituary|url=http://genealogytrails.com/scar/newberry/pobits.htm|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newberry College marching band, which has been in existence since that time, is one of the most unusual aspects of Newberry College's music program. Newberry is one of the smallest colleges in the country with a marching band, and it is the only Lutheran school in the country with a marching band.

Also in 1956, Pruitt hosted the first jazz festival at Newberry College. This jazz festival has since become a unique annual tradition at Newberry College, and is considered to be the second oldest jazz festival in the nation.

==V-12: Navy College Training Program==
In 1943, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox announced the start of a new college training program, the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]]. The program was designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Newberry College became one of 131 colleges and universities in the United States chosen to participate in the V-12 program.

On July 1, 1943, the first 325 cadets arrived on campus; they included both V-12 Cadets and V-5 Aviation Cadets.

The cadets attended classes for periods of one to six terms of 16 weeks. Work was planned so that each term was the equivalent of a normal college semester. The [[Navy]] handled the discipline of its cadets, directed the physical fitness program, provided military drills and cooperated with the College in the direction of the program.

During the 27 months the V-12 Program were a part of the college, over 1,000 cadets were assigned to Newberry. On October 31, 1945, the V-12 Unit was decommissioned and Newberry College returned to its civilian status.

==US Air Force ROTC Program==

From 1972 until 1976, the United States Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Detachment 777) was established at Newberry.  Through this program, selected students were commissioned as second lieutenants in the USAF and many served distinguished careers in the service of their nation.  In addition to Det. 777, an Arnold Air Society and an Angel Flight program was also active during this period.

Due to the manning authorization of the Air Force following the Vietnam War, Detachment 777 of Newberry College was deactivated.

== History ==
[[Image:X10 Reactor Face.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Workers in 1943 loading uranium slugs into the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] (now a National Historic Landmark)]]

The town of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] was established by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] as part of the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in 1942 on isolated farm land as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name=bigproblems&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
During the war, advanced research for the government was managed at the site by the [[University of Chicago]].  In 1943, construction of the "Clinton Laboratories" was completed, later renamed to "Oak Ridge National Laboratory".&lt;ref name=bigproblems/&gt;  The site was chosen for the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], used to show that [[plutonium]] can be created from [[enriched uranium]].  [[Enrico Fermi]] and his colleagues developed the world's second self-sustaining [[nuclear reactor]] after Fermi's previous experiment, the [[Chicago Pile-1]].  The X-10 was the first reactor designed for continuous operation.&lt;ref name=x10&gt;

[[File:MSRE Core.JPG|thumb|The core of the [[Molten Salt Reactor Experiment]]]]

In 1950 the [[Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology]] was established with two courses in reactor operation and safety; almost 1000 students graduated.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  Much of the research performed at ORNL in the 1950s was relating to nuclear reactors as a form of energy production, both for propulsion and electricity.  More reactors were built in the 1950s than in the rest of the ORNL's history combined.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Another project was the world's first [[light water reactor]].  With its principles of neutron moderation and fuel cooling by ordinary water, it is the direct ancestor of most modern nuclear power stations.  The [[United States Armed Forces|US Military]] funded much of its development, for [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered submarines and ships]] of the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The [[US Army]] contracted portable nuclear reactors in 1953 for heat and electricity generation in remote military bases.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The reactors were designed at ORNL, produced by [[American Locomotive Company]] and used in [[Greenland]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) also contributed funding to three reactors, the lab's first computers, and its first particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  ORNL designed and tested a nuclear-powered aircraft in 1954 as a proof-of-concept for a proposed USAF fleet of long-range bombers, although it never flew.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

The provision of [[radionuclide]]s by X-10 for medicine grew steadily in the 1950s with more isotopes available.  ORNL was the only Western source of [[californium-252]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt; ORNL scientists lowered the [[immune system]]s of mice and performed the world's first successful [[bone marrow transplant]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In the early 1960s there was a large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered [[desalination]] plants, where deserts met the sea, to provide water. The project, called Water for Peace, was backed by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and presented at a 1964 United Nations conference, but increases in the cost of construction and public confidence in nuclear power falling caused the plan to fail.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;  The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate [[Dosimetry|dosage limits]] and [[dosimeter]]s, and improved radiation shielding.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1964 the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] began with the construction of the reactor. It was operated from 1966 until 1969 (with six months down time to move from [[U-235]] to [[Uranium-233|U-233]] fuel), and proved the viability of [[molten salt reactor]]s, while also producing fuel for other reactors as a byproduct of its own reaction.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] built in 1965 had the highest [[neutron flux]] of any reactor at the time.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  It improved upon the work of the X-10 reactor, producing more medical isotopes, as well as allowing higher fidelity of materials research.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Researchers in the Biology Division studied the effects of chemicals on mice, including [[air pollution|petrol fumes]], [[Health effects of pesticides|pesticides]], and [[Health effects of tobacco|tobacco]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In the late 1960s, cuts in funding led to the cancellation of plans for another particle accelerator, and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] cut the breeder reactor program by two-thirds, leading to a downsizing in staff from 5000 to 3800.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

[[File:ORMAK.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of ORMAK, an early [[tokamak]], was gold plated for reflectivity]]

In the 1970s, the prospect of [[fusion power]] was strongly considered, sparking research at ORNL.  A [[tokamak]] called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first tokamak to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  After the success of the fusion experiments, it was enlarged and renamed ORMAK II in 1973; however, the experiments ultimately failed to lead to fusion power plants.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The US Atomic Energy Commission required improved safety standards in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors, so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance.  In 1972 the AEC held a series of public hearings where emergency cooling requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

ORNL was involved in analysing the damage to the core of the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] after the [[Three Mile Island accident|accident in 1979]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Also in 1972, [[Peter Mazur (biologist)|Peter Mazur]], a biologist at ORNL, froze with [[liquid nitrogen]], thawed and implanted mouse [[embryo]]s in a [[surrogate mother]].  The mouse pups were born healthy.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  The technique is popular in the livestock industry, as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus, through [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]], have many more offspring than would naturally be possible.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1974 Alvin Weinberg, director of the lab for 19 years, was replaced by [[Herman Postma]], a fusion scientist.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1977 construction began for 6&amp;nbsp;metre (20&amp;nbsp;foot) [[superconductor|superconducting]] [[electromagnet]]s, intended to control fusion reactions.  The project was an international effort: three electromagnets were produced in the US, one in Japan, one in [[Switzerland]] and the final by remaining European states.  Experimentation continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The 1980s brought more changes to ORNL: a focus on efficiency became paramount.

An accelerated climate simulation chamber was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  Materials research into heat resistant [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]] for use in truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research that began in the nuclear reactors of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established, where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects.  The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policy]] of less government expenditure.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1981, the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility, a 25&amp;nbsp;MV particle accelerator, was opened at ORNL.  At the time, Holifield had the widest range of ion species and was twice as powerful as other accelerators, attracting hundreds of guest researchers each year.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The Department of Energy was concerned with the pollution surrounding ORNL and it began clean-up efforts.  Burial trenches and leaking pipes had contaminated the groundwater beneath the lab, and radiation tanks were sitting idle, full of waste.  Estimates of the total cost of clean-up were into the hundreds of millions of US dollars.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The five older reactors were subjected to safety reviews in 1987, ordered to be deactivated until the reviews were complete.  By 1989 when the High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted the US supply of certain medical isotopes was depleted.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1989 the former executive officer of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[Alvin Trivelpiece]], became director of ORNL; he remained in the role until 2000.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1992, a [[whistleblower]], Charles Varnadore, filed complaints against ORNL, alleging safety violations and retaliation by his superiors.  While an administrative law judge ruled in Varnadore's favor, the Secretary of Labor, [[Robert Reich]], overturned that ruling.  However, Varnadore's case saw prime contractor [[Martin Marietta]] cited for safety violations, and ultimately led to additional whistleblower protection within DOE.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas, Charles Varnadore, whistleblower at lab, dies at 71, [[New York Times]], August 5, 2013, p.B8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===

Housing built at Oak Ridge was located at "Townsite," along with stores and other necessary buildings.  Housing was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]].  There were separate dorms for single men and women, with houses available for marrieds.  The dorms tended to be overcrowded, with "four sinks for forty-two women."&lt;ref name="Believer"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=[[Millicent G Dillon|Dillon]] |first=Millicent G. |date=June 2011 |title=In the Atomic City |magazine=The Believer |location=San Francisco |publisher=McSweeney's }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of Townsite has now been replaced by the modern city of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee#History|Oak Ridge]].

==Areas of research==
ORNL conducts research and development activities that span a wide range of scientific disciplines. Many research areas have a significant overlap with each other; researchers often work in two or more of the fields listed here. The laboratory's major research areas are described briefly below.
* [[Chemistry|Chemical sciences]] – ORNL conducts both fundamental and applied research in a number of areas, including [[catalysis]], [[Surface chemistry|surface science]] and [[surface chemistry|interfacial chemistry]]; molecular transformations and fuel chemistry; heavy element chemistry and radioactive materials characterization; aqueous solution chemistry and [[geochemistry]]; [[mass spectrometry]] and laser spectroscopy; separations chemistry; materials chemistry including synthesis and characterization of [[polymers]] and other soft materials; chemical biosciences; and [[neutron scattering|neutron science]].
* [[Electron microscopy]]  – ORNL's electron microscopy program investigates key issues in [[condensed matter]], [[materials science|materials]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[nanotechnology|nanosciences]].
* [[Nuclear medicine]] – The laboratory's nuclear medicine research is focused on the development of improved reactor production and processing methods to provide medical [[radiopharmacology|radioisotopes]], the development of new radionuclide generator systems, the design and evaluation of new radiopharmaceuticals for applications in nuclear medicine and [[oncology]].
* [[Physics]] – Physics research at ORNL is focused primarily on studies of the fundamental properties of [[matter]] at the [[atom]]ic, [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]], and [[subatomic particle|subnuclear]] levels and the development of experimental devices in support of these studies.
* Population – ORNL provides federal, state and international organizations with a gridded population database, called Landscan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/landscan |title=LandScan Home |publisher=Ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for estimating ambient population. LandScan is a raster image, or grid, of population counts, which provides human population estimates every 30 x 30 arc seconds, which translates roughly to population estimates for 1 kilometer square windows or grid cells at the equator, with cell width decreasing at higher latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;LandScan Home, [http://www.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/ ornl.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Though many population datasets exist, LandScan is the best spatial population dataset, which also covers the globe. Updated annually (although data releases are generally one year behind the current year) offers continuous, updated values of population, based on the most recent information.  Landscan data are accessible through [[GIS]] applications and a [[USAID]] public domain application called Population Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=Populationexplorer.com |publisher=Populationexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
The laboratory has a long history of energy research; nuclear reactor experiments have been conducted since the end of World War II in 1945. Because of the availability of reactors and high-performance computing resources an emphasis on improving the efficiency of nuclear reactors is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel Cycle and Isotopes Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/division_fcid.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rnsd&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/rnsd/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs develop more efficient materials, more accurate simulations of aging reactor cores, sensors and controls as well as safety procedures for regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name=rnsd/&gt;

The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims to improve air quality in the US and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies.&lt;ref name=eetp&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ees/factsheets/fs_eere.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, [[carbon-neutral]] homes by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Areas – Building Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_building.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind &amp; Water Power Program|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_wind_hydro.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geothermal Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_geothermal.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Energy Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_solar.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusion is another area with a history of research at ORNL, dating back to the 1970s. The Fusion Energy Division pursues short-term goals to develop components such as [[high temperature superconductor]]s, high-speed hydrogen pellet injectors and suitable materials for future fusion research.&lt;ref name=ornlfus&gt;{{cite web|title=Fusion Energy Division Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/factsheets/fs_fusion_energy.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fed&gt;{{cite web|title=Fusion Energy Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/division_fed.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much research into the behaviour and maintenance of a plasma takes place at the Fusion Energy Division to further the understanding of [[plasma physics]], a crucial area for developing a fusion power plant.&lt;ref name=ornlfus/&gt;&lt;ref name=fed/&gt; The US [[ITER]] office is at ORNL with partners at [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] and [[Savannah River National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About US ITER|url=https://www.usiter.org/about/|publisher=[[ITER|US ITER]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US contribution to the ITER project is 9.09% which is expected to be in excess of US$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion throughout the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGrath|first=Matt|title=Fusion falters under soaring costs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8103557.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013|date=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITER Procurement Sharing|url=http://www.iter.org/procurementsharing|publisher=[[ITER]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutron science===
There are three [[neutron source]]s at ORNL; the [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR), the [[Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator]] (ORELA) and the [[Spallation Neutron Source]]. HFIR provides neutrons in a stable beam resulting from a constant [[research reactor|nuclear reaction]] whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutrons at ORNL|url=http://neutrons.ornl.gov/about/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORELA&gt;{{cite web|last=Koehler|first=P.

===Materials===
[[File:Cat Regenerator.jpg|thumb|A [[particulate filter]] housing for a [[furnace|regenerative burner]] made of CF8C Plus stainless steel]]
Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducts research into [[materials science]] in a range of areas. Between 2002 and 2008 ORNL partnered with [[Caterpillar Inc.]] (CAT) to form a new material for their diesel engines that can withstand large temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name=CF8C&gt;{{cite web|title=New Steel Advances Engine Exhaust System|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/cf8cplus/pdf/09-G01217_Steel.pdf|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=January 19, 2013|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new steel, named CF8C Plus, is based on conventional CF8C stainless steel with added [[manganese]] and [[nitrogen]]; the result has better high–temperature properties and is easier to cast at a similar cost.&lt;ref name=CF8C/&gt; In 2003 the partners received an R&amp;D 100 award from ''R&amp;D magazine'' and in 2009 received an award for "excellence in technology transfer" from the [[Federal Laboratory Consortium]] for the commercialisation of the steel.&lt;ref name=CF8C/&gt;

There is a high-temperature materials lab at ORNL that permits researchers from universities, private companies and other government initiatives to use their facilities. The lab is available for free if the results are published; private research is permitted but requires payment.&lt;ref name=html&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://www.html.ornl.gov/what.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate lab, the Shared Equipment User Facility, is one of three DOE sponsored facilities with nano-scale microscopy and [[tomography]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared Research User Facility|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/share/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides resources to the US [[Department of Homeland Security]] and other defense programs. The Global Security and Nonproliferation (GS&amp;N) program develops and implements policies, both US based and international, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material.&lt;ref name=GSN&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Security &amp; Nonproliferation Programs Mission Factsheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/adm/directorates/gsd/factsheets/GS&amp;N%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has developed safeguards for nuclear arsenals, guidelines for dismantling arsenals, plans of action should nuclear material fall into unauthorised hands, detection methods for stolen or missing nuclear material and trade of nuclear material between the US and Russia.&lt;ref name=GSN/&gt; The GS&amp;N's work overlaps with that of the Homeland Security Programs Office, providing detection of nuclear material and nonproliferation guidelines.

The '''Operational Street Pollution Model''' ('''OSPM''') is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in so-called street canyons. It was developed by the [[National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark]], Department of Atmospheric Environment, Aarhus University. As a result of reorganisation at Aarhus University the model has been maintained by the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University since 2011. For about 20 years, OSPM has been used in many countries for studying traffic pollution, performing analyses of field campaign measurements, studying efficiency of pollution abatement strategies, carrying out exposure assessments and as reference in comparisons to other models. OSPM is generally considered as state-of-the-art in practical street pollution modelling.

==Description==

[[File:OSPM fig1.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Principle flow in OSPM.|Figure 1: Principal flow pattern inside a street canyon for near perpendicular roof level wind direction and schematic picture of the main processes assumed in ''OSPM''.]]
In OSPM concentrations of traffic-emitted pollution is calculated using a combination of a plume model for the direct contribution and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street.

The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are calculated taking into account NO-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; chemistry and the residence time of pollutants in the street. The model is designed to work with input and output in the form of one-hour averages.

The main principles in the model are depicted in ''Figure 1'' for the case of a wind direction nearly perpendicular to the street canyon. A receptor point in leeward position is affected by the direct plume showing considerably higher concentrations than a receptor in windward position being exposed to the less concentrated recirculating air.

The turbulence produced by the moving traffic (TPT) is acting in addition to the turbulence created by the roof level wind. This leads to a faster dispersion of the direct plume but also to an improved air exchange at roof level between the street canyon and the background air.

'''Passion''' (Greek ''πασχω'' "to suffer, to be acted on"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|title=3958. paschó|work=Strong's Concordance|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718232618/http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Late Latin (chiefly Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|title=Definition of passion|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504214510/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|archivedate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''passio'' "passion; suffering" (from Latin ''pati'' "to suffer")) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term ''[[lust]]''.

[[Denis Diderot]] describes passions as "penchants, inclinations, desires and aversions carried to a certain degree of intensity, combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain, occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits, are what we call passions. They can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom, a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive; whence the name passions. This inclination or so-called disposition of the soul, is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.248|title=Passions|first=Denis |last=Diderot|date=1 April 2004|journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project|volume=12|page=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further breaks down pleasure and pain, which are the guiding principles of passion into four major categories:

# Pleasures and pains of the senses 
# Pleasures of the mind or of the imagination 
# Our perfection or our imperfection of virtues or vices 
# Pleasures and pains in the happiness or misfortunes of others

==Reason==

'''Strong Desire for something:''' 
In whatever context, if someone desires for something and that desire has some strong feeling or emotion is defined in terms of passion. Passion has no boundary, being passionate about something which is boundless can be sometimes dangerous, In which person forget about everything and is fully determined towards the particular thing-'''(Sanyukta)'''

In his wake, [[Stoicism|Stoics]] like [[Epictetus]] emphasized that "the most important and especially pressing field of study is that which has to do with the stronger emotions...sorrows, lamentations, envies...passions which make it impossible for us even to listen to reason".&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Oldfield trans., ''Epitectus: The Discourses Vol II''  (london 1978) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoic tradition still lay behind [[Hamlet]]'s plea to "Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core",&lt;ref&gt;Harold Jenkins ed., ''Hamlet'' (London 1995) p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Erasmus]]'s lament that "Jupiter has bestowed far more passion than reason&amp;nbsp;– you could calculate the ratio as 24 to one".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goleman, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was only with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] that a valorisation of passion ''over'' reason took hold in the Western tradition: "the more Passion there is, the better the Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;John Dennis, in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford 1953) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent concerns of emotional intelligence have been to find a synthesis of the two forces—something that "turns the old understanding of the tension between reason and feeling on its head: it is not that we want to do away with emotion and put reason in its place, as Erasmus had it, but instead find the intelligent balance of the two".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Descartes' Error"===
[[Antonio Damasio]] studied what ensued when something "severed ties between the lower centres of the emotional brain...and the thinking abilities of the [[neocortex]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He found that while "emotions and feelings can cause havoc in the processes of reasoning...the ''absence'' of emotion and feeling is no less damaging";&lt;ref&gt;Antonio R. Damasio, ''Descartes' Error'' (London 1996) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and was led to "the counter-intuitive position that feelings are typically ''indispensable'' for rational decisions".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The passions, he concluded, "have a say on how the rest of the brain and cognition go about their business. Their influence is immense...[providing] a frame of reference&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to [[Descartes]]' error...the Cartesian idea of a disembodied mind".&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, p. 160 and p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marriage==

A tension or [[dialectic]] between marriage and passion can be traced back in Western society at least as far as the Middle Ages, and the emergence of the cult of [[courtly love]]. [[Denis de Rougemont]] has argued that 'since its origins in the twelfth century, passionate love was constituted in opposition to marriage'.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougement, ''Love in the Western World'' (Princeton 1983) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacey Oliker]] writes that while "[[Puritanism]] prepared the ground for a marital love ideology by prescribing love in marriage", only from the eighteenth century has "romantic love ideology resolved the Puritan antagonism between passion and reason"&lt;ref&gt;Stacey J. Oliker, ''Best Friends and Marriage'' (1989) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; in a marital context. (Note though that [[Saint Paul]] spoke of loving one's wife in [[Ephesians]] 5.)

==Intellectual passions==

[[George Bernard Shaw]] "insists that there are passions far more exciting than the physical ones...'intellectual passion, mathematical passion, passion for discovery and exploration: the mightiest of all passions'".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Shaw's People'' (1996) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, [[Sigmund Freud]], argued for a continuity (not a contrast) between the two, physical and intellectual, and commended the way "[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] had energetically sublimated his sexual passions into the passion for independent scientific research".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation in an occupation==
There are different reasons individuals are [[Motivation|motivated]] for an [[Job (role)|occupation]]. One of these includes passion for the occupation. When an individual is passionate about their occupation they tend to be less obsessive about their behavior while on their job, resulting in more work being done and more work satisfaction. These same individuals have higher levels of [[psychological]] well-being.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=R. J.|author2=Fiksenbaum, Lisa|title=Work Motivations, Satisfactions, and Health Among Managers: Passion Versus Addiction|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=May 2009|volume=43|pages=349–365|doi=10.1177/1069397109336990|url=http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812093750/http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|archivedate=2016-08-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people genuinely enjoy their profession and are motivated by their passion, they tend to be more satisfied with their work and more psychologically healthy. When individuals are unsatisfied with their profession they tend to also be dissatisfied with their family relationships and experience psychological distress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Other reasons people are more satisfied when they are motivated by their passion for their occupation include the effects of intrinsic and external motivations. When an individual is doing the job to satisfy others, they tend to have lower levels of satisfaction and psychological health. Also, these same individuals have shown they are motivated by several beliefs and fears concerning other people.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Thirdly, though some individuals believe one should not work extreme hours, many prefer it because of how passionate they are about the occupation. On the other hand, this may also put a strain on family relationships and friendships. The balance of the two is something that is hard to achieve and it is always hard to satisfy both parties.

===Work enjoyment vs. inner pressures===
There are different components that qualify as reasons for considering an individual as a [[workaholic]]. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Spence and Robbins (1992) by stating two of the three workaholism components that are used to measure workaholism.  These include feeling driven to work because of inner pressure and work enjoyment.  Both of these affect an individual differently and each has different outcomes.  To begin, work enjoyment brings about more positive work outcomes and is unrelated to health indicators. Inner pressure, on the other hand, is negatively related with work outcomes and has been related negatively to measures of psychological health. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum make a reference to Graves et al. (2006) when examining work enjoyment and inner pressures. Work enjoyment and inner pressure were tested with performance ratings. The former was positively related to performance ratings while the latter interfered with the performance-enhancing aspects of work enjoyment. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Virick and Baruch (2007) when explaining how these two workaholism components affect [[life satisfaction]]. Not surprisingly, inner pressure lowered the balance between work-life and life satisfaction but enhanced people's performance at their occupation, whereas work enjoyment led to a positive balance between the two. Again, when individuals are passionate about their occupation and put in many hours, they then become concerned that their occupation will satisfy personal relationships and the balance must then be found according to the importance levels of the individual.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Motivation and outcomes====
The researchers indicate different patterns of correlations between these two components. These patterns include antecedents and consequences. The two components offer unique motivations or orientations to work which result in its effects on work and well-being. Inner pressures will hinder performance while work enjoyment will smooth performance.  Inner pressures of workaholism have characteristics such as persistence, rigidity, perfectionism, and heightened levels of job stress. This component is also associated with working harder, not smarter.  On a more positive note, individuals who enjoy their work will have higher levels of performance for several reasons. These include creativity, trust in their colleagues, and reducing levels of stress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Good and bad workaholics====
Burke and Fiksenbaum refer to Schaufeli, Taris, and Bakker (2007) when they made a distinction between an individual being a good workaholic and him being a bad workaholic. A good workaholic will score higher on measures of work engagement and a bad workaholic will score higher on measures of burnout. They also suggest why this is – some individuals work because they are satisfied, engaged, and challenged and to prove a point. On the other hand, the opposite kind work hard because they are addicted to work; they see that the occupation makes a contribution to finding an identity and purpose.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Desire in an occupation====
Passion and desire go hand in hand, especially as a motivation. Linstead &amp; Brewis refer to Merriam-Webster to say that passion is an "intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or conviction". This suggests that passion is a very intense emotion, but can be positive or negative. Negatively, it may be unpleasant at times. It could involve pain and has obsessive forms that can destroy the self and even others. In an occupation, when an individual is very passionate about their job, they may be so wrapped up in work that they cause pain to their loved ones by focusing more on their job than on their friendships and relationships. This is a constant battle of balance that is difficult to achieve and only an individual can decide where that line lies. Passion is connected to the concept of desire. In fact, they are inseparable, according to a mostly western way of thinking related to Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine. These two concepts cause individuals to reach out for something, or even someone. They both can either be creative or destructive and this dark side can very well be dangerous to the self or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linstead|first=S.|author2=Brewis, J.|title=Passion, Knowledge and Motivation: Ontolgies of Desire|journal=Organization|year=2007|volume=14|series=3|pages=351–371|doi=10.1177/1350508407076149|url=http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210041556/http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation for hobbies==
[[Hobbies]] require a certain level of passion in order to continue engaging in the hobby. Singers, athletes, dancers, artists, and many others describe their emotion for their hobby as a passion. Although this might be the emotion they're feeling, passion is serving as a motivation for them to continue their hobby. Recently there has been a model to explain different types of passion that contribute to engaging in an activity.

=== Dualistic model ===
According to researchers who have tested this model, "A dualistic model in which passion is defined as a strong inclination or desire toward a self-defining activity that one likes (or even loves), that one finds important (high valuation), and in which one invests time and energy." &lt;ref name="Mediating"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipe|first=F.L.|author2=Vallerand, R. J. |author3=Houlfort, N. |author4=Lavigne, G. L. |author5=Donahue, E. G. |title=Passion for an activity and quality of interpersonal relationships: The mediating role of emotions.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=98|issue=6|pages=917–932 |doi=10.1037/a0018017 |pmid=20515247}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that there exist two types of passion. The first type of passion is harmonious passion.

"A harmonious passion refers to a strong desire to engage in the activity that remains under the person's control." &lt;ref name="Mediating"/&gt;This is mostly obtained when the person views their activity as part of their [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. Furthermore, once an activity is part of the person's identity then the motivation to continue the specific hobby is even stronger. The harmony obtained with this passion is conceived when the person is able both to freely engage in or to stop the hobby. It's not so much that the person is forced to continue this hobby, but on his or her own [[free will]] is able to engage in it. For example, if a girl loves to play [[volleyball]], but she has a project due the next day and her friends invite her to play, she should be able to say "no" on the basis of her own free will.

The second kind of passion in the dualistic model is ''obsessive passion''. Being the opposite of ''harmonious passion''. This type has a strong desire to engage in the activity, but it's not under the person's own control and he or she is forced to engage in the hobby. This type of passion has a negative effect on a person where they could feel they need to engage in their hobby to continue, for example,  interpersonal relationships, or "fit in" with the crowd. To change the above example, if the girl has an obsessive passion towards volleyball and she is asked to play with her friends, she will likely say "yes" even though she needs to finish her project for the next day.

==== Intrinsic motivation ====
Since passion can be a type of motivation in hobbies then assessing intrinsic motivation is appropriate. Intrinsic motivation helps define these types of passion. Passion naturally helps the needs or desires that motivate a person to some particular action or behavior.&lt;ref name="RobinKeys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=C.|title=The Keys to Turbo-Charging Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Journal For Quality &amp; Participation|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain abilities and hobbies can be developed early and the innate motivation is also something that comes early in life. Although someone might know how to engage in a hobby, this doesn't necessarily mean they are motivated to do it. Christine Robinson makes the point in her article that, " ...knowledge of your innate motivation can help guide action toward what will be fulfilling." &lt;ref name="RobinKeys"/&gt; Feeling satisfied and fulfilled builds the passion for the hobby to continue a person's happiness.

==Fictional examples==

In [[Margaret Drabble]]'s ''[[The Realms of Gold]]'', the hero flies hundreds of miles to reunite with the heroine, only to miss her by 24 hours&amp;nbsp;– leaving the onlookers "wondering what grand passion could have brought him so far...a quixotic look about him, a look of harassed desperation".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''The Realms of Gold''(Penguin 1977) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple ''do'' finally reunite, however, the heroine is less than impressed. "'If you ask me, it was a very ''childish'' gesture. You're not twenty-one now, you know'. 'No, I know. It was my last fling'".&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s ''1934'', the revolutionary double-agent, faced with the girl he is betraying, "was seized by violent desire...he never took his eyes off my bosom...I believe those two dark spots at the end of my breasts were enough to make him forget tsarism, revolution, political faith, ideology, and betrayal".&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Moravia, ''1934'' (London 1983) p. 128-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early years ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Farmer's High School and Old Main.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main c. 1855]]
The school was founded as a degree-granting institution on February 22, 1855, by act P.L. 46, No. 50 of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as the '''[[Farmers' High School]] of Pennsylvania'''. [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], Pennsylvania, became the home of the new school when [[James Irvin]] of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], Pennsylvania, donated {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} of land{{spaced ndash}}the first of {{convert|10101|acre|km2|0}} the school would eventually acquire. In 1862, the school's name was changed to the '''Agricultural College of Pennsylvania''', and with the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], Pennsylvania selected the school in 1863 to be the state's sole [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] college. The school's name changed to the '''Pennsylvania State College''' in 1874; enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates the following year as the school tried to balance purely [[Agricultural science|agricultural studies]] with a more classic education.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in 1882, and broadened the curriculum. Shortly after he introduced [[Engineering|engineering studies]], Penn State became one of the ten largest engineering schools in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Of Mechanical Engineering – Chapter 1: 1886–1907 (L. E. Reber) |publisher=Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical &amp; Nuclear Engineering |url=http://www.mne.psu.edu/History/chapter1.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104200643/http://www.mne.psu.edu/History/chapter1.html |archivedate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton also expanded the [[liberal arts]] and agriculture programs, for which the school began receiving regular appropriations from the state in 1887.&lt;ref name=atherton&gt;{{cite web|title=George W.

Additionally, Penn State's [[Atherton Hall (Penn State)|Atherton Hall]], a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, is named not after George Atherton himself, but after his wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.&lt;ref name="intercom_atherton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Descendants of Atherton and Buckhout Discover Their Roots at University Park|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Oct10/atherton.html|work=Penn State Intercom, October 10, 2002 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is in front of Schwab Auditorium near [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], marked by an engraved [[marble]] block in front of his statue.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the years that followed, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the state's largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in 1936.&lt;ref name="history_short"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania State University – Mission and Public Character|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/historyshort.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President [[Ralph Dorn Hetzel]] to provide an alternative for [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

In 1953, President [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status as '''The Pennsylvania State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bezilla|first1=Michael|title=Penn State: An Illustrated History|date=1985|publisher=Pennsylvania State university Press |isbn=0-271-00392-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his successor [[Eric A. Walker (engineer)|Eric A. Walker]] (1956–1970), the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt; In addition, in 1967, the [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]], a college of medicine and hospital, was established in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] with a $50&amp;nbsp;million gift from the [[Hershey Trust Company]].&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;
{{wide image|PennStateCollege 1922.tif|800px|Students sit outside Pennsylvania State College (c.1922)|35%|right |alt=Students sit outside Pennsylvania State College (c.1922)}}

=== Modern era ===
In the 1970s, the university became a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. In 1975, the lyrics in Penn State's alma mater song were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of [[International Women's Year]]; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously-published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee, and Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/almamater.html|title=For The Glory of Old State|website=psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Penn State child sex abuse scandal}}

In 2011, the university and its football team garnered major international media attention and criticism due to a [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|sex abuse scandal]] in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of [[child sexual abuse]] by former football team defensive coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]]. Athletic director [[Timothy Curley]] and Gary Schultz, Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, were indicted for perjury. In the wake of the scandal, coach [[Joe Paterno]] was fired&lt;ref name=BG01&gt;[[Dan Shaughnessy|Shaughnessy, Dan]] (November 10, 2011).

A subcommittee of the Board of Trustees engaged former [[FBI]] director [[Louis Freeh]] to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, announcing that Paterno, along with Spanier, Curley and Schultz "conceal[ed] Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities" and "failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade".&lt;ref name=FreehReport&gt;[http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/other/REPORT_FINAL_071212.pdf Report of the Special Investigative Counsel Regarding the Pennsylvania State University Related to the Child Sexual Abuse Committed by Gerald A.

The [[NCAA]] penalized Penn State football with a $60 million fine, a ban from bowl games and post-season play for 4 years, a reduction in [[scholarship]]s from 25 to 15 per year for four years, the vacating of all wins from 1998 to 2011 and a 5-year probationary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA: Penn State Gets 4-Year Bowl Ban, Must Vacate Wins From 1998–2011|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/07/23/penn-state-sanctions-from-ncaa-in-wake-of-freeh-report/ |publisher=CBS News New York|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who was retained by the Paterno family to review the Freeh report,&lt;ref name="usatoday2013" /&gt; concluded that the report that placed so much blame on Penn State and Paterno was a "rush to injustice" that could not be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thinktank/Penn-State-release-Freeh-report-documents.html|title=Thornburgh: Penn State, release Freeh report documents|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that not only did the evidence "fall far short" of showing Paterno attempted to conceal the Sandusky scandal, but rather that "the contrary is true".&lt;ref name="usatoday2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/02/11/paterno-report-thornburgh/1910529/|author=Dick Thornburgh|title=Freeh hastily misjudged Paterno: Column |work=USA Today |publisher=ESPN |date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, state Sen.

Transportation access:

The University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of [[Interstate 99]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], and is due south of [[Interstate 80]]. Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the [[Lock Haven, PA|Lock Haven]] – [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] branch line of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher T.|last=Baer|title=Named Trains of the PRR including Through Services|year=2009|url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf|format=PDF|website=prrths.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the nearest passenger rail access is in [[Lewistown, PA|Lewistown]], 31 miles to the southeast. The [[University Park Airport]], serving four [[regional airlines]], is near University Park.

== Organization and administration ==
Penn State is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="state approps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |title=Spanier Testifies for More Funding |last=Horan |first=Kevin |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041834/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports concerning the 2007–2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.&lt;ref name="approps 0708"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |title=Penn State To Receive Increased Appropriations |last=Boyer |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041856/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.&lt;ref name="approp request 07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/President/AppropRequest200708/Table2.asp |title=2007–08 Appropriation Request |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |publisher=University Budget Office.

=== Board of Trustees ===
{{Main|Penn State Board of Trustees}}
The university is governed by the 32-member board of trustees. Its members include the university's president, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor of the Commonwealth]], and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Education. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises.&lt;ref name=trusteesmembership&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/selection.html|title=Membership Selection|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case ''[[Benner v. Oswald]]'' ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.

{{as of|2013}}, the chair of the board of trustees is Keith E. Masser, a graduate of Penn State and the Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Sterman Masser, Inc.&lt;ref name="trusteescommittees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/committees.html |title=Committee Memberships &amp; Other Assignments|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main responsibilities of the board are to select the president of Penn State, to determine the goals and strategic direction of the university, and to approve the annual budget.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/governance.html |title=Role of the Board of Trustees in University Governance|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="trusteesmeetings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/meetings.html|title=Meeting Dates, Agendas, and Minutes|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the university is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole /&gt; [[Eric J.

=== Student government ===
[[File:Penn state hub building exterior.jpg|thumb|Penn State's student union building, the [[HUB-Robeson Center]]]]

Penn State has a long history of student governance. Elected student leaders remain directly involved in the decision-making of the university administration, as provided for in the Board of Trustee's Standing Orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/trustees/pdf/standingorders.pdf Standing Orders (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are three Student Governments recognized by the university administration: the University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA), the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), and the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG).

The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the representative student government of the 39,102&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Enrollment Fall Enrollment 2012 and 2011 |url=http://budget.psu.edu/factbook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005035001/http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergraduate students at Penn State's University Park campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Park Undergraduate Association|url=http://upua.psu.edu/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 2006 after the former student government, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), lost its recognition by way of a student referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPUA History |url=http://upua.org/history/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227101957/http://upua.org/history/|archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UPUA is composed of an Assembly of Student Representatives, an Executive Board, and a Judicial Board. The Executive Board is the bureaucratic branch of the UPUA and is led by Student Body President Katie Jordan. The Assembly, which is led by Chair Brent Rice, is the [[legislative]] body of UPUA and is composed of elected representatives whose constituencies include the academic units of Penn State, Greek Life, Freshmen Representatives, and At-Large Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Assembly |url=http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222144/http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 4, 2013|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPUA meets every Wednesday at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm in 233A HUB.

The graduate and professional students of the university are governed by the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), which is the oldest continuously existing student governance organization at Penn State.&lt;ref name=gpsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsa.psu.edu |title=GPSA – Home |website=GPSA.PSU.EDU |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |archivedate=August 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806081621/http://gpsa.psu.edu/ |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSA "work[s] on the behalf of the students to make sure that the graduate voice is heard by all levels of the administration and faculty at Penn State and to put on events geared towards graduate and professional students."&lt;ref name=gpsa /&gt;

The 19 [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses|commonwealth campuses]] of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psuccsg.org/ |title=CCSG &amp;#124; Council of Commonwealth Student Governments |website=Php.scripts.psu.edu |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929032127/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/clubs/up/ccsg/index.php |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
Penn State is [[regional accreditation|regionally accredited]] by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

{{as of|2009|September}}, only 24 Pennsylvania colleges and universities held [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] accreditation in business and only four in accounting. The [[Smeal College of Business]], The [[Sam and Irene Black School of Business]], [[Penn State Harrisburg]], and [[Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies|Penn State Great Valley]] were among the institutions accredited.&lt;ref name=aacsb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |title=Schools Accredited in Business – ordered by country, state, name |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222080454/http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |archivedate=February 22, 2007 |accessdate=February 28, 2007 |publisher=The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university offers an accelerated [[Pre-medical|Premedical]]-[[Medical education in the United States|Medical]] Program in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson University|Sidney Kimmel Medical College]].&lt;ref name="pmm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |title=Penn State's Accelerated Premedical-Medical Program |publisher=Penn State Eberly College of Science |accessdate=April 28, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414083712/http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |archivedate=April 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the program spend two or three years at the university before attending medical school at Jefferson.

Recently, a joint venture between the [[Eberly College of Science]] and the [[Smeal College of Business]] created an integrated undergraduate/graduate program to give highly motivated students the opportunity to receive a bachelor's degree in Science and an MBA two to five years sooner than those pursuing a traditional path. The BS/MBA Program prepares individuals to be future leaders of the world's scientific organizations and is led by Mr. Peter Tombros and Dr. James Gardner.

=== Demographics ===
As of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pac Island, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race. Over the period 2000–2010, minority enrollment as a percentage of total enrollments has risen 5.3 percentage points,&lt;ref name="Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/minorityenrolbyethnicity.aspx?YearCode=2010&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |title=Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity |work=Penn State Fact Book |publisher=University Budget Office.

Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang "We Shall Overcome", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''. April 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; All charges were later dismissed.

In 1990 a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to "create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences."&lt;ref name="vp ed equity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equity.psu.edu/|title=Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="framework mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equity.psu.edu/framework/campus-climate|title=Campus Climate and Intergroup Relations |work=A Framework To Foster Diversity at Penn State, 2004–2009|author=Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=December 12, 2005 |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001,&lt;ref name="village threats"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_153a562b-d9da-559a-86df-1d7ccdea836d.html|title=University, students respond to threats|last=Grote|first=Danielle|date=April 29, 2002|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_d4ef9159-6474-5dcd-9a29-a32e2e458921.html|title=African Americans Should Not Trust 'Devilish' White People|work=The Daily Collegian|accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=January 28, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson|first=Amanda|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_2e86668d-40a5-594d-8cfc-956d4018f24c.html|title=Collegian columnist generating national stir|date=February 3, 1992|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andron|first=Scott |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_397eb196-3e9e-51ba-8db3-9d586b9aa7df.html|title=Case might affect policy|work=The Daily Collegian|date=August 4, 1992|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversy around [[LGBT]] issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick R. |last=Gibbons |title=My Opinion: Conservatives Are the Group in the Closet |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/04/04-08-03tdc/04-08-03dops-column-01.asp |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603030213/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/04/04-08-03tdc/04-08-03dops-column-01.asp |archivedate=June 3, 2009 |date=April 8, 2003 |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the investigation of a 2006 sexual discrimination lawsuit filed by former Lady Lions basketball player [[Jennifer Harris]], alleging that head coach [[Rene Portland]] dismissed her from the team in part due to her perceived sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=amicable&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198428/2007/02/05/harris-claim-settled |title=Harris Claim Settled|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=February 5, 2007|accessdate=February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="old main protest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/image_3a5265c9-f4d8-5c3e-8a75-02f77779bd61.html|title=Activists Protest Diversity Policies |author1=MGll, Andrew |author2=Owens, Alyssa |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Institute was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials.

Two sports participate in different conferences: men's volleyball in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (EIVA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EIVA, Penn State Member Page|url=http://www.eivavolleyball.com/members/penn_state/index|website=Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women's hockey in [[College Hockey America]] (CHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Women's Hockey Quick Facts|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/psu/sports/w-hockey/auto_pdf/2015-16/quick_facts/quick_facts.pdf|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics |format=PDF|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fencing teams operate as independents.

Athletic teams at Penn State have won 77 national collegiate team championships (49 [[NCAA]], 2 consensus [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|Division I football]] titles, 6 [[AIAW Champions|AIAW]], 3 USWLA, 1 [[Women's International Bowling Congress|WIBC]], and 4 national titles in boxing, 11 in men's soccer and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html Penn State championship history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324043952/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html# |date=March 24, 2009 }}".

Since joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] in 1991, Penn State teams have won 103 conference regular season and tournament titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html|title=Penn State Has Won 103 Big Ten Regular Season and Tournament Championships|last=|first=|date=|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704120746/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html#|archive-date=July 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, as evidenced by its rankings in the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.&lt;ref name=dcup&gt;{{cite web|title=Nittany Lions No. 9 in Final Directors' Cup Standings; Penn State Earns Eighth Top 10 Finish in the Survey's 15 Years|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/062608aab.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite widespread success in the overall athletic program, however, the school is best known for its [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football team]], which draws a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second largest [[seating capacity]] of any stadium in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortuna |first=Matt |accessdate=September 24, 2008 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |title=Beaver To Rule Arenas |date=March 17, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202110638/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an official capacity of 106,572 slightly behind Michigan Stadium with an official capacity of 107,601. For decades, the football team was led by coach [[Joe Paterno]]. Paterno was in a close competition with [[Bobby Bowden]], the head coach for [[Florida State]], for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. This competition effectively ended with Paterno still leading following Bowden's retirement after the [[2010 Gator Bowl]]. In 2007, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paterno inducted into College Football Hall of Fame |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/192048/2007/11/30/paterno-inducted-college-football-hall-fame|publisher= Pennsylvania State University |date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division 1 history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Penn State wins restored, Joe Paterno the winningest coach again |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/01/16/ncaa-joe-paterno-wins-restored-penn-state-settlement/21867685/ |accessdate=November 27, 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85.

The school's wrestling team has also become noticed. Under [[Cael Sanderson]], the Nittany Lions won six national titles in a seven-year span, from 2011 to 2017.

The university opened a new [[Penn State All-Sports Museum]] in February 2002. This two-level {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.&lt;ref name="sports museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=GoPSUsports.com – Official Home of Penn State Athletics |url=http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723052027/http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the school funded athletics, club sports also play a major role in the university, with over 68 club sport organizations meeting regularly to date. Many club teams compete nationally in their respective sports. The Penn State Ski Team, which competes as part of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) in the Allegheny Conference, as well as the Penn State Swim Club, which competes in the American Swimming Association – University League (ASAU), are just a few examples. Some other clubs include baseball, [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[karate]], [[crew (sport)|crew]], and sailing.

Penn State's most well known athletic cheer is "We are...Penn State." Typically, the students and cheerleaders shout, "We are," followed by a response of "Penn State" from the rest of the fans. By tradition, this is done three times, and followed by "Thank you..." "... You're welcome!"

Since 2001, the university, along with all schools in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], has participated in the "Big Ten Challenge" website, which is a "competitive" clearinghouse of alumni donation statistics for member schools. Results are tracked to determine a percentage of each school's alumni from the previous decade who gave to their alma mater each calendar year (during the 2005–2006 year, alumni donations from 1996 to 2005 were tallied).

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]] 1434.  Among other changes, his face was higher by about the height of his eye, hers was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.  Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third.  These alterations are seen in infra-red reflectograms.]]
A '''pentimento''' (plural '''pentimenti''') is an alteration in a painting, evidenced by traces of previous work, showing that the artist has changed their mind as to the composition during the process of painting. The word is [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''repentance,'' from the verb ''[[wikt:pentirsi|pentirsi]]'', meaning to repent.

==Significance==
Pentimenti may show that a composition originally had an element, for example a head or a hand, in a slightly different place, or that an element no longer in the final painting was originally planned.  The changes may have been done in the [[underdrawing]] of the painting, or by the visible layers of paint differing from the underdrawing, or by the first painted treatment of the element having been over-painted.

Some pentimenti have always been visible on the final painting with careful inspection; others are revealed by the increasing transparency that some paint acquires after several centuries. Others, especially in the underdrawing, can only be seen with modern methods such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Infrared reflectography#Art history|infrared reflectography]] and photographs.  These are able to record photographically some [[pigment]]s, depending on their chemical composition, which remain covered by later paint layers. For example, [[white lead]], a common pigment, will be detected by X-ray, and [[carbon black]] underdrawings can often be seen with great clarity in infra-red reflectograms.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221432/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/72881.html] These methods have greatly expanded the number of pentimenti art historians are aware of, and confirmed that they are very common in the works of many [[old master]]s, from [[Jan van Eyck]] onwards.
[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The face of the woman in the image that ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''is painted over. These marks would not usually be described as ''pentimenti'' as the subjects are totally different]]

Pentimenti are considered especially important when considering whether a particular painting is the first version by the original artist, or a second version by the artist himself, or his workshop, or a later copyist. Normally secondary versions or copies will have few if any pentimenti, although this will not always be the case, as in ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].  Like [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and many other masters, Caravaggio seems rarely to have made preliminary drawings, but to have composed straight onto the canvas.  The number of pentimenti found in the work of such masters naturally tends to be higher.

Marks revealing a totally different subject, for example in ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''by [[Picasso]], are not usually described as pentimenti - the artist has abandoned his ''earlier composition'' to begin a new one. In cases where a composition has been changed by a later painter or restorer, marks showing the original composition would not be described as pentimenti either—it must be the original painter who has changed his mind.

==Usage in English==
The term is usually treated as an Italian word and therefore written in italics, depending on the style used in the individual context.  The fully anglicised word ''pentiment'' (plural ''pentiments'') is much rarer, though included in the [[Grove Dictionary of Art]].  The distinction between singular and plural is also rather flexible; some writers refer to a change of just one outline as ''pentimenti'', whilst others treat each area that has been changed as a single ''pentimento''. The word "pentimento" is occasionally used synonymously with "palimpsest", but strictly the latter is used for documents and parchments which, due to fading, have been reused.

==Examples==
[[File:Cardsharps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]].]]
[[File:La casa de Nazaret, por Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|right|''Christ and the Virgin in the House at Nazareth'' by [[Zurbarán]], Cleveland.]]
A portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]] of Jacques de Norvins by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] was painted in 1811–12 when the sitter was [[Napoleon]]'s Chief of Police in Rome. Originally, instead of the curtain at the left, there was a fully painted bust of a boy's head on top of a small column.  Probably this was a bust of Napoleon's son, who was known as the King of Rome. The presumption is that this was overpainted with the curtain after the fall of Napoleon, either by Ingres himself, or another artist.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue, National Gallery Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85709-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bust can just be made out in the enlarged online photo, with its chin level with the sitter's hair-line; the top of the column was level with the middle of the sitter's ear.  These may always have been (just) visible, or have become so by the paint becoming transparent with age.  Few viewers of the painting would notice the bust without it being pointed out.  Strictly speaking, these alterations might not be described as pentimenti, because of the presumed lapse of time, and because another artist may have made the change.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3291]

An example by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] can be found in his work ''[[Leonardo Da Vinci|Salvator Mundi]]'', which was sold to a private collector for more than $450 million after being restored by Christie's auction house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leonardo-da-vinci-painting-salvator-mundi-sells-for-450-3-million-1510794281|title=Leonardo da Vinci Painting ‘Salvator Mundi’ Smashes Records With $450.3 Million Sale|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=16 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work  by [[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]], has a number of typical minor pentimenti, altering the position of the figure on the right, which are revealed by infra-red reflectograms.  These are used in discussing the painting and comparing it to another version of the subject in [[Bari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001114100/http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zurbarán]] in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] shows that the size of a white cloth was expanded after the dark background under-paint had been applied; the expanded area is a darker white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221750/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of the discovery of pentimenti after conservation and cleaning, the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]] changed its opinion on its version of Manet’s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from that of it being a copy to  it being a preparatory painting that predates the version in the Louvre. Pentimenti were visible once the old varnish was removed, including alterations to the curve of the back of the female nude and one of the male figure's cap, suggesting that the Courtauld picture is a preparatory work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Baily, "London version of Manet’s Le déjeuner sur l’herbe predates the bigger picture in Paris", The Art Newspaper, 26 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term has sometimes been used in a modern sense to describe the appearance of the sides of buildings with painted advertising.  Often old ads are painted over with newer ads and the paint wears away to reveal the older layers. Examples in [[Amsterdam]], [[New York City]] and elsewhere have been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fadingad.com/009.html|title=Amsterdam Ediglyph|last=Jump|first=Frank H.|date=2008-02-28|website=www.fadingad.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankjump.com|title=Fading Ad Campaign|website=www.frankjump.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9939">The term '''phonestheme''' ({{IPAc-en|f|oʊ|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|θ|iː|m}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|phonestheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''phonaestheme''' in British English) was coined in 1930 by British linguist [[J. R. Firth]] (from the Greek φωνή ''phone'', "sound", and αἴσθημα ''aisthema'', "perception" from αίσθάνομαι ''aisthanomai'', "I perceive")  to label the systematic pairing of form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Firth, J. R. | authorlink = J. R. Firth |year=1964 |orig-year=1930 |title = The Tongues of Men, and Speech | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = London | page = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such pairing would violate the [[Course_in_General_Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness principle]] of [[semantics]].

A phonestheme is different from a [[morpheme]] because it does not meet the normal criterion of [[compositionality]].

Within [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce's]] "theory of signs" the phonestheme is considered to be an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|icon]]" rather than a "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|symbol]]" or an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|index]]".

==Identification==
Phonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme.  Phonesthemes "fascinate some linguists", as [[Ben Zimmer]] has phrased it, in a process that can become "mystical" or "unscientific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |author-link=Ben_Zimmer |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2014/10/lexicon_valley_the_etymology_and_history_of_the_word_snark_with_lexicographer.html |title=Where Did the Word ''Snark'' Come From? |website=Lexicon Valley |publisher=Slate |host=Bob Garfield and Mike Vuolo |date=2014-10-20 |time=0:27:30 |access-date=2015-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, the English phonestheme "gl-" occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like "glitter", "glisten", "glow", "gleam", "glare", "glint", "glimmer", "gloss", and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., "-isten", "-ow", and "-eam" do not make meaningful contributions to "glisten", "glow", and "gleam".
There are three main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.

===Corpus studies===
The first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.

Corpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.

===Study of patterns in neologisms===
The second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of [[neologisms]] (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word ''bangle'' is a [[Loanword|loan]] from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] but speakers tend to associate it with English [[onomatopoeia]] like ''bang''. While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.

===Study of linguistic processing patterns===
The final type of evidence uses the methods of [[psycholinguistics]] to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.

Discussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of [[sound symbolism]].

==Distribution==
Phonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other [[Indo-European languages]], [[Austronesian languages]], and Japanese.

While phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like "-ash" and "-ack" in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact ("smash", "crash", "bash", etc.) and abrupt contact ("smack", "whack", "crack", etc.), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolinger |first=Dwight |date=1980 |title=Language, the Loaded Weapon: The use and abuse of language today |location=New York |publisher=Longman |page=20 |isbn=0582291089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their ''motivation''. In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of "-ack", for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as "gl-", for the simple reason that their meanings (such as 'pertaining to light or vision') entail no sound.

While there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato's
Cratylus clearly mentioned the gl- and st- phonesthemes and their explanation in terms of phonosemantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leonardi |first=Filippo Maria |date=2015 |title=Phonesthemes in Latin Language |publisher=Academia.edu |url=https://www.academia.edu/17549917/Phonesthemes_in_Latin_Language_2015_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of phonesthemes in English (aside from "gl-"), include "sn-", related to the mouth or nose, as in "snarl", "snout", "snicker", "snack", and so on; and there is also a set of words starting with "sl-", which appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like "slide", "slick", "sled", and so on - which are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with sl- that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slosh, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth, sleepy, sleet, slip, slipshod, slope, slit, slay, sleek, slant, slovenly, slab, slap, slough, slum, slump, slobber, slaver, slur, slog, slate.

==Ablaut phonesthesia==
{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}
A further phonesthetic phenomenon, ablaut [[phonesthesia]], mimics the paradigm of a strong verb like ''swim'' : ''swam'' : ''swum'' with internal vowel change or ''[[apophony]]''. Take the word "flip."  It has an alliterative group, "fl-", that evokes the volatility of fly, flow, flee, fleet, flash, flake, and flick. Its rhymes, dip, sip, quip, drip, pip, tip, slip, and so forth, add to a connotation of minor labile action. But it is also part of an ablaut series where vowel alternation has semantic value (as in "flip-flop").

This kind of vowel alternation can be found in reduplicated word pairs like "pitter-patter," "chit-chat," "tip-top," or "tip-tap."

A regularity of phonesthetic relationship is shown by proportional analogies such as '''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp''';&lt;ref&gt;The conventionally abbreviated expressions, such as "'''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp'''", when fully expanded, are read as "'''clip''' is to '''clasp''' in precisely the same way as '''grip''' is to '''grasp'''", and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''crash : crush :: mash : mush'''; or '''crash : crunch :: mash : munch'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |mailing-list=Linguist List |last=Grew |first=Philip |title=re: 9.1050 Phonological Clusters of Semantically Similar Words |date=1998-08-05 |url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/9/9-1106.html |access-date=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], a '''pitch class''' ('''p.c.''' or '''pc''') is a [[set (music)|set]] of all [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] that are a whole number of [[octave]]s apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. "The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Whittall]], ''The Cambridge Introduction to Serialism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008): 276. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Important to [[musical set theory]], a pitch class is, "all pitches related to each other by octave, [[Enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]], or both."&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel, ed. (2003). "Set theory", ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.776. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, using [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class "C" is the set

:{C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' is an [[integer]]} = {..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...};

although there is no formal upper or lower limit to this sequence, only a limited number of these pitches are audible to the human ear. 
Pitch class is important because human [[Pitch (psychophysics)|pitch-perception]] is [[Periodic function|periodic]]: pitches belonging to the same pitch class are perceived as having a similar quality or color, a property called "[[octave equivalence]]".

Psychologists refer to the quality of a pitch as its "chroma".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Tymoczko|Tymoczko, Dmitri]] (2011). ''A Geometry of Music: Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice'', p.30. Oxford Studies in Music Theory. {{ISBN|9780199714353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''chroma'' is an attribute of pitches (as opposed to ''tone height''), just like [[hue]] is an attribute of [[color]]. A ''pitch class'' is a set of all pitches that share the same chroma, just like "the set of all white things" is the collection of all white objects.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Meinard (2007). ''Information Retrieval for Music and Motion'', p.60. {{ISBN|9783540740483}}. "A pitch class is defined to be the set of all pitches that share the same chroma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in standard Western [[equal temperament]], distinct spellings can refer to the same sounding object: B{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and D{{music|bb}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; all refer to the same pitch, hence share the same chroma, and therefore belong to the same pitch class; a phenomenon called [[enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]].

==Integer notation==
To avoid the problem of enharmonic spellings, theorists typically represent pitch classes using numbers beginning from zero, with each successively larger integer representing a pitch class that would be one semitone higher than the preceding one, if they were all realised as actual pitches in the same octave. Because octave-related pitches belong to the same class, when an octave is reached, the numbers begin again at zero. This cyclical system is referred to as [[modular arithmetic]] and, in the usual case of chromatic twelve-tone scales, pitch-class numbering is regarded as "modulo 12" (customarily abbreviated "mod 12" in the music-theory literature)—that is, every twelfth member is identical. One can map a pitch's fundamental frequency ''f'' (measured in [[hertz]]) to a real number ''p'' using the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 9 + 12\log_2 \frac{f}{440\text{ Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;

This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, [[semitone]]s (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is assigned the number 0 (thus, the pitches on [[piano]] are −39 to +48). Indeed, the mapping from pitch to real numbers defined in this manner forms the basis of the [[MIDI Tuning Standard]], which uses the real numbers from 0 to 127 to represent the pitches C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (thus, middle C is 60). To represent pitch ''classes'', we need to identify or "glue together" all pitches belonging to the same pitch class&amp;mdash;i.e.&amp;nbsp;all numbers ''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12. The result is a cyclical [[quotient group]] that musicians call [[pitch class space]] and mathematicians call '''R'''/12'''Z'''. Points in this space can be labelled using [[real number]]s in the range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;12. These numbers provide numerical alternatives to the letter names of elementary music theory: 

:0 = C, 1 = C{{music|#}}/D{{music|b}}, 2 = D, 2.5 = D{{music|t}} ([[quarter tone]] sharp), 3 = D{{music|#}}/E{{music|b}},

and so on. In this system, pitch classes represented by integers are classes of [[12 equal temperament|twelve-tone equal temperament]] (assuming standard concert A).

[[Image:Integer notation.png|thumb|right|350px|Integer notation.]]

In [[music]], '''integer notation''' is the translation of pitch classes and/or [[interval class]]es into [[integer|whole numbers]].&lt;ref name="Whittall"&gt;Whittall (2008), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if C&amp;nbsp;= 0, then C{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 1 ... A{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 10, B&amp;nbsp;= 11, with "10" and "11" substituted by "t" and "e" in some sources,&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt; ''A'' and ''B'' in others&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Morris, "Generalizing Rotational Arrays", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 32, no. 1 (Spring 1988): 75–132, citation on 83.&lt;/ref&gt; (like the [[duodecimal]] numeral system, which also uses "t" and "e", or ''A'' and ''B'', for "10" and "11"). This allows the most economical presentation of information regarding [[post-tonal]] materials.&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt;

In the integer model of pitch, all pitch classes and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11. It is not used to notate music for performance, but is a common [[musical analysis|analytical]] and [[musical composition|compositional]] tool when working with chromatic music, including [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], [[serialism|serial]], or otherwise [[atonality|atonal]] music.

Pitch classes can be notated in this way by assigning the number 0 to some note and assigning consecutive integers to consecutive [[semitone]]s; so if 0 is C natural, 1 is C{{Music|sharp}}, 2 is D{{Music|natural}} and so on up to 11, which is B{{Music|natural}}. The C above this is not 12, but 0 again (12&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). Thus arithmetic [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 12 is used to represent [[octave]] [[Equivalence class (music)|equivalence]]. One advantage of this system is that it ignores the "spelling" of notes (B{{Music|sharp}}, C{{Music|natural}} and D{{Music|doubleflat}} are all 0) according to their [[diatonic functionality]].

===Disadvantages===
&lt;!--1st disadvantage--&gt;There are a few disadvantages with integer notation. First, theorists have traditionally used the same integers to indicate elements of different tuning systems. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2,&amp;nbsp;... 5, are used to notate pitch classes in 6-tone equal temperament. This means that the meaning of a given integer changes with the underlying tuning system: "1" can refer to C{{music|#}} in 12-tone equal temperament, but D in 6-tone equal temperament.

&lt;!--2nd disadvantage--&gt;Also, the same numbers are used to represent both [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[interval (music)|intervals]]. For example, the number 4 serves both as a label for the pitch class E (if C&amp;nbsp;= 0) and as a label for the ''distance'' between the pitch classes D and F{{music|#}}. (In much the same way, the term "10 degrees" can label both a temperature and the distance between two temperatures.) Only one of these labelings is sensitive to the (arbitrary) choice of pitch class 0. For example, if one makes a different choice about which pitch class is labeled 0, then the pitch class E will no longer be labeled "4". However, the distance between D and F{{music|#}} will still be assigned the number 4. Both this and the issue in the paragraph directly above may be viewed as disadvantages (though mathematically, an element "4" should not be confused with the function "+4").

The system described above is flexible enough to describe any pitch class in any tuning system: for example, one can use the numbers {0, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2, 9.6} to refer to the five-tone scale that divides the octave evenly. However, in some contexts, it is convenient to use alternative labeling systems.  For example, in [[just intonation]], we may express pitches in terms of positive rational numbers {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}, expressed by reference to a 1 (often written "{{sfrac|1|1}}"), which represents a fixed pitch. If ''a'' and ''b'' are two positive rational numbers, they belong to the same pitch class if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[integer]] ''n''. Therefore, we can represent pitch classes in this system using ratios {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} where neither ''p'' nor ''q'' is divisible by 2, that is, as ratios of odd integers. Alternatively, we can represent just intonation pitch classes by reducing to the octave, 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2.

It is also very common to label pitch classes with reference to some [[Scale (music)|scale]].  For example, one can label the pitch classes of ''n''-tone [[equal temperament]] using the integers 0 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In much the same way, one could label the pitch classes of the C major scale, C–D–E–F–G–A–B, using the numbers from 0 to 6.  This system has two advantages over the continuous labeling system described above.  First, it eliminates any suggestion that there is something natural about a twelvefold division of the octave.  Second, it avoids pitch-class universes with unwieldy decimal expansions when considered relative to 12; for example, in the continuous system, the pitch-classes of [[19 equal temperament]] are labeled 0.63158..., 1.26316..., etc. Labeling these pitch classes {0, 1, 2, 3 ..., 18} simplifies the arithmetic used in pitch-class set manipulations.

The disadvantage of the scale-based system is that it assigns an infinite number of different names to chords that sound identical.  For example, in twelve-tone equal-temperament the C major triad is notated {0, 4, 7}.  In twenty-four-tone equal-temperament, this same triad is labeled {0, 8, 14}.  Moreover, the scale-based system appears to suggest that different tuning systems use steps of the same size ("1") but have octaves of differing size ("12" in 12-tone equal-temperament, "19" in 19-tone equal temperament, and so on), whereas in fact the opposite is true: different tuning systems divide the same octave into different-sized steps.

In general, it is often more useful to use the traditional integer system when one is working within a single temperament; when one is comparing chords in different temperaments, the continuous system can be more useful.

Positive psychologists have suggested a number of ways in which individual happiness may be fostered. Social ties with a spouse, family, friends and wider networks through work, clubs or social organisations are of particular importance, while physical exercise and the practice of meditation may also contribute to happiness. Happiness may rise with increasing financial income, though it may plateau or even fall when no further gains are made.&lt;ref&gt;Positive Psychology Progress: Empirical Validation of Interventions.

==Definition and basic assumptions==

===Definition===
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi define positive psychology as "... the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels that include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} Christopher Peterson defines positive psychology as "... the scientific study of what makes life most worth living".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"/&gt;

===Basic concepts===
Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification".{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}} According to Christopher Peterson, "eudaimonia trumps [[hedonism]]".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"/&gt;

Positive psychology complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, and which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive self-esteem and self-image, though positive psychologists with a less humanist bent are less likely to focus as intently on the matter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/212086932/1156084440D45A8PQ/4?accountid=12599|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often drawn by the future more than they are driven by the past. A change in our orientation to time can dramatically affect how we think about the nature of happiness. Seligman identified other possible goals: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.&lt;ref name="SeligmanMartin"&gt;Seligman, Martin E.P. "Positive Psychology Center." Positive Psychology Center. University of Pennsylvania, 2007. Web. 12 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who practice positive psychology attempt [[psychological intervention]]s that foster positive attitudes toward one's  subjective experiences, individual traits, and life events.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Seligman, M. E., &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2014). Positive psychology: An introduction (pp. 279-298). Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to minimize [[Pathology|pathological]] thoughts that may arise in a hopeless mindset, and to, instead, develop a sense of optimism toward life.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Positive psychologists seek to encourage acceptance of one's past, excitement and optimism about one's future experiences, and a sense of contentment and well-being in the present.&lt;ref name="14 March 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shesthra|first1=Arjun|title=Positive psychology: Evolution, philosophical foundations, and present growth|journal=Indian Journal of Positive Psychology|date=December 2016|volume=7|issue=4|pages=460-465|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1862867466/AF014FD42A0A4CA2PQ/10?accountid=12599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related concepts are [[happiness]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].

===Research topics===
According to Seligman and Peterson, positive psychology is concerned with three issues: [[positive emotions]], positive individual traits, and positive institutions. Positive emotions are concerned with being content with one's past, being happy in the present and having hope for the future. Positive individual traits focus on one's strengths and virtues. Finally, positive institutions are based on strengths to better a community of people.&lt;ref name="SeligmanMartin" /&gt;

According to Peterson, positive psychologists are concerned with four topics: (1) positive experiences, (2) enduring psychological traits, (3) positive relationships, and (4) positive institutions.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} According to Peterson, topics of interest to [[List of positive psychologists|researchers in the field]] are: states of [[pleasure]] or [[flow (psychology)|flow]], values, strengths, [[virtue]]s, talents, as well as the ways that these can be promoted by social systems and institutions.{{sfn|Peterson|2006}}


==History==
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Comprehensive Soldiers Fitness (1)cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|To [[Martin Seligman]], psychology (particularly its positive branch) can investigate and promote realistic ways of fostering more well-being in individuals and communities.]]

===Origin===
The term positive psychology dates back at least to 1954, when Maslow's first edition of ''Motivation and personality''  was published with a final chapter titled "Toward a Positive Psychology."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation and Personality|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1970|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second edition (1970), he removed that chapter, saying in the preface that "a  positive psychology is at least available today though not very widely."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  There have been indications that psychologists since the 1950s have been increasingly focused on the promotion of mental health rather than merely treating mental illness.&lt;ref name="twsMay18g45r"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.her.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/1/57.pdf|title=Current conceptualizations of mental health and mental health promotion|author=Secker J|accessdate=2010-05-18|publisher=Health Education Research|year=1998|issue=1|volume=13|page=58|quote=...

{{quote|The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the positive side. It has revealed to us much about man’s shortcomings, his illness, his sins, but little about his potentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his full psychological height. It is as if psychology has voluntarily restricted itself to only half its rightful jurisdiction, the darker, meaner half.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Motivation and Psychology, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;}}}} He urged psychologists to continue the earlier missions of psychology of nurturing talent and improving normal life.{{sfn|Compton|2005|pp=1–22}}

===Development===
The first positive psychology summit took place in 1999. The First International Conference on Positive Psychology took place in 2002.{{sfn|Compton|2005|pp=1–22}} More attention was given by the general public in 2006 when, using the same framework, a course at [[Harvard University]] became particularly popular.&lt;ref name="Happier"&gt;Ben-Shahar, Ben (2007) "Happier -Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment", First Edition, McGraw-Hill Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the First World Congress on Positive Psychology took place at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, Jun 18, 2009: [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS130343+18-Jun-2009+PRN20090618 First World Congress on Positive Psychology Kicks Off Today With Talks by Two of the World's Most Renowned Psychologists]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Positive Psychology Association (IPPA) is a recently established association that has expanded to thousands of members from 80 different countries. The IPPA's missions include: (1) "further the science of positive psychology across the globe and to ensure that the field continues to rest on this science" (2) "work for the effective and responsible application of positive psychology in diverse areas such as organizational psychology, counselling and clinical psychology, business, health, education, and coaching", (3) "foster education and training in the field".&lt;ref&gt;International Positive Psychology Association (IPPA) (2011). international positive psychology association.

The field of positive psychology today is most advanced in the United States and Western Europe. Even though positive psychology offers a new approach to the study of positive emotions and behavior, the ideas, theories, research, and motivation to study the positive side of human behavior is as old as humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Compton, William C., and Edward Hoffman.

===Influences===

Several [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologists]], most notably [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Carl Rogers]], and [[Erich Fromm]], developed theories and practices pertaining to human [[happiness]] and flourishing. More recently, ''positive'' psychologists have found empirical support for the humanistic theories of flourishing. In addition, positive psychology has moved ahead in a variety of new directions.

In 1984, Diener published his [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], positing "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, cognitive, affective and contextual factors contribute to subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Galinha_Pais-Ribeiro_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa Galinha | first1 = Iolanda | last2 = Pais-Ribeiro | first2 = José Luís | year = 2011 | title = Cognitive, affective and contextual predictors of subjective wellbeing | url = | journal = International Journal of Wellbeing | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 34–53 | doi = 10.5502/ijw.v2i1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diener and Suh, subjective well-being is "...based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diener, Suh|first=Ed, Eunkook|title=Culture and Subjective Well-being|year=2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Ryff's [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]] was initially published in 1989, and additional testing of its factors was published in 1995. It postulates six factors which are key for well-being, namely [[self-acceptance]], [[personal growth]], [[purpose in life]], environmental mastery, [[autonomy]], and positive relations with others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livingmeanings.com/six-criteria-well-ryffs-multidimensional-model/ ''Carol Ryff’s Model of Psychological Well-being. The Six Criteria of Well-Being'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Corey Keyes]], who collaborated with Carol Ryff and uses the term [[flourishing]] as a central concept, mental well-being has three components, namely hedonic (c.q. subjective or emotional&lt;ref name="Robitschek"/&gt;), psychological, and social well-being.{{sfn|Keyes|2002}} Hedonic well-being concerns emotional aspects of well-being, whereas psychological and social well-being, c.q eudaimonic well-being, concerns skills, abilities, and optimal functioning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2015-10-23|title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|pages=1–14|doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tripartite model of mental well-being has received extensive empirical support across cultures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robitschek"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robitschek|first=Christine|last2=Keyes|first2=Corey L.

==Theory and methods==
{{Main|Well-being}}
There is no accepted "gold standard" theory in positive psychology, however the work of Seligman is regularly quoted.&lt;ref name="Sze"/&gt; So too the work of Csikszentmihalyi and older models of well-being, such as [[Carol Ryff's Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]] and Diener's [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]].

===Initial theory: three paths to happiness===
In ''Authentic Happiness'' (2002) Seligman proposed three kinds of a happy life which can be investigated:{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=275}}&lt;ref name="Sze"&gt;David Sze (2015), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html ''The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pleasant life'': research into the [[pleasure|Pleasant]] Life, or the "life of enjoyment", examines how people optimally experience, [[Affective forecasting|forecast]], and savor the positive feelings and emotions that are part of normal and healthy living (e.g., relationships, hobbies, interests, entertainment, etc.). Despite the attention given, Martin Seligman says this most transient element of happiness may be the least important.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Good Life'': investigation of the beneficial effects of immersion, absorption, and ''[[flow (psychology)|flow]]'', felt by individuals when optimally engaged with their primary activities, is the study of the Good Life, or the "life of engagement". Flow is experienced when there is a positive match between a person's strength and their current task, i.e., when one feels confident of accomplishing a chosen or assigned task.{{efn|See related concepts: [[Self-efficacy]] and [[play (activity)|play]].}}
# ''Meaningful Life'': inquiry into the [[Meaningful Life]], or "life of affiliation", questions how individuals derive a positive sense of well-being, belonging, meaning, and purpose from being part of and contributing back to something larger and more permanent than themselves (e.g., nature, social groups, organizations, movements, traditions, belief systems).

===PERMA===
In ''Flourish'' (2011) Seligman argued that the last category of his proposed three kinds of a happy life, "[[meaningful life]]", can be considered as 3 different categories. The resulting acronym is [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|PERMA]]: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and purpose, and Accomplishments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html|title=The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness|last=Sze|first=David|date=2015-06-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mnemonic for the five elements of Martin Seligman's well-being theory:&lt;ref name="Sze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |title=The World Question Center 2011— Page 2 |publisher=Edge.org |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Positive emotions'' include a wide range of feelings, not just happiness and joy.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}} Included are emotions like excitement, satisfaction, pride and awe, amongst others. These emotions are frequently seen as connected to positive outcomes, such as longer life and healthier social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-positive-psychology/|title=The Pursuit of Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Engagement'' refers to involvement in activities that draws and builds upon one's interests. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] explains true engagement as [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], a state of deep effortless involvement,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; feeling of intensity that leads to a sense of ecstasy and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi TED talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task being done needs to call upon higher skill and be a bit difficult and challenging yet still possible. Engagement involves passion for and concentration on the task at hand and is assessed subjectively as to whether the person engaged was completely absorbed, losing self-consciousness.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}}
* ''Relationships'' are essential in fueling positive emotions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brain-sharp.com/blogs/news/healthy-lifestyle-tips|title=Healthy Lifestyle Tips|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, whether they are work-related, familial, romantic, or platonic. As [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] puts it simply, "Other people matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-beauty-in-the-beast/201210/other-people-matter|title=Other People Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans receive, share, and spread positivity to others through relationships.  They are important not only in bad times, but good times as well. In fact, relationships can be strengthened by reacting to one another positively. It is typical that most positive things take place in the presence of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|title=Using Positive Psychology in Your Relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Meaning'' is also known as purpose, and prompts the question of "why". Discovering and figuring out a clear "why" puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|title=Why do You do What You Do?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than one's self. Despite potential challenges, working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.
* ''Accomplishments'' are the pursuit of success and mastery.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}} Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships. That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.

Each of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:
# It contributes to well-being.
# It is pursued for its own sake.
# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.

===''Character  Strengths and Virtues''===
The development of the ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' (CSV) handbook (2004) represented the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., "core virtues"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}

The CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1. The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2. the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are "evolutionarily predisposed" toward certain virtues, and 3. virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}

The organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:
# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]
# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]
# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]
# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]
# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]
# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]

Recent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

These strengths, and their classifications, have emerged independently elsewhere in literature on values.  Paul Thagard described examples; these included Jeff Shrager's workshops to discover the habits of highly creative people.&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, P. (2005). How to be a successful scientist. In M. E.

Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and technological thinking (pp. 159- 171). Mawah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum
Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that well-being effects that appear to be due to spirituality are actually better described as due to virtue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways?

===Flow===

In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's began studying ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work. Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt;



==Applications and research findings==
{{Main|Well-being contributing factors}}

Research in positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligman cover a broad range of topics including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life".{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} A [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies in 2009 showed that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) produced improvements in well-being and lower depression levels, the PPIs studied included writing gratitude letters, learning optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences and socializing with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.20593/epdf|title=Enhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms With Positive Psychology Interventions:A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis|author1=Nancy L. Sin|author2=Sonja Lyubomirsky|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|doi=10.1002/jclp|volume=65|issue=5|date=May 2009|pages=467–487, particularly 468, 471, 474, 483}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later meta-analysis of 39 studies with 6,139 participants in 2012, the outcomes were positive. Three to six months after a PPI the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant. However the positive effect was weaker than in the 2009 meta analysis, the authors concluded that this was because they only used higher quality studies. The PPIs they considered included counting blessings, [[kindness]] practices, making personal goals, showing gratitude and focusing on personal strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-119|title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies|author1=Linda Bolier|author2=et al.|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2013|volume=13|issue=119|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilona Boniwell, in her book ''Positive Psychology in a Nutshell'', provided the following summary of the current research. Wellbeing is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e. close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health). Wellbeing is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).&lt;ref&gt;Positive Psychology in a Nutshell, Ilona Boniwell, Open University Press, 2012, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How Of Happiness'', says that to improve happiness individuals should create new habits; they can seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.&lt;ref&gt;The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2007, Piatkus, p.270-p.294&lt;/ref&gt; Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities such as savouring life, learning to forgive and living in the present, each of which could become the basis for a new habit.

In ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', the authors Compton and Hoffman give the "Top Down Predictors" of wellbeing as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others. The personality traits most associated with well being are [[extraversion]], [[agreeability]] and low levels of [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Positive Psychology The Science of Happiness, William C. Compton and Edward Hoffman, Wadsworth, 2005, p.55-p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation'', Kreutzer and Mills argue for the principles of positive psychology to be implemented to assist those recovering from traumatic brain injury (TBR). They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI vocational rehabilitation (VR) also looks at happiness and its correlation with improvements in mental health, including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behaviour is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}}

==Criticism==
According to [[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few. Furthermore, Schneider pointed to a body of research showing high positivity correlates with positive illusion, which effectively distorts reality.&lt;ref name="Schneider, K. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schneider, K.|year=2011|title=Toward a Humanistic Positive Psychology|journal=Existential Analysis: Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis|volume=22|issue=1|pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the downfall of high positivity (also known as flourishing) is one could become incapable of psychological growth, unable to self-reflect, and tend to hold racial biases.  By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality. Therefore, negativity might play an important role within the dynamics of human flourishing.  To illustrate, conflict engagement and acknowledgement of appropriate negativity, including certain negative emotions like guilt, might better promote flourishing.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, B. L. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Losada | first2 = M. F. | year = 2005 | title = Positive Affect and the Complex Dynamics of Human Flourishing | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7| pages = 678–686 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 | pmid=16221001 | pmc=3126111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Schneider provided perspective: "perhaps genuine happiness is not something you aim at, but is a by-product of a life well lived&amp;nbsp;– and a life well lived does not settle on the programmed or neatly calibrated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schneider |first=Kirk J. |author-link=Kirk J. Schneider |date=29 November 2010 |title=Toward a Humanistic Positive Psychology: Why Can't We Just Get Along? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/awakening-awe/201011/toward-humanistic-positive-psychology-why-cant-we-just-get-along |website=Psychology Today |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seligman has acknowledged in his work the point about positive illusion,{{sfn|Seligman|1995|pp=295–299}} and is also a critic of merely feeling good about oneself apart from reality and recognises the importance of negativity / dysphoria.{{sfn|Seligman|1995|pp=41–42}}

Ian Sample, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', noted that, "Positive psychologists also stand accused of burying their heads in the sand and ignoring that depressed, even merely unhappy people, have real problems that need dealing with." Sample also quoted Steven Wolin, a clinical psychiatrist at [[George Washington University]], as saying that the study of positive psychology is just a reiteration of older ways of thinking, and that there is not much scientific research to support the efficacy of this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sample, I.|date=19 November 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/19/1|title=How to be happy|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gable responds to criticism on their pollyanna view on the world by saying that they are just bringing a balance to a side of psychology that is glaringly understudied.&lt;ref&gt;Gable, S. L., &amp; Haidt, J. (2005). What (and why) is positive psychology?. Review of general psychology, 9(2), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; To defend his point, Gable points to the imbalances favouring research into negative psychological wellbeing in cognitive psychology, health psychology, and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shesthra|first1=Arjun|title=Positive psychology: Evolution, Philosophical Foundations, and Present Growth|journal=Indian Journal of Positive Psychology|date=December 2016|volume=7|issue=4|page=460-465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara S. Held]] argued that while positive psychology makes contributions to the field of psychology, it has its faults. She offered insight into topics including the negative side effects of positive psychology, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the current division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A "one size fits all" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.{{sfn|Held|2004}}

Martin Jack has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional wellbeing, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counselling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment. He goes on to mention that, while positive psychology has pushed for schools to be more student-centred and able to foster positive self-images in children, he worries that a lack of focus on self-control may prevent children from making full contributions to society. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Jack|title=Self Research in Educational Psychology: A Cautionary Tale of Positive Psychology in Action.|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=2006|volume=140|issue=4|page=307-316|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.mta.ca/docview/213832759/801886035B3C49C5PQ/1?accountid=12599|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Public Opinion''''' is a book by [[Walter Lippmann]], published in 1922. It is a critical assessment of functional democratic government, especially of the irrational and often self-serving social perceptions that influence individual behavior and prevent optimal [[Group cohesiveness|societal cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Pseudo-environment==
The introduction describes man's inability to interpret the world: "The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance" between people and their environment. People construct a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged [[mental image]] of the world, and to a degree, everyone's pseudo-environment is a fiction. People "live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones."

Human behavior is stimulated by the person's pseudo-environment and then is acted upon in the real world. Some of the general implications of the interactions among one's psychology, environment, and the [[mass media|mass communications media]] are highlighted.

==News and truth==
By definition, pertinent facts are never provided completely and accurately; by necessity they are arranged to portray a certain, subjective interpretation of an event. Those who are most familiar with the greatest amount of facts regarding a certain environment, construct a pseudo-environment that aligns with their own 'stereotypes' and convey this to the public, knowingly or not, to suit their own private needs. This is inescapable human nature. [[Propaganda]] is inherently impossible without a barrier of [[censorship]] between the event and the public. As a consequence, the mass communication media, by their very nature as vehicles for informational transmission, are essentially vulnerable to manipulation.

The blame for that perceptual [[parallax]] falls not upon the mass media [[technology]] (print, radio, cinema, or, inferentially, television) or logistical concerns but upon certain members of society who attend to life with little [[intellectualism|intellectual]] engagement. That causes the following:

#The buying public: the "bewildered herd" (a term here borrowed from [[The Phantom Public]]) must pay for understanding the unseen environment by the mass communications media. The irony is that although the public's opinion is important, it must pay for its acceptance. People will be selective and will buy the most factual media at the lowest price: "For a dollar, you may not even get an armful of candy, but for a dollar or less people expect reality/representations of truth to fall into their laps." The media have the social function of transmitting [[public policy|public affairs]] information  and their business [[profit (economics)|profit]] role of surviving in the market.
#Nature of news: people publish already-confirmed news that are thus less disputable. Officially-available public matters will constitute "the news" and unofficial (private) matters are unavailable, are less available, or are used as "issues" for propaganda.
#News truth and conclusion: the function of news is to signal an event, and that signalling, eventually, is a consequence of [[editorial board|editorial]] selection and judgement;  [[journalism]] creates and sows the seeds (news) that establish [[public opinion]].

==Manufacture of consent==&lt;!-- [[Manufacturing Consent (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;

When properly deployed in the [[public interest]], the manufacture of [[consent]] is useful and necessary for a cohesive society, because, in many cases, "the common interests" of the public are not obvious except upon careful analysis of the collected data, a critical intellectual exercise in which most people are uninterested or are incapable of doing. Therefore, most people must have the world summarized for them by the well-informed, and will then act accordingly.

{{Quotation|
That the '''manufacture of consent''' is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough. . . . [a]s a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.... Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self-deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.|Walter Lippmann, ''Public Opinion'', Chapter XV}}

The political élite are members of the class of people who are incapable of accurately understanding, by themselves, the complex "unseen environment" wherein the public affairs of the modern state occur; thus, Lippmann proposes that a professional, "specialized class" collect and analyze data, and present their conclusions to the society's decision makers, who, in their turn, use the "art of persuasion" to inform the public about the decisions and circumstances affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XV, “Leaders and the Rank and File”, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public Opinion'' proposes that the increased power of [[propaganda]] and the specialized knowledge required for effective political decisions have rendered the traditional notion of [[democracy]] impossible. The phrase "manufacture of consent" was introduced, which the [[intellectual|public intellectuals]] [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] used as the title of their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' (1988).

{{good article}}
{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A '''Robinson Crusoe economy''' is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title "[[Robinson Crusoe]]" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by [[Daniel Defoe]] in 1719.

As a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of [[consumer behaviour]], producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in [[public finance]] the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of [[public goods]] and certain aspects of collective benefits.&lt;ref name="pubfin"/&gt; It is used in [[growth economics]] to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.&lt;ref name="barro"/&gt;

In the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt; The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, [[Man Friday]]. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of [[Pareto Efficiency]] can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt; 
# The island is cut off from the rest of the world (and hence cannot trade)
# There is only a single economic agent (Crusoe himself)
# All commodities on the island have to be produced or found from existing stocks

==Framework==
[[File:Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=The Robinson Crusoe Economy framework|Figure 1: Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.]]
Robinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.
{{Clear }}

==Production function and indifference curves==
Crusoe's [[indifference curves]] depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the [[production function]] depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function,&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; figure 2 can be drawn:

[[File:The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2: The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves]]

The production function is [[Concave function|concave]] in two dimensions and [[Quasiconvex function|quasi-convex]] in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.

Recall that the [[Marginal rate of substitution]] is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Additionally, an input's marginal product  is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Then,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal Product of Labour,''' and

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts'''

{{Clear}}

==Crusoe's multifaceted role==
Suppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two [[collectively exhaustive]] markets, the coconut market and the labour market.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole [[shareholder]]. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; Let's assume that a currency called "Dollars" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = $1.00'''. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to [[Numéraire]] commodities.

===Producer===
{{Main|Production theory}}

[[File:Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3: Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

Assume that when the firm produces ''C'' amount of total coconuts, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is ''w'', L amount of labour will be employed. Then,

&lt;math&gt;\Pi=C - wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=\Pi + wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

The above function describes iso-profit lines (the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production).&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Symbolically,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

Graphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;''' is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a [[dividend]] of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

{{Clear }}

===Consumer===
{{Main|Consumer choice}}

[[File:Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 4: Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve]]

As a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;  Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:

Note that labour is assumed to be a '[[bad (economics)|bad]]', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.

Notice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of ''w'' and passes through the point '''(0,Π)'''. This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

{{Clear }}

==Equilibrium==

[[File:Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

At equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt;

Graphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Notice that,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

-=&gt; '''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'''

This ensures that the slopes of the indifference curves and the production set are the same.

As a result, Crusoe ends up consuming at the same point he would have if he made all the above decisions together. In other words, using the market system has the same outcome as choosing the individual utility maximisation and cost minimisation plans.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This is an important result when put into a macro level perspective because it implies that there exists a set of prices for inputs and outputs in the economy such that the profit-maximising behaviour of firms along with the utility-maximizing actions of individuals results in the demand for each good equaling the supply in all markets. This means that a
competitive equilibrium can exist. The merit of a competitive equilibrium is that an efficient allocation of resources is achievable.&lt;ref name="HRV"/&gt; In other words, no economic agent can be made better off without making another economic agent worse off.&lt;ref name="vijay"/&gt;

==Production possibilities with two goods==
{{Main|Production-possibility frontier}}
Let's assume that there is another commodity that Crusoe can produce apart from coconuts, for example, fish. Now, Robinson has to decide how much time to spare for both activities, i.e. how many coconuts to gather and how many fish to hunt.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; The locus of the various combinations of fish and coconuts that he can produce from devoting different amounts of time to each activity is known as the production possibilities set.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This is depicted in the figure 6:

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy with two commodities.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Production possibilities with two goods|Figure 6: Production possibilities set in the Robinson Crusoe economy with two commodities.]]

The boundary of the production possibilities set is known as the Production-possibility frontier (PPF).&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This curve measures the feasible outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

It is crucial to note that the shape of the PPF depends on the nature of the technology in use.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Here, technology refers to the type of [[returns to scale]] prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances:
# If the technology for gathering coconuts and hunting fish exhibits constant returns to scale
# If there is only one input in production

So in the Robinson Crusoe economy, the PPF will be linear due to the presence of only one input.

===Marginal rate of transformation===
{{Main|Marginal rate of transformation}}
Suppose that Crusoe can produce 4 pounds of fish or 8 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he devotes L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to fish gathering and L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to gathering coconuts, he will produce 4L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of fish and 8L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of coconuts. Suppose that he decides to work for 12 hours a day. Then the production possibilities set will consist of all combinations of fish, F, and coconuts, C, such that

&lt;math&gt;F=4L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=8L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve the first two equations and substitute in the third to get,

&lt;math&gt;F/4 + C/8=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents Crusoe's PPF. The slope of this PPF measures the [[Marginal rate of transformation]] (MRT), i.e., how much of the first good must be given up in order to increase the production of the second good by one unit. If Crusoe works one hour less on hunting fish, he will have 4 less fish. If he devotes this extra hour to collecting coconuts, he will have 8 extra coconuts. The MRT is thus,

'''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;'''
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -8/4=-2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparative advantage===
{{Main|Comparative advantage}}
Under this section, the possibility of trade is introduced by adding another person to the economy. Suppose that the new worker who is added to the Robinson Crusoe Economy has different skills in gathering coconuts and hunting fish.&lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; The second person is called "Friday".

Friday can produce 8 pounds of fish or 4 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he too decides to work for 12 hours, his production possibilities set will be determined by the following relations:

&lt;math&gt;F=8L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=4L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=&gt;F/8 + C/4=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,''' MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''' 
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -4/8=-1/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for every pound of coconuts Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.

So, we can say that Friday has a Comparative advantage &lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; in hunting fish while Crusoe has a comparative advantage in gathering coconuts. Their respective PPFs can be shown in the following diagram:

[[File:Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|550px|500px|alt=Comparative Advantage||Figure 7: Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe economy.]]

The joint production possibilities set at the extreme right shows the total amount of both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.

If we want more fish, we should shift that person who has a comparative advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, the slope of the joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Pareto efficiency==
{{Main|Pareto efficiency}}
Assume that there are '''''c''''' units of coconut and '''''f''''' units of fish available for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle '''''(c,f)''''', the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the [[Edgeworth box]] along the Pareto Set ([[Contract curve]]). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's [[Marginal rate of substitution]] are equal.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
In a simple exchange economy, the contract curve describes the set of bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is another way to exchange goods – to produce less of one good and more of the other.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 8: Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box showing a Pareto Efficient situation within]]

From the figure 8, it is clear that an economy operating at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be [[Pareto efficient]]. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a way to make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

Thus for Pareto Efficiency,

'''''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = '''''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

(''for both Crusoe and Friday'')

This can be achieved in a competitive market by decentralising production and consumption decisions, i.e. Crusoe and Friday will both solve their own problems of how much to consume and produce independently.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">'''SEETEP''' stands for  Solar Energy and Environmental Education Program. It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the [[Nyanza Province]]  of Kenya. Its purpose is to build  a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"About Seetep", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=4, Retrieved  2012-03-08,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

Since 1992 [[Arc Aid and Arc Kenya|ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya]] have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;"ARO Development Centre", http://www.arc-aid.no/aro-development-centre/, Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011530/http://www.elkem.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=241 Elkem Solar]. Elkem installed solar panels in  ARO Development Centre which is  very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously  carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.

ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with [http://www.kvadraturen.vgs.no/ Kvadraturen School](also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in [https://www.google.no/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kisumu+polytechnic Kisumu Polytechnic] a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

[[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] is funding the project as part of their development activities. [http://www.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=8&amp;amid=59171 Vest-Agder County Municipality] has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.

==Progress==

In 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;"Seetep Progress", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=7,Retrieved 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.

In [[linguistics]], '''semantic overload''' occurs when a word or phrase has more than one meaning, and is used in ways that convey meaning based on its divergent constituent concepts. Semantic overload is related to the linguistic concept of [[polysemy]]. Overloading is related to the psychological concept of [[information overload]], and the computer science concept of an [[overloaded expression]]. A term that is semantically overloaded is a kind of "overloaded expression" in language that causes a certain small degree of "information overload" in the receiving audience.

An example of this is the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''herri'' which can be translated as ''nation; country, land; people, population''; and ''town, village, settlement'',&lt;ref name=Aulestia&gt;Aulestia, G. ''Basque-English Dictionary'' (1989) [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] Press {{ISBN|0-87417-126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other things leading to difficulties in translating the indigenous term [[Euskal herria#Etymology|Euskal Herria]]. Another example is the term ''memory'', especially as used in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David C.|date=2005-02-15|title=The Abuses of Memory: Reflections on the Memory Boom in Anthropology|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/178196|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=78|issue=1|pages=197–211|doi=10.1353/anq.2005.0001|issn=1534-1518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Profanity|Expletive]]s are also notable for this quality, and conversely this quality is also a contributor to why such terms may be regarded as crude or inappropriate.

Meanings associated with a semantically overloaded word have different qualities: those the word itself [[reference|refers directly]] to, and other meanings [[Inference|inferred]] from its use in [[Context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|date=1971-01-01|title=Semantic Overloading: A Restudy of the Verb Remind|jstor=412376|journal=Language|volume=47|issue=3|pages=522–547|doi=10.2307/412376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language planning==
Minority languages that spread into new domains frequently suffer from semantic overloading by attempting to adapt existing terms to cover new concepts. One such example from [[Scottish Gaelic]] is the over-use of the word ''comhairle'' (originally "advice, counsel") for concepts such as ''committee'', ''council'', and ''consultation'' as exemplified by Donald MacAulay in ''dh'iarr a' chomhairle comhairle air a’ chomhairle chomhairleachaidh'': "The committee sought advice from the consultative council"—a sentence that is opaque in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Wilson ''Faclair na Pàrlamaid, a critical evaluation'' (2001) Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacAulay, Donald ''New Gaelic'' (1986) Scottish Language, 5, 120-25&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">'''Sociomapping''' is a method developed for [[data analysis|processing]] and [[Information visualization|visualization]] of relational data (e.g. social network data). It is most commonly used for mapping the social structure within small teams (10-25 people). Sociomapping uses the landscape metaphor to display complex multi-dimensional data in a 3D [[map]], where individual objects are localized in such way that their distance on the map corresponds to their distance in the underlying data.

Thanks to its visual coding Sociomapping engages our evolved skills for [[spatial orientation]] and [[movement detection]], thus making the interpretation of complex data easy and accessible for everyone.

==History==
The sociomapping method was developed in 1993-1994 by R. Bahbouh as a tool that would facilitate understanding of data about social relations and help preventing conflicts within teams of military professionals. The first major application of sociomapping took place in 1994-1995 during the HUBES experiment (Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight) – a 135-day-long simulation of a spaceflight with three crew members organized by [[European Space Agency]]. Sociomapping was then regularly used in other spaceflight simulations (1995-1996: EKOPSY, 1999: Mars105, 2010-2012: [[Mars500]]). Since 2005, sociomapping has been extensively used in business environment to analyze relationships within senior management teams. In 2012, C. Höschl jr. developed Real Time Sociomapping®
software that enables customers to do team sociomapping on the spot and is used for commercial purposes.

==Basic principle==
The basic principle of Sociomapping is transforming original data concerning a set of objects in such a way that the distance of each pair of objects on the map corresponds to the distance between the two objects in the underlying data. Transformation of the data is a matter of 1) choosing some metric that could be reasonably interpreted as distance, and 2) translating the multi-dimensional distance matrix into 2D coordinate system so that the correlation between map-distances and data-distances is maximized. 
The algorithm for data-transformation, developed by C. Höschl jr., is thus a [[Dimensionality reduction|dimensionality-reduction]] technique, such as [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], and its goodness of fit can be measured by [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman correlation]] between the map-distances and data-distances. 
Sociomapping takes into account that, particularly in case of social relations, relational data may be asymmetrical (e.g. John like Mary more than she likes him) and preserves this information by mapping the objects in such a way that for each object the closest other object is the one closest to it according to the metric of choice in the underlying data, and so on for other objects ordered by distance.

==Application==
There are two main areas of application for Sociomapping – groups (small systems) and populations (large systems). For each area a different method of visualization and data transformation is used in order to facilitate people’s ability to understand and interpret the analyzed data.

===Groups and small systems===
Sociomapping for small systems produces Sociomaps of subjects. These subjects (in most cases people) are placed on the Sociomap reflecting their distance measured in various ways:
* [[social distance]]
* psychological distance (psychological similarity)
* communication distance
* other relation measures

Besides the distances between the group members, Sociomap shows additional variable coded in the height (or color) of the subject. Typical variables used for the height are: social status, [[Key performance indicators|performance indicators]] of the subjects, average communication frequency, etc.

Understanding the relative distances between the people helps to understand the structure of the group, find subgroups formed by groups members and discover functions of the group members. In connection to the height Sociomap enables complex and comprehensive insight into the groups and small systems.

Sociomapping of small systems produces similar results to [[social network analysis]] with additional visualization features.

===Profile analysis===
Besides the small systems analysis based on various relational data, Sociomapping can be used to visualize the profiles of unrelated subjects. This is done by transformation of profiles of the subjects, computing the distances between the profiles and visualizing them in a Sociomap.
There is a software to compute Profile analysis (see section Sociomapping software)

===Populations and large systems===
For large systems and populations, different type of Sociomaps is used. Data used for these type of maps are rectangular [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], where for each subject there is a [[preference vector]] of selected objects (such as [[political parties]], [[brands]], [[Product (business)|products]], and so on). 
In order to create a Sociomap, for each subject a position in the map is determined, and a small piece of mass representing this subject is placed on the map according to its vector of preferences to an object.  As a result, there are places on the Sociomap where more subject are placed (hills) and where there are no subject (valleys). Therefore, hills are formed on the places representing typical preference configurations and this allows for visual cluster analysis, or segmentation.
In this sense, Large systems Sociomapping is a [[data mining]] approach based on visual [[pattern recognition]]).

Typical uses for Large systems Sociomapping are:
* [[Political science|political research]] (preferences and polls)
* [[marketing research]] (attitudes and product preferences)
* [[customer segmentation]] (behavioral patterns)
* and other research concerned with preferences and/or attitudes.

==Broader scope of application==
Sociomapping has broader scope of application, including the following fields:

*Historical events analysis (e.g.  [[RMS Titanic]] survival rate)
*[[Internet community]] tools (e.g.  [[Last.fm]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081705/http://qed-portal.com/en/last_fm/tool/] profile similarity)
*[[Literature]] analysis (e.g.  analysis of communication in [[Shakespeare plays]])
*[[Military]] units and [[human spaceflight]] crews analysis
*[[Sport]] analysis and forecast (e.g. cooperation of sport teams)
*[[Politics]] analysis and forecast
*[[Team building]]
*Team analysis (communication, cooperation, decision-making)

==Software==

So far only one software tool based on Sociomapping was released.

'''Team profile analyzer''' [http://www.teamprofileanalyzer.com/] is a tool for psychologists, consultants, managers and HR specialists. It enables integration of various sources of information about team from personality, performance or knowledge [[psychological testing|tests]] and biographical data. It can be used for team analysis and development: team coaching, [[team building]], [[recruitment]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12824">'''Teaching writing in the United States''' has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States.

== Background ==

At its most basic level, writing is how people keep track of the thoughts that are important to them. From the ancient [[Egyptians]], to the monks of the Middle Ages, to [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], writing has been used to capture thought, from the mundane to the profound.&lt;ref&gt;The Vermont Writing Collaborative: ''Writing for Understanding'', pp 4–5.  Authentic Education, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In schools, writing serves not only to record and convey thoughts, but to refine and synthesize thinking. As school effectiveness researcher Doug Reeves discovered, "The association between writing and performance in other academic disciplines [is] striking, and gets to the heart of the curriculum choices teachers must make."&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Douglas:  ''Accountability in Action—A Blueprint for Learning'', pp. 189–90.  Advanced Learning Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early writing instruction ==

Early academic instruction in writing centered almost exclusively on mechanics, commonly referred to today as [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. Emphasis was placed on handwriting, grammar, punctuation and spelling. Papers were more likely to be graded on conformity to these conventions and accuracy of content than on style or creative expression of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Literacy: Writing and Composition." Encyclopedia of Education. The Gale Group, Inc, 2002. Answers.com 30 Jan. 2010. [http://www.answers.com/topic/literacy-writing-and-composition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, instruction in writing has focused on a narrow pool of concrete, easily definable skills.

== Writing process approach ==

Research conducted in the late 1970s by [[Donald Graves]], Janet Emig and others led to a focus on the process, rather than solely the product, of writing.&lt;ref&gt;National Writing Project and Carl Nagin: ''Because Writing Matters'', p. 22, Jossey-Bass,2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[writing process]] approach rests on the premise that writing is a complex and individualized task which can be described through a series of [[Recursion|recursive]] stages.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D: ''Write to Learn'', pp. 5–6, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; These stages, commonly including pre-writing, writing, editing and revision, and the concepts of craft within them, can be modeled and taught to students. This allows the teacher to identify the difficulties students are having with writing and to provide appropriate instruction and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Institute for Writing and Rhetoric|url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/materials/tutor/pedagogy/process.html|website = www.dartmouth.edu|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The writing process approach helps students to understand what writers actually do when they write, providing multiple models and individual feedback on writing pieces in progress. Students are encouraged to choose their own topics and purposes for writing, and to write to real audiences. This approach has been widely adopted in schools throughout the United States.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A new way to have students write is to work together – known as collaborative writing. There are many criticisms against collaborative writing and many people are uncomfortable with it. Darolyn Jones, author of ''Collaborative Writing: Priority, Practice and Process'', says that many people work alone for several reasons. The first one is that many people cannot find time to meet with the rest of the group. Another reason is that each writer has their organization and own process of writing. When students are forced to work with others, they must adjust to the style of the group and get rid of their own. Many times there is a misunderstanding of what is expected of the students. The last reason, and the biggest one, is the fear of being criticized. Many writers do not feel comfortable sharing their work because they are afraid it will be torn down and disliked by readers and their audience.

Despite these issues, there are several benefits to collaborative writing. Collaboration results in a stronger finished product.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Each member can contribute their own strengths for the assignment. Working together allows students to mentor each other and practice working with one another, which will help them in the real world when they go out for their job. While the project may seem daunting, working together allows the burden to be shared and there are more eyes for editing the final project.

== Writing across the curriculum ==

During the 1980s and 1990s, new approaches to teaching writing emerged, as teachers realized that in order to be effective, a piece of writing should be tailored to a specific purpose and audience. Prominent among these was the British-based movement which came to be known as [[Writing Across the Curriculum]]. This approach rests on the premise that all teachers, not just [[language arts]] teachers, must be teachers of writing.  Designed to ease the separation between [[literacy]] and content knowledge, this approach emphasizes the connection between writing and cognitive development, teaching students to write in a variety of genres, specific to purpose and discipline. Writing Across the Curriculum teachers often emphasize two basic pedagogical strands:  Writing to Learn, informal writing done to prompt students to more deeply understand concepts; and Writing in the Disciplines, in which students are taught writing skills and conventions necessary to participate in specific academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bazerman, Joseph Little, Lisa Bethel, Teri Chavkin, Danielle Fouquette, and Janet Garufis: ''Reference Guide to Writing Across the Curriculum''. Parlor Press and the WAC Clearinghouse,2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing for understanding ==

''Writing for understanding'', a 21st-century approach, adapts the principles of [[backward design]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Grant &amp; McTighe, Jay:  ''The Understanding by Design Handbook'', ASCD, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; to teach students to write effectively. Writing for Understanding grew out of a recognition that most students require explicit instruction in both the knowledge and the structures that they need to construct meaning in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Think Before You Write|journal=Educational Leadership|date=October 2006|first=Joanna|last=Hawkins|volume=64|issue=2|pages=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral processing and the extensive use of models and modeling are core teaching methodologies in this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristen | last=Fountain | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Fresh Approach Vermont Educators Use New Methods to Teach Writing | date=2008-11-25 | publisher=Valley News | url = | work =Valley News | pages =C2–C3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Writing for Understanding Approach rests on three pillars: Backward Design, Understanding and Direct Instruction.  Students are given focused, intentional instruction and practice in:

* developing a knowledge and understanding which can be articulated in spoken and written language
* identifying an appropriate focus for thinking about and synthesizing that knowledge and understanding
* choosing a structure through which to clearly develop and present that knowledge and understanding
* establishing control over conventions.&lt;ref&gt;The Vermont Writing Collaborative: ''Writing for Understanding'', p.xiii.  Authentic Education, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for understanding teachers intentionally design instruction to enable students to appropriately generalize and transfer their skills to multiple contexts.  The Vermont Writing Collaborative [http://www.vermontwritingcollaborative.org/index.html] serves as a clearinghouse for information about Writing for Understanding and provides professional development, instructional materials and support for educators.

== The reading and apprenticeship connections ==
According to some writing theorists, reading for pleasure provides a more effective way of mastering the art of writing than does a formal study of writing, language, grammar, and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding reading (4th ed.)|last=Smith|first=F.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum.|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of reading|last=Krashen|first=S.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1993|isbn=|location=Englewood, CO|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The writer's mind|last=Hays|first=J.

By watching the master, according to Michael Polanyi,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal knowledge|last=|first=|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1962|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an “apprentice unconsciously picks up the rules of the art, including those which are not explicitly known to the master himself.”  Writing instructors, according to this approach, serve as models and coaches, providing explicit feedback in response to the learner's compositions. Students focus their attention on the task at hand, and not on "an inaccessible and confusing multitude of explicit rules and strategies." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissany|first=M|date=1996|title=The Apprenticeship Approach to Writing Instruction|url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/visiblelanguage/pdf/V30N3_1996_E.pdf|journal=Visible Language|volume=30|issue=3 |pages=284–313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009–present ==

In 2009, the [[National Governors Association]] Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO) assumed the coordination of a state led effort called The Common Core State Standards Initiative.  In this initiative, "Governors and state commissioners of education from 48 states, 2 territories and the District of Columbia committed to developing a common core of state standards in English-language arts."&lt;ref&gt;Common Core State Standards Initiative: [http://www.corestandards.org/], Retrieved 30 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core State Standards Initiative's focus, with regard to writing, is to prepare America's students for college and career writing. These standards indicate key points in English Language Arts Writing through outlining the following main categories: Text Types and Purposes; Production and Distribution of Writing; Research to Build and Present Knowledge; and Range of Writing. These main categories are divided into 10 concepts and skills which are introduced to students in Kindergarten and then built upon in every subsequent grade level. Complexity and rigor increase each year so students develop and master each concept and skill. This effort is ongoing and is certain to have a profound effect nationwide on writing curriculum and pedagogical practice over the next decade. The National Commission on Writing has challenged American public educators "to teach all students to write effectively, clearly and thoughtfully."&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Writing: ''The Neglected 'R':  the Need for a Writing Revolution''. College Entrance Examination Board, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Tonkunst''', literally "The Art of Tone", is an obsolete term in the German language applied for art music of the 19th century, and often used in music history and [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetic]] representations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRQMMHIW6NkC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false The Musician As Entrepreneur, 1700-1914: Managers, Charlatans, and Idealists],'' p. 87, [[Indiana University Press]] (2004), {{ISBN|0253344565}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably originated from the need to give the music a place among the classical arts like [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]], and also recognize the composer or musician as a creative individual.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

A '''turncoat''' is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a [[traitor]], as the switch mostly takes place under the following circumstances:
*In groups, often driven by one or more leaders.
*When the goal that formerly motivated and benefited the person becomes (or is perceived as having become) either [[Unwinnable|no longer feasible]] or [[Pyrrhic victory|too costly even if success is achieved]].

From a military perspective, opposing armies generally wear uniforms of contrasting colors to prevent incidents of [[Friendly fire]].  Thus the term "turn-coat" indicates that an individual has changed sides and his uniform coat to one matching the color of his former enemy.  For example, in the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century, [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army (see '''Examples''' below).

==Historical context==
Even in a modern historical context "turncoat" is often synonymous with the term "[[wikt:renegade|renegade]]", a term of religious origins having its origins in the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''"renegare"'' (to deny). Historical currents of great magnitude have periodically caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in their wake. In such a dire situation new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal treason becomes muddled. One example would be the situation that led to the [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'', signed on July 26, 1581 in the Netherlands, an instance where changing sides was given a positive meaning.

The first written use of the term meaning  was by J. Foxe in ''Actes &amp; Monumentes'' in 1570: "One who changes his principles or party; a renegade; an apostate." Cited 1571*&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] "turncoat, n. and adj." cites "John Foxe · The first volume of the ecclesiasticall history contaynyng the actes and monumentes of thynges passed..in this realme · Rev. ed., 1570 (2 vols.)."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Turncoat" could also have a more literal origin. According to the Rotuli Chartarum 1199–1216 two barons changed fealty from [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]],&lt;ref&gt;David Crouch. 2002. William Marshal. Knighthood, War and Chivalry, 1147–1219. Longman. London&lt;/ref&gt; to [[John, King of England|King John]]. In other words, they turned their coats (of arms) from one lord to another, hence turncoat.

==Process==
A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during [[military occupation]], after a nation has been defeated in [[war]] or after a major social upheaval, such as a [[revolution]]. Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the area in question quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival.

Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to [[Secrecy (sociology)|privileged information]] and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in [[dictatorships]] and [[authoritarian]] states when most of the population has been fed [[propaganda]] and [[triumphalism]] and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.

==Aftermath==
As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of [[Deception|burying and rewriting]] the past by [[Cover-up|concealing evidence]]. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashed]] to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|falsification]] of historical events.

Even after the death of a turncoat his family and friends may wish to keep uncomfortable secrets from the past out of the light. There is a fear of loss of prestige as well as a wish to honor the memory of a family member from the part of those who have experienced the positive side of the person.

In certain countries, individuals and organizations have actively investigated the past to bring turncoats to justice to face their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html Jean-Paul Cointet, ''Epuration légale: 400 000 dossiers, moins de 800 morts''; Historia (fr)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910175241/http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html |date=2004-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
There were many turncoats in:

*The [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century.  The siege of [[Corfe Castle]] was won by [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers when they turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army.&lt;ref&gt;[S03E10 Great British Railway Journeys]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the revolution of the British American colonies when U.S. Continental Army Major General [[Benedict Arnold]] defected to the side of the British in May 1779.
*Canada during the [[War of 1812]]. Some Canadians felt [[republican democracy]] was a better system of government than the [[British Monarchy]] and fought on the side of the invading Americans. Conversely the [[United Empire Loyalists]] left what was to be the United States and moved North to remain under British rule.
*Germany and Austria after World War II when many former enthusiastic members of the [[Nazi Party]] embraced the newly created nations of [[West Germany]] or [[East Germany]] and sought to erase or at least minimize their former role as Nazis. During the  decades that followed many former Nazis regained prestige and held high posts in the new republics. [[Kurt Waldheim]], an Austrian Nazi, even held the highest post at the [[UN]] for a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1934744.ece ''Kurt Waldheim, Austrian head of the UN who as president of his country was later tainted by charges of complicity in Nazi atrocities'', Timesonline&lt;/ref&gt;
*France after the downfall of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], when many [[collaborationists]], whether home-grown [[fascists]] or Nazi sympathizers, played down their role in the former government and its institutions.
*Iran after the overthrow of the last [[Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s regime.

This article is about the role played by '''women in the military in the Americas''', particularly in the [[History of women in the United States|United States]] and [[History of women in Canada|Canada]] from the First World War to modern times.

==Brazil==

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, it was not until 1943, during World War II, that women officially entered the Brazilian Army. They included 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army.  All volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces. After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

In 1992, the School of Army Administration (Salvador - BA) enrolled the first group of 49 women, by conducting tender. And in 1996, Maria Quitéria de Jesus, the Paladina of Independence, was recognized in the army ranks, as Patron of Table Complementary Brazilian Army officers. The Army established the Military Female Volunteer for Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and top-level Nurses (MFDV) in 1996. At that time, they entered the first class of 290 female volunteers to provide military service in healthcare. This merger took place in all twelve military regions of the country. 

In 1997 the Military Institute of Engineering—IME (Rio de Janeiro—RJ) enrolled the first group of 10 women students to be included in Table Military Engineers (QEM). In the same year the School of the Army Health—Essex (Rio de Janeiro RJ) enrolled and graduated the first group of medical officers, dentists, pharmaceutical, veterinary and top-level nurses in the framework of the Army Health.

In 1998, the Army established the Stage Technical Service for higher education professionals than healthcare. At that time, he entered the first class of 519 women lawyers, administrators of businesses, accountants, teachers, computer analysts, engineers, architects, journalists, and other areas of human and exact sciences, serving the needs of Official Temporary Technical (OTT) of Institution. In 2001 the Army Health School allowed the enrollment of women to participate in the public tender for the filling of vacancies in the Health Sergeant Course, which started to operate in 2002.

==Canada==

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. Canadian women were also organized into possible uniformed home guard units, undertaking military training in [[paramilitary]] groups. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada’s part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. These included the standardization of enlistment criteria, equal pay and pensions, and allowing women to enroll in all aspects of the Canadian armed forces and making it possible for women to reach any rank. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]], and four years later the first woman qualified for the Canadian skydiving demonstration team, the Skyhawks.

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. 1981 saw the first female navigator and helicopter pilot, and in 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with no restrictions in place, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada’s first female infantry soldier, first female gunner, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1990 the Ministers Advisory Board on Women in the Canadian Forces was created, and in 1994 Wendy Clay was promoted to [[Major-General]]. In 2000 Major [[Micky Colton]] became the first female to log 5,000 flying hours in a [[C-130 Hercules]]. Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first female submariner in 2003.

Canadian women have also become clearance divers, and commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships.

On May 17, 2006 [[Captain (Canadian army and air force)|Captain]] [[Nichola Goddard]] became the first Canadian woman killed in combat during operations in [[Afghanistan]].

==United States==
[[File:080930-110605 - SGT Lisa Morales awaits turn.jpg|thumb|Two female U.S. Army soldiers in September 2008.]]
One of the first American woman soldiers was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman. Finally, at the end of the hostilities her secret was discovered—even so, [[George Washington]] gave her an [[honorable discharge]]. She later lectured on her experiences and became a champion of [[women's rights]]. Another female soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was  [[Anna Maria Lane]] of [[Virginia]], who enlisted with her husband in 1776 and fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of Germantown]]. &lt;ref&gt;T [https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&amp;q=Anna+Maria+Lane#v=snippet&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Lane&amp;f=false endrich, Lisa Frank, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadway, Sandra Gioia. “Anna Maria Lane: An Uncommon Soldier of the American Revolution.” Virginia Cavalcade 37, no. 3 (1988): 134–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], about 250 women have been found to have enlisted, counting both sides, and specialists believe that the total is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mtsu.edu/tps/Women_and_the_Civil_War.pdf Women and the Civil War], Middle Tennessee State U and Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeAnne Blanton. [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1993/spring/women-in-the-civil-war-1.html Women Soldiers of the Civil War]. ''Prologue Magazine'' 25:1, Spring 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was not generally a crime to for a woman to enlist, but it was considered improper and women only signed up claiming to be men.  For example, [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman. She served in the 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Her complete letters describing her experiences as a female soldier in the Union Army are reproduced in the book, ''An Uncommon Soldier: The Civil War Letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Pvt. Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862–1864''.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, Sarah Rosetta, and Lauren M. Cook. 1994. An uncommon soldier the Civil War letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Private Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Pasadena, Md: The Minerva Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by Annie Oakley to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. [[Annie Oakley]], sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] Show, wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley's offer was not accepted for the [[Spanish–American War]].

In World War I, the first American women enlisted into the regular armed forces were 13,000 women admitted into active duty in the Navy and Marines and a much smaller number admitted into the Coast Guard. The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in clerical positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. These women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.

[[Women's Army Corps|The Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. However, political pressures stalled attempts to create more roles for women in the American Armed Forces. Women saw combat during [[World War II]], first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on December 7, 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]] and [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women’s Reserve]] were also created during this conflict. In July 1943 a bill was signed removing 'auxiliary' from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, making it an official part of the regular army. In 1944 WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War Two and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

After World War Two, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953 many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 during the conflict.

Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

The [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]] began accepting female missile technicians in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/women_chron/chron1970s.html |title=The Women of Redstone Arsenal |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] missile units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Busse |first=Charlane |date=July 1978 |title=First women join Pershing training |journal=[[Field Artillery (magazine)|Field Artillery Journal]] |publisher=[[United States Army Field Artillery School]] |page=40 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/famag/1978/JUL_AUG_1978/JUL_AUG_1978_PAGES_40_43.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1978 |title=The Journal interviews: 1LT Elizabeth A.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots: [[Jane Skiles O'Dea]], [[Barbara Allen Rainey]], [[Rosemary Bryant Mariner]], [[Judith Neuffer|Judith Ann Neuffer]], Ana Marie Fuqua, and Joellen Drag Oslund. The Congressionally mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933|Ocala Star-Banner August 23, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1990s/1997/mj97/ppp.pdf|Naval Aviation News, May–June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s involvement in [[Grenada]] in 1983 saw over 200 women serving; however, none of these took part in direct combat. Some women, such as Lt Col [[Eileen Collins]] or Lt Celeste Hayes, flew transport aircraft carrying wounded or assault teams, however they were not deemed to have been in direct combat. Several hundred women took part in operations in [[Panama]] in 1989, in non-combat roles.

On December 20, 1989, Capt Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women MPs to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the Panamanian Defense force. From a command center about a half-mile from the kennel she ordered her troops to fire warning shots. The Panamanians returned fire until threatened by artillery attack, fleeing into nearby woods. Bray advanced to the kennel to try to stop them, using the cover of a ditch to reach the building. No enemy dead were found, but a cache of weapons was recovered.

The 1991 [[Gulf War]] brought greater media attention to the role of women in the American armed forces. A senior woman pilot at the time, Colonel Kelly Hamilton, commented that "[t]he conflict was an awakening for the people in the US. They suddenly realised there were a lot of women in the military." Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. They were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Many came under fire, however, and there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Women Were There!]&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that of the USS Mount HOOD, AE-29, Pacific Fleet ammunitions carrier in Battle Group Bravo. The Mt. Hood's sister ship, which was all male, was grounded after hitting a mine. The Mt. Hood, regardless of having at least 32 women on board, the first women to board that class of vessel in the USN, filled in. The women aboard the USS Mt. Hood, AE-29, may be the enlisted Navy's very first CONGRESSIONALLY RECOGNIZED females ordered to combat in a Congressionally declared war. That is not to say that they were the first females in combat because, as above illustrates, women have fought the front lines, whether they were afforded official Congressional recognition for their service or not. At any rate, this small ship tackled her duties and from the women leaders aboard came the first African-American female Admiral in the history of the United States Navy, Admiral and second in command of the United States Navy as Vice Chief of Naval Operations: Admiral Michelle Howard.&lt;ref&gt;MM3 Dorothy D. Meindok, Esq./ USS Mount Hood AE-29 sailor&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:C-130 - First all female crew.jpg|right|thumb|From 2005, the first all female [[C-130 Hercules]] crew to serve a combat mission for the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Michael G. |date=2005-09-27 |url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |title=First All-female Crew Flies Combat Mission |work=DefendAmerica.mil |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Today, women can serve on American combat ships, including in command roles, and on submarines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/us-navy-submarines-women US navy lifts ban on women submariners (''The Guardian'' (UK), 29 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not permitted to participate in special forces programs such as [[Navy SEALs]]. Women enlisted soldiers are barred from serving in Infantry, Special Forces, however female enlisted members and officers can hold staff positions in every branch of the Army except infantry and armor. Women can however serve on the staffs of infantry and armor units at Division level and above, and be members of Special Operations Forces. Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. military. Although Army regulations ban women from infantry assignments, some females are detailed to accompany male infantry units to handle searches of Iraqi women.

[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|left|thumb|[[Jessica Lynch]] after being rescued in 2003]]
The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the Virginia Military Institute allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting J. Ruth Bader Ginsburg) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.”

During [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] in 2003, American soldiers [[Shoshana Johnson]], the first African-American and first Hispanic female prisoner of war, and [[Jessica Lynch]] were captured while serving in Iraq. In the same action, [[Lori Piestewa]], a U.S. soldier, died after driving her Humvee through enemy fire in an attempt to escape an ambush, earning a Purple Heart. She had just rescued Jessica Lynch, whose vehicle had crashed.

Also in 2003, Major [[Kim Campbell (pilot)|Kim Campbell]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for landing her combat damaged [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over [[Baghdad]].

In a recent scandal, U.S Army Reservists [[Lynndie England]] and [[Sabrina Harman]] were convicted by [[court martial]] of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|cruelty and maltreatment of prisoners]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

[[File:Leigh Ann Hester medal.jpg|thumb|upright|SGT [[Leigh Ann Hester]], awarded the [[Silver Star]] for direct combat]]
SGT Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest US decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. Female medical personnel had been awarded the same medal, but not for actual combat. She was a team leader of [[Raven 42]], a [[Military Police]] squad that broke up an ambush roughly three to four times its strength. Specialist Ashley Pullen received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. The squad leader, SSG Timothy Nein, had originally received the Silver Star, but his award was later upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. SGT Jason Mike, the unit's medic, also received the Silver Star.
