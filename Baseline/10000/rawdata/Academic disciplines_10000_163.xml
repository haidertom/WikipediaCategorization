The purpose of this is to provide an open standard, [[Ethernet]] based approach to the networking of linear (uncompressed) digital audio with extremely high quality-of-service alongside standard [[Internet Protocol]] connections.

This standard specifies a method, also known as "ATM-E", of carrying [[asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM) cells over hardware specified for [[IEEE 802.3]] (Ethernet). It is intended as a companion standard to [[AES47]] (Transmission of digital audio over ATM networks), to provide a standard method of carrying ATM cells and real-time clock over hardware specified for Ethernet.

The '''abyssal zone''' or '''abyssopelagic zone''' is a layer of the [[pelagic zone]] of the ocean. "Abyss" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄβυσσος}}, meaning bottomless. At depths of {{convert|4000|to|6000|m|ft}}, this zone remains in perpetual darkness. These regions are also characterized by continuous cold and lack of nutrients. The abyssal zone has temperatures around {{convert|2|to|3|C|F}} through the large majority of its mass.&lt;ref name="biome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Sea Biome |url=http://www.untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |publisher=Untamed Science |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095054/http://untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |archivedate=31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the deeper part of the ''midnight zone'' which starts in the [[bathyal zone|bathypelagic]] waters above.&lt;ref name="biome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |last=Nelson |first=Rob |url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |publisher=The Wild Classroom |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100618/http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |archivedate=25 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area below the abyssal zone is the sparsely inhabited [[hadal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418044525/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |archivedate=18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone above is the [[bathyal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"/&gt;

==Trenches==
{{main|Hadal zone}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|200px|left|Layers of the pelagic zone]]

The deep trenches or fissures that plunge down thousands of metres below the ocean floor (for example, the midoceanic trenches such as the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific]]) are almost unexplored.&lt;ref name=zone/&gt; Previously, only the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'', the [[teleoperated|remote control]] [[submarine]] ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaikō]]'' and the ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' have been able to descend to these depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bathyscaph Trieste|url=http://www.bathyscaphtrieste.com/|publisher=Bathyscaphtrieste.com|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's deepest-diving submarine missing|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-07-01-Sub-missing_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company Inc.|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 25, 2012 one vehicle, the ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'' was able to penetrate to a depth of 10,898.4 metres (35,756&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Biology==

Overall, the deep sea is a very food-limited environment. In the abyssal zone, biomass is directly related to the amount of food either supplied from transporting [[ocean currents]] or from the water column above. The [[biological pump]] is thought of as the main driver for cycling organic matter (e.g. particulate organic carbon or [[dissolved organic carbon]]) from the atmosphere into the surface ocean, and eventually to the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|title=Temporal Change in Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosystems: A Review of the Evidence From Recent Time-Series Studies|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|date=2010|volume=58|pages=10–12|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(10)58001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that organisms in the abyssal zone have no access to sunlight, they rely heavily on nutrients sinking from above (known as [[marine snow]]). These nutrients can be in the form of sediments, algae, fecal pellets, or fish carcasses, to name a few. Spatially, the abundance of organisms in the deep ocean is hypothesized to be highest where the surface productivity is the highest, as long as there is efficient export from surface ocean to deep ocean. Studies have shown that marine snow alone does not supply an adequate amount of nutrients to support the population of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]]. However, population booms of algae or animals near the surface ocean can result in heavy pulses of [[particulate organic matter]] that, in a few weeks, will deliver as many nutrients as would normally be delivered over decadal timescales of marine snow transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine biology: Feast and famine on the abyssal plain|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131111185518.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea floor locations, such as [[mid-ocean ridges]], are unique in that they contain [[hydrothermal vents]]. These vents emit geothermically reduced sulfur compounds that allow for microbial [[primary production]], sustaining many benthic organisms in absence of the sunlight required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karl|first1=D.M.|last2=Wirsen|first2=C.O.|last3=Jannasch|first3=H.W.|title=Deep-sea primary production at the Galapagos hydrothermal vents|journal=Science|date=March 21, 1980|volume=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Excerpt from CDC 2003 Table 1.pdf|thumb|right|2003 US mortality ([[life table|life]]) table, Table 1, Page 1]]'''Actuarial science''' is the discipline that applies [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[statistics|statistical]] methods to [[Risk assessment|assess risk]] in [[insurance]], [[finance]] and other industries and professions. [[Actuary|Actuaries]] are professionals who are qualified in this field through intense education and experience. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations.

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including [[mathematics]], [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[finance]], [[economics]], and [[computer science]]. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of [[stochastic]] actuarial models with modern financial theory {{harv|Frees|1990}}.

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States {{harv|Needleman|2010}}. The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. A similar study by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 2006 included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future {{harv|Nemko|2006}}.

==Life insurance, pensions and healthcare==
Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, [[life insurance]], and annuities. These long term coverages required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This led to the development of an important actuarial concept, referred to as the [[present value]] of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern [[financial economics]].

* In traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of [[mortality rate|mortality]], the production of [[life table]]s, and the application of [[interest|compound interest]] to produce life insurance, annuities and endowment policies. Contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance, [[key person insurance]] for small businesses, [[long term care insurance]] and [[Medical savings account|health savings accounts]] {{harv|Hsiao|2001}}.
* In health insurance, including insurance provided directly by employers, and social insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, fertility and other contingencies. The effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures, and the utilization of drugs and therapies, is also of great importance. These factors underlay the development of the Resource-Base Relative Value Scale ([[RBRVS]]) at Harvard in a multi-disciplined study {{harv|Hsiao|2004}}. Actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures, reimbursement standards, and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare {{harv|CHBRP|2004}}.
* In the pension industry, actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, [[collective bargaining]]; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] in the United States.
* In social welfare programs, the [[Office of the Chief Actuary]] (OCACT), [[Social Security Administration]] plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the [[Social Security (United States)|Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund]] and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, survivorship, marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.

==Applied to other forms of insurance==
Actuarial science is also applied to [[Property insurance|property]], [[Casualty insurance|casualty]], [[Liability insurance|liability]], and [[general insurance]]. In these forms of insurance, coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as a yearly). Coverage can be cancelled at the end of the period by either party.

[[Property insurance|Property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies tend to specialize because of the complexity and diversity of risks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One division is to organize around personal and commercial lines of insurance. Personal lines of insurance are for individuals and include fire, auto, homeowners, theft and umbrella coverages. Commercial lines address the insurance needs of businesses and include property, business continuation, product liability, fleet/commercial vehicle, workers compensation, fidelity &amp; surety, and [[Directors and officers liability insurance|D&amp;O]] insurance. The insurance industry also provides coverage for exposures such as catastrophe, weather-related risks, earthquakes, patent infringement and other forms of corporate espionage, terrorism, and "one-of-a-kind" (e.g., satellite launch). Actuarial science provides data collection, measurement, estimating, forecasting, and valuation tools to provide financial and underwriting data for management to assess marketing opportunities and the nature of the risks. Actuarial science often helps to assess the overall risk from catastrophic events in relation to its underwriting capacity or surplus.

In the [[reinsurance]] fields, actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements, and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes.

==Development==

===Pre-formalization===
Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions arose in antiquity {{harv|Thucydides}}. Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund—the precursor to [[Mutual insurance|mutual insurance companies]] {{harv|Johnston|1932|loc=§475–§476}}. Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society {{harv|Loan|1992}}. However, many of these earlier forms of surety and aid would often fail due to lack of understanding and knowledge {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}.

===Initial development===
The 17th century was a period of advances in mathematics in Germany, France and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently of each other, [[compound interest]] was studied and [[probability theory]] emerged as a well-understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London [[draper]] named [[John Graunt]], who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original [[life table]]. One could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was [[Edmond Halley]] (of [[Halley's comet]] fame). Halley constructed his own life table, and showed how it could be used to calculate the [[Insurance|premium]] amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life annuity {{harv|Halley|1693}}.

===Early actuaries===
[[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]]'s pioneering work on the long term insurance contracts under which the same premium is charged each year led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]]) in London in 1762 {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=38}}. Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 200 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word "actuary" for its chief executive officer in 1762 {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=235}}. Previously, "actuary" meant an official who recorded the decisions, or "acts", of ecclesiastical courts {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}. Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=166}}.

===Technological advances===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, calculations were performed without computers. The calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible, for example "commutation functions" (essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities) {{harv|Slud|2006}}. Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards {{harv|Hickman|2004|p=4}}. However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 20th century. The 1920 revision for the New-York based National Council on Workmen's Compensation Insurance rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries {{harv|Michelbacher|1920|pp=224, 230}}. In the 1930s and 1940s, the mathematical foundations for [[stochastic]] processes were developed {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=168}}. Actuaries could now begin to estimate losses using models of random events, instead of the [[deterministic]] methods they had used in the past. The introduction and development of the computer further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to current high-speed devices, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has rapidly improved, while still being heavily dependent on the assumptions input into the models, and actuaries needed to adjust to this new world {{harv|MacGinnitie|1980|pp=50–51}}.

===Actuarial science related to modern financial economics===
Traditional actuarial science and modern [[financial economics]] in the US have different practices, which is caused by 1) different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies and 2) different regulations.

Regulations are from the [[Armstrong investigation of 1905]], the [[Glass–Steagall Act of 1932]], the adoption of the [[Mandatory Security Valuation Reserve]] by the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]], which cushioned market fluctuations, and the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], (FASB) in the US and Canada, which regulates pensions valuations and funding.

====History====
Historically, much of the foundation of actuarial theory predated modern financial theory. In the early twentieth century, actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition {{harv|Whelan|2002}}.

As a result, actuarial science developed along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, as opposed to the [[arbitrage-free]] [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|risk-neutral valuation]] concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the [[asset allocation]] mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]] assumption). This concept is inconsistent with [[financial economics]].

The potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|pp=169–171}}. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models {{harv|D’Arcy|1989}}. Ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking, and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance {{harv|Economist|2006}}. Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory {{harv|Feldblum|2001|pp=8–9}}. However, assumption-dependent concepts are still widely used (such as the setting of the discount rate assumption as mentioned earlier), particularly in North America.

Product design adds another dimension to the debate. Financial economists argue that pension benefits are bond-like and should not be funded with equity investments without reflecting the risks of not achieving expected returns. But some pension products do reflect the risks of unexpected returns. In some cases, the pension beneficiary assumes the risk, or the employer assumes the risk. The current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles:
# financial models should be free of arbitrage
# assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price. This is at odds with [[FASB]]
# the value of an asset is independent of its financing
# the final issue deals with how pension assets should be invested

Essentially, financial economics state that pension assets should not be invested in equities for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons {{harv|Moriarty|2006}}.

===Actuaries in criminal justice===
There is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance, pensions, etc. One notable example is the use in some US states of actuarial models to set criminal sentencing guidelines. These models attempt to predict the chance of re-offending according to rating factors which include the type of crime, age, educational background and ethnicity of the offender {{harv|Silver|Chow-Martin|2002}}. However, these models have been open to criticism as providing justification for discrimination against specific ethnic groups by law enforcement personnel.  Whether this is statistically correct or a self-fulfilling correlation remains under debate {{harv|Harcourt|2003}}.

Another example is the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and associated tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static-99, and SORAG, have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free {{harv|Nieto|Jung|2006|pp=28–33}}.

When a member died, a stated sum was drawn from the treasury for his funeral....If the purpose of the society was the building of a columbārium, the cost was first determined and the sum total divided into what we should call shares (sortēs virīlēs), each member taking as many as he could afford and paying their value into the treasury.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5785">'''Anneliese Bulling''' (born April 21, 1900 in Ellwürden, Wesermarch (today known as [[Lower Saxony]]), died February 9, 2004 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]), also known as '''Anneliese Gutkind''', was a German&amp;ndash;American art historian specializing in [[Chinese art]] and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]].

== Life ==
Anneliese Bulling came from a wealthy, long-established and well-educated German landowning family. She lived with her father, Henry Bulling (1858&amp;ndash;1940), a banker, and her mother, Anna Umbsen (1867&amp;ndash;1955).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/wesermarsch/kultur/zeitgeschichte-mit-ganz-persoenlicher-note_a_1,0,478925174.html|title = Time history with a personal touch, Historian Vonderach written documentation "from Ellwürden to Hampstead"|date = May 14, 2009|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Hartfil|first = Norbert|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, she had a short-lived marriage to a farmer that was soon declared invalid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/politik/niedersachsen/deutsch-englische-erlebnisse_a_1,0,604194649.html|title = German-English experiences, Anneliese Bulling|date = June 18, 2011|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zietung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Welp|first = Jörgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her failed first marriage, Bulling went off to study Art History and Chinese Studies in [[Berlin]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] (now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) under [[Erich Haenisch]] and Brinkmann.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1935 she graduated with a degree in Chinese Architecture, and in the same year emigrated to [[London]] with her partner, the Jewish architect [[Erwin Gutkind]].{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1946 she found work as a research scholar at the [[Universities’ China Committee in London|Universities China Committee]] and then in 1947 in Cambridge at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]], where she received a PhD, the subject of her dissertation being ''Representational Art in the [[Han period|Han Period]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/14-4/Bulling.pdf|title = Archaeological Excavation in China 1946-1966|last = |first = |date = Summer 1972|journal = UPENN Expedition Magazine|accessdate = May 23, 2014|doi = |volume=14 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulling's research focus was Chinese art history, especially architecture and arts and crafts. She developed a theory that the Chinese characters are the result of prehistoric ([[Neolithic]]) astronomical calendar symbols.{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1956, Bulling and Gutkind married and emigrated to the United States for his professorship at the University of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1964 she joined Dr. Stackler's translation project, translating many Chinese books, and in 1966 she was promoted to Research Associate for Chinese Art and Archaeology at [[Columbia University]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her husband died in 1968.

Bulling died in 2004 at the age of 103 years. She had left the [[Oldenburg Municipal Museum]] an extensive collection of letters of correspondence from 1928&amp;ndash;1946 (around 4,200 letters and postcards), was the inspiration for the 2009 book, ''From Ellwürden to Hampstead. The letters of the Oldenburg emigrant Anneliese Bulling.

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

== Programs ==

=== Recurring Annual Programs ===
* Four-to-Six: Stephen Avenue Walk is transformed into an entertaining daily exhibit full of hands-on encounters with robots, music, street experiments, edible anatomy, science busking, and a variety of artists and performers.
* Beakerbites (formerly Engineered Eats): Food and drink meet science at participating restaurants and bars featuring Beakerhead-themed creations. Themes: [http://old.beakerhead.com/engineered-eats-2/ Eggs] (2015), [https://beakerhead.com/index.php?cID=591 Milk] (2016), [https://beakerhead.com/events/engineered-eats Barley] (2017) and Canola [https://beakerhead.com/media-archives/stories/2018-program-launch] (2018).

=== Beakerhead Big Bang Program ===
Beakerhead Big Bang is an interactive public art proposal and residency program that helps support the creation of new artwork, which will debut in Calgary during the five-day long Beakerhead event every September. The program invites artists, architects, scientists, and other creative professionals to propose an interactive public art installation that incorporates science, technology, and collective experience. The selected project will be funded by Beakerhead and built in Calgary over the course of a year, beginning with a weeklong planning residency hosted at [[Banff Centre|Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity]].

The inaugural Big Bang Residency was awarded to the BASS SHIP by Beama.The BASS Ship, which stands for Beama Applied Sciences Sector Ship, is a 30-foot high interactive audio-visual spaceship that invites participants to explore ideas about non-verbal communication, culture, and civilization.

=== School Programs ===
Beakerhead works with the kindergarten to grade 12 education system to provide curriculum-related experiences that allow students to explore the combination of both artistic and scientific skills. In 2015, Beakerhead worked with 24,200 students in 104 participating schools. The current school programs include field trips, school visits, and an annual Ingenuity Challenge.

=== SciComm Lab ===
For the past ten years, the co-founders of Beakerhead, [[Jay Ingram]] and [http://www.cdnsciencepub.com/blog/women-in-science-mary-anne-moser-ceo-and-cofounder-of-beakerhead.aspx Mary Anne Moser], have hosted a science and communications program at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity where participants could learn to present science with a compelling, audience-focused approach. Previously, the SciComm labs have been intensive two-week summer courses, but, as of 2017, Beakerhead is extending the program and offering courses across Canada. Previous course sessions included "Elevator Pitch," "Personalizing the Impersonal," "Audience-Focused Communications," and "Improv."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8316">The '''Berlin Institute for Population and Development''' ({{lang-de|Berlin-Institut für Bevölkerung und Entwicklung}}) is an independent scientific research institute that aims to improve the way in which international [[Demography|demographic]] change is perceived and dealt with in the context of [[sustainable development]]. To reach this goal, the institute publishes studies and discussion papers. It also offers an online handbook on demography and publishes a [[newsletter]]. The institute is financed by contributions, project funds, earnings from the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation’s]] endowment, and contributions to the endowment. The institute is headed by Reiner Klingholz, who studied chemistry, earning a PhD in molecular biology. Earlier in his career, Reiner Klingholz worked as a journalist for the German weekly Die Zeit and the bi-annual magazine Geo Wissen.

== History ==

The Berlin Institute for Population and Development was founded in 2000 by Marlene von Reichenbach and has since been recognised as a foundation (non-profit organisation). The institute has no political or [[Religion|religious]] affiliations.

During the initial years of its existence, the institute received general support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Today it has a broad range of sponsors, which are listed on the institute’s website. Among the more prominent are the Robert Bosch Foundation, the Erste Foundation, and the Software AG Foundation.&lt;ref name=berlininst/&gt;

''The Demographic State of the Nation – How Sustainable Are Germany’s Regions?'' (2006) describes demographic change in [[Germany]] and its expected impact on Germany’s 439 German [[region]]s and [[Municipality|municipalities]]. Based on a set of 22 demographic, [[Economics|economic]], social, and [[education]]al indicators, the authors of the study come up with an assessment of the sustainability of each of the 439 units covered. Aside from identifying general trends such as an [[ageing]] and dwindling population, the study sheds light on some important patterns of internal [[human migration|migration]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany headed for population disaster? |url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/04/28/fea.htm |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban regions surrounding big cities like [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]], alongside other economically prosperous regions, turn out to be prime destinations for internal migrants.   

''Male Emergency'' (2007) analyses the causes and consequences of young women leaving the states of eastern Germany: the regions are becoming poorer – socially, economically and demographically. A portion of the men who have stayed behind now constitute a new [[underclass]]. The authors of the study Male Emergency see educational advancement as the main reason for the disproportionate outward migration of young women. They strongly recommend setting up programmes aimed at boosting the motivation and educational qualifications of young males who have fallen behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=East German women flee for western jobs |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=153695 |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Unintentionally Childless'' (2007) looks into the question of how [[reproductive medicine]] can contribute to mitigating the demographic crisis in Germany. The study concludes that aside from modern family policies and increased efforts to combat the causes of biological-medical infertility, [[medicine]] could help couples, whose wish for children has gone unfulfilled, thus contributing, to a certain extent, to raising birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unfreiwillig ohne Kinder |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/659/378465/text/ |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Talents, Technology and Tolerance'' (2007) examines, on the basis of [[Richard Florida]]’s theory of the [[creative class]], the prospects of Germany’s regions in a future knowledge-based society. The theory postulates that a successful economy requires a society in which talent, technology and tolerance can all flourish equally. Measured according to the TTT criteria, Berlin possesses the greatest creative potential among the German states, followed by Hamburg and [[Baden-Württemberg]]. By comparison, the eastern German states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Thuringia]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] lag far behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Creative Class' Could Fuel Berlin Boom |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2007/gb20071010_858418.htm?chan=search |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205165758/http://businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2007/gb20071010_858418.htm?chan=search |archivedate=5 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emancipation or child benefits?'' (2008) compares the social conditions for different fertility rates in the nations of western Europe based on an array of socioeconomic indicators. It shows clearly that the traditionally negative correlation between wealth and social development on the one hand and fertility on the other no longer holds once a society has reached a certain level of [[social development|development]]. Today more children are born in the countries with the most advanced social systems in regard to [[gender equality]]. Based on this result, we propose to discuss the problem of low-fertility countries from a different point of view. Neither child benefits nor other sources of financial aid appear to motivate people in modern industrial societies to have more children. What is far more crucial is equality of men and women in society.

''Europe’s Demographic Future'' (2008) is the institute’s first major study that has been translated fully into English. The study compares and assesses the various regions of the EU-27 countries as well as [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], as well as a number of selected eastern European countries on the basis of 24 demographic, economic, social, and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]al indicators. The study shows the very different ways in which individual countries are affected by and deal with demographic challenges. The authors of the study map out the ways in which mutual learning can help European countries in dealing with concrete challenges facing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study Shows Europe's Population Falling |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93995083 |work=[[NPR]] |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unutilised Potentials – On the Current State of Integration in Germany'' (2009) is dedicated to the 15 million persons in Germany that have a migration background. In order to assess the integration performance of eight different immigrant groups, the institute has developed an Integration Measurement Index (IMI), which is based on 20 indicators for assimilation, [[education]], working life, and [[social security]]. The results of the study show that the roughly two million persons stemming from other EU-25 countries (without southern [[Europe]]) are best integrated. On the other hand, migrants from [[Turkey]] in particular tend to show massive integration deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survey Shows Alarming Lack of Integration in Germany |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,603588,00.html |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Looked at in regional terms, integration tends generally to work out better in places where there is demand in the [[labour market]] for large numbers of highly qualified workers.&lt;ref name=berlininst&gt;[http://www.berlin-institut.org Website of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRISPR-Display ('''CRISP-Disp''')''' is a modification of the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complimentary targeting sequence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80-250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|448x448px|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90-4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|629x629px|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title="Cat's Cradling" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====

One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

The '''UCD Center for Mind and Brain''' is a [[research]] and [[training]] unit at the [[University of California, Davis]] dedicated to understanding the nature of the [[human mind]] from interdisciplinary perspectives.

Scientists currently in the CMB (19 core members), and those who will be recruited to join it, include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how our minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]), [[biological science]] ([[behavioral neuroscience|behavioral]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[physiology]]), [[engineering science]] ([[biomedical]] and [[electrical engineering]], [[computer science]]), and [[medical science]] ([[neurology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[medical imaging]]).

The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the [[brain]]? Scientists in the CMB study language, memory, attention, cognitive control, emotion, multi-sensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants, children, and adults, and in special patient populations. We are also a leader in the emerging field of translational cognitive neuroscience, which endeavors to translate basic science findings about the operation of healthy minds and brains into clinical research on mind-[[brain disorder]]s such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[attention deficit disorder]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities.

'''David Wilkinson''' (January 5, 1771 – February 3, 1852)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Resources/Wilkinson_David.cfm ASME.org bio&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[mechanical engineer]] who invented a [[lathe]] for cutting screw threads, which was  extremely important in the development of the machine tool industry in the early 19th century.

==Early life==
David Wilkinson was born at [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]] in 1771, the son of Oziel Wilkinson, a skilled [[blacksmith]] who moved his family to [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] in the 1780s.

About 1784, his father, Oziel began making anchors in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] for the emerging shipbuilding industry. The shop was powered by water from the [[Blackstone River]], and was located on the grounds of the present-day [[Slater Mill Historic Site]].

==Industrial career==
In 1790, [[Samuel Slater]] and his partners were interested in building a textile spinning mill in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] he sought the assistance of David Wilkinson and his father Oziel to produce the machinery for his new mill. They produced iron forgings and castings for Slater's carding and spinning machines.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power”.  David Wilkinson&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1793 Slater's operations were moved from a clothier's shop near the Pawtucket Falls to a new mill, which today is part of the [[Slater Mill Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5659.pdf The Wilkinson Mill brochure, Gary Kulik and Patrick M. Malone, October 12, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795 Oziel Wilkinson built a rolling and slitting mill just south of Slater's cotton mill. Both mills were powered with water from the same trench.

==Wilkinson lathe==
Textile machinery manufacturer and scientific writer [[Zachariah Allen]] had the following to say about Wilkinson's lathe in 1861:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It has to this day proved the most effective tool placed within the control of mankind for shaping refractory metals and for accomplishing the triumph of mind over matter.  The slide engine is employed in the great machine shops of America and Europe.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ross Tompson (2009) on the importance of Wilkinson's lathe:&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865
 |last=Thompson
 |first= Ross
|authorlink= 
|coauthors= 
|year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press
|location= Baltimore, MD
|isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}
|page=262
&lt;/ref&gt;

:'In his "Reminiscences", Wilkinson claimed his lathe was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"worth all the other tools in use, in any workshop in the world, for finishing [machining] brass and iron"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the versatility of his lathe Wilkinson said:&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The weighted side, the joint made by gravity, applies to planing, turning, and boring of metals of every kind, and in every way."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An 1848 report from the Committee on Military Affairs to the U.S. Senate highlighted the importance of Wilkinson's invention, for which the patent had expired in 1812:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Being left open to general use, an invention so vastly important in its character could not fail to be sought after, not only in the public at large, but also by agents of the government engaged in the fabrication of arms of various descriptions; and hence we find the gauge and sliding lathe was early introduced and made use of by all the arsenals and armories of the United States."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report went on to say 'Wilkinson was the "true and undisputed author" of the lathe, and that it was "indispensable" for making firearms, and that public armories used 200 lathes based on the invention.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;  The report recommended a $10,000 reward, which he was given.

Wilkinson failed to generate much income from his lathe. Records exist for the sale of one lathe and a few parts.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;

David Wilkinson's lathe is often compared to [[Henry Maudslay|Henry Maudslay's]] which is believed to have been invented a few years before Wilkinson's.  Maudslay's lathe used change gears which allowed it to cut threads of various pitches, without which Wilkinson's could only cut a fixed pitch.  Wilkinson's lathe could handle heavier work.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilkinson Mill==
In 1810, the present-day Wilkinson Mill was built near their existing rolling and slitting mill and Slater's cotton mill. Three and one-half stories tall and constructed from field stones, it contained a machine shop on the first floor and cotton spinning mill on the upper floors.

In 1829, during a depression in the textile industry, David Wilkinson was forced to sell his mills. He left [[Rhode Island]] settling initially in [[Cohoes, New York]]. In 1831 the mill was sold to William Field and Thomas LeFavour. The mill would later be used to produce woolen and knitted textiles. Between 1873 and 1887 Lorenzo P. Bosworth operated a machine shop in the mill. He produced machinery and tools for the leather and jewelry industries. A braiding company would occupy the second and third floors between 1884 and 1901.

The Wilkinson Mill was later sold to the Pawtucket Electric Lighting Company. It was also used as a furniture warehouse during the 20th century.

==Legacy==
The Wilkinson Mill was restored in the early 1970s as part of the [[Slater Mill Historic Site]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. The [[watermill]] site currently features a working 16,000-pound breastshot [[water wheel]] that powers, via [[gear|gear systems]] and leather [[pulley]]s, various [[drive shaft]]s to operate machinery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slatermill.org/museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) designated the Wilkinson Mill in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/Wilkinson_Mill_1810.cfm #30 Wilkinson Mill (1810)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, if degeneracy is present in a pair of components then there will exist conditions where the pair will appear [[functionally redundant]] but other conditions where they will appear functionally distinct.&lt;ref name="Edelman and Gally"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitacre"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre | title =  Degeneracy: a link between evolvability, robustness and complexity in biological systems |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2010 | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | url = http://www.tbiomed.com/content/7/1/6  | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-6 |  pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this use of the term has practically no relevance to the questionably meaningful concept of evolutionarily [[Devolution (biology)|degenerate]] populations that have lost [[Ancestor|ancestral]] functions.

== Biological examples ==
Examples of degeneracy are found in the [[genetic code]], when many different [[nucleotide sequences]] encode the same [[polypeptide]]; in [[protein folding]], when different polypeptides fold to be structurally and functionally equivalent; in [[protein]] functions, when overlapping binding functions and similar catalytic specificities are observed; in [[metabolism]], when multiple, parallel [[biosynthetic]] and [[catabolic]] pathways may coexist.
More generally, degeneracy is observed in proteins of every functional class (e.g. [[enzymatic]], structural, or regulatory),&lt;ref name="Atamas"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Atamas | title =  Les affinités électives |  journal = Pour la Science | year = 2005 | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 39–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Wagner | title =  The role of population size, pleiotropy and fitness effects of mutations in the evolution of overlapping gene functions |  journal = Genetics | year = 2000 | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 1389–1401 |  pmid = 10757778 |  pmc = 1461000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein complex]] assemblies,&lt;ref name="Kurakin"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Kurakin | title =  Scale-free flow of life: on the biology, economics, and physics of the cell |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2009 | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pmid=19416527 | doi=10.1186/1742-4682-6-6 | pmc=2683819 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ontogenesis]],&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Newman | title =  Generic physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis: A common basis for development and evolution |  journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year = 1994 | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 480 |  doi = 10.1046/j.1420-9101.1994.7040467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nervous system]],&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Tononi | title =  Measures of degeneracy and redundancy in biological networks |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 1999 | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 3257–3262 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.6.3257| last2 =  Sporns | first2 =  O. | last3 =  Edelman | first3 =  G.

== Contribution to robustness ==
Degeneracy contributes to the [[Robustness (evolution)|robustness]] of [[biological trait]]s through several mechanisms. Degenerate components compensate for one another under conditions where they are functionally redundant, thus providing robustness against component or pathway failure. Because degenerate components are somewhat different, they tend to harbor unique sensitivities so that a targeted attack such as a specific [[:wikt:inhibitor|inhibitor]] is less likely to present a risk to all components at once.&lt;ref name="Whitacre" /&gt; There are numerous biological examples where degeneracy contributes to robustness in this way. For instance, [[Gene family|gene families]] can encode for diverse proteins with many distinctive roles yet sometimes these proteins can compensate for each other during lost or suppressed [[gene expression]], as seen in the developmental roles of the [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhesins]] gene family in [[Saccharomyces]].&lt;ref name="Guo et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Guo | title =  A Saccharomyces gene family involved in invasive growth, cell-cell adhesion, and mating |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 2000 | volume = 97 | issue = 22 | pages = 12158–12163 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.220420397| last2 =  Styles | first2 =  C.

R. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nutrients can be [[Metabolism|metabolized]] by distinct [[metabolic pathway]]s that are effectively interchangeable for certain metabolites even though the total effects of each pathway are not identical.&lt;ref name="Kitano"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Kitano | title =  Biological robustness |  journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | year = 2004 | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 826–837 |  doi = 10.1038/nrg1471 |  pmid = 15520792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma and Zeng"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Ma and Zeng | title =  The connectivity structure, giant strong component and centrality of metabolic networks |  journal = Bioinformatics | year = 2003 | volume = 19 | issue = 11 | pages = 1423–1430 |  doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg177 |  pmid = 12874056 |  last2 = Zeng |  first2 = AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[cancer]], therapies targeting the [[EGF receptor]] are thwarted by the [[Coactivation (Transcription)|co-activation]] of alternate [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s (RTK) that have partial functional overlap with the EGF receptor (and are therefore degenerate), but are not targeted by the same specific EGF receptor inhibitor.&lt;ref name="Huang et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Huang | title =  Quantitative analysis of EGFRvIII cellular signaling networks reveals a combinatorial therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year = 2007 | volume = 104 | issue = 31 | pages = 12867 | id = |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.0705158104 |  last2 = Mukasa |  first2 = A. |  last3 = Bonavia |  first3 = R. |  last4 = Flynn |  first4 = R.

== Theory ==
[[File:Relationships between degeneracy, complexity, robustness, and evolvability.png|thumb|right|300px|Theoretical relationships between biological properties that are important to evolution. For a review of evidence that supports these relationships, see.&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;]]

Several theoretical developments have outlined links between degeneracy and important biological measurements related to robustness, complexity, and [[evolvability]]. These include:
* Theoretical arguments supported by simulations have proposed that degeneracy can lead to distributed forms of robustness in protein interaction networks.&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Networked buffering: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2010 | volume = 7 | issue = 20 | pages = 20| id = | url = http://www.tbiomed.com/content/7/1/20 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-20 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = Axel | pmid=20550663 | pmc=2901314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those authors suggest that similar phenomena is likely to arise in other biological networks and potentially may contribute to the resilience of [[ecosystem]]s as well.
* Tononi ''et al.'' have found evidence that degeneracy is inseparable from the existence of hierarchical complexity in [[neural population]]s.&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."/&gt; They argue that the link between degeneracy and complexity is likely to be much more general.
* Fairly abstract simulations have supported the hypothesis that degeneracy fundamentally alters the propensity for a genetic system to access novel heritable [[phenotype]]s&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender_b"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Degeneracy: a design principle for achieving robustness and evolvability |  journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | year = 2010 | volume = 263 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–153 | id = | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19925810 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.11.008 |  pmid = 19925810 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that degeneracy could therefore be a precondition for open-ended [[evolution]].
* The three hypotheses above have been integrated in&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt; where they propose that degeneracy plays a central role in the open-ended evolution of biological complexity. In the same article, it was argued that the absence of degeneracy within many designed (abiotic) complex systems may help to explain why robustness appears to be in conflict with flexibility and adaptability, as seen in software, [[systems engineering]], and [[artificial life]].&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;

[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be

* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

In [[reliability engineering]], '''dual modular redundancy''' ('''DMR''') is when components of a system are duplicated, providing [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in case one should fail. It is particularly applied to systems where the duplicated components work in parallel, particularly in [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s. A typical example is a complex computer system which has duplicated nodes, so that should one node fail, another is ready to carry on its work.

DMR provides robustness to the failure of one component, and [[error detection]] in case instruments or computers that should give the same result give different results, but does not provide [[error correction]], as ''which'' component is correct and which is malfunctioning cannot be automatically determined. There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | title = [[The Mythical Man-Month]] | last = Brooks | first = Frederick J. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | year = 1995 | origyear = 1975 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 64  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning, if two [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods.  Examples include [[1ESS switch]].

A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

==Examples==
The Submarine Command System [[SMCS]] used on submarines of the [[Royal Navy]] employs duplicated central computing nodes, interconnected by a duplicated LAN.

The '''medical effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima''' upon humans can be put into the four categories below, with the effects of larger [[thermonuclear weapon]]s producing blast and thermal effects so large that there would be a negligible number of survivors close enough to the center of the blast who would experience prompt/acute radiation effects, which were observed after the 16 [[kiloton]] yield Hiroshima bomb, due to its relatively low yield:&lt;ref name="remm.nlm.gov"&gt;http://www.remm.nlm.gov/RemmMockup_files/radiationlethality.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf page 3. see ''negligible''. Meaning that if you are close enough to get a harmful dose of radiation from a 1 megaton weapons, you are going to die from blast effects alone.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Initial stage—the first 1–9 weeks, in which are the greatest number of deaths, with 90% due to [[thermal]] injury and/or blast effects and 10% due to super-lethal [[radiation]] exposure.
*Intermediate stage—from 10–12 weeks. The deaths in this period are from [[ionizing radiation]] in the median lethal range - [[LD50]]
*Late period—lasting from 13–20 weeks. This period has some improvement in survivors' condition.
*Delayed period—from 20+ weeks. Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand [[Millisievert]]s of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders. Furthermore, ionizing radiation above a dose of around 50-100 [[Millisievert]] exposure has been shown to statistically begin increasing a person's chance of dying of cancer sometime in their lifetime over the normal unexposed rate of c. 25%, in the long term, a heightened rate of cancer, proportional to the dose received, would begin to be observed after c. 5+ years, with lesser problems such as eye [[cataract]]s and other more minor effects in other organs and tissue also being observed over the long term.

Depending on whether individuals further afield [[shelter in place]] or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind, and therefore avoid contact with the [[fallout]] plume, and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion, their exposure to fallout, and therefore their total dose, will vary. With those who do shelter in place, and or evacuate, experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal.&lt;ref&gt;7 hour rule: At 7 hours after detonation the fission product activity will have decreased to about 1/10 (10%) of its amount at 1 hour.
At about 2 days (49 hours-7X7) the activity will have decreased to 1% of the 1-hour value! http://www.falloutradiation.com/johnwayne7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf Nuclear Warfare chapter 9 see page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout [[isotope]], [[I-131]] decays away to 0.1% of its initial quantity after ten [[half-life|half-lives]] – which is represented by 80 days in the care of [[I-131]] case, would make the difference between likely contracting [[thyroid cancer]] or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scientists estimate that if there were a [[nuclear war]] resulting in 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities, it could cause significant loss of life in the tens of millions from long term climatic effects alone. The climatology hypothesis is that ''if'' each city [[firestorm]]s, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a [[nuclear winter]] scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, ''Scientific American'', June 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blast effects — the initial stage ==

===Immediate post-attack period===
[[Image:Nukemetal.jpg|thumb|Melted and fused pieces of metal (including coins that were in people's pockets) from the Atomic bombings of Japan. The melting of metal like this occurred during the ensuing fires and [[firestorms]], long after the bombs had exploded.]]

The main causes of death and disablement in this state are thermal burns and the failure of structures resulting from the blast effect. Injury from the pressure wave is minimal in contrast because the human body can survive up to 2 bar (30 psi) while most buildings can only withstand a 0.8 bar (12 psi) blast. Therefore, the fate of humans is closely related to the survival of the buildings around them.&lt;ref name = "Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Hugh. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 50-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate within certain peak overpressure===
* over 0.8 bar (12 psi) - 98% dead, 2% injured
* 0.3 - 0.8 bar (5-12 psi) - 50% dead, 40% injured, 10% safe
* 0.14 - 0.3 bar (2-5 psi) - 5% dead, 45% injured, 50% safe&lt;ref name = "Middleton"/&gt;

==Types of radioactive exposure after a nuclear attack==
 [[Image:The patient's skin is burned in a pattern corresponding to the dark portions of a kimono - NARA - 519686.jpg|thumb|Japanese woman (one of the [[Hiroshima Maidens]]) suffering burns from thermal radiation after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan.]]

In a nuclear explosion the human body can be irradiated by at least three processes. The first, and most major, cause of burns is due to [[thermal]] radiation and not caused by [[ionizing]] radiation.

* Thermal [[burn]]s from [[infrared]] heat radiation, these would be the most common burn type experienced by personnel.
* If people come in direct contact with [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]], [[beta burn]]s from shallow ionizing [[beta particle|beta radiation]] will be experienced, the largest particles (visible to the naked eye) in [[Nuclear fallout#Local|local fallout]] would be likely to have very high radioactivity because they would be deposited so soon after detonation; this fraction of the total fallout is called the prompt or local fallout fraction. It is likely that one such particle upon the skin would be able to cause a localized beta burn. This local fallout, termed ''Bikini snow'' after the Pacific island weapon tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23287814?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102598558117|title=Conservation and Heritage in the Face of Insular Urbanization: The Marshall Islands and Kiribati|first=Stephen A.|last=Royle|year=1999|work=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=25|number= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was experienced by the crew on the deck of the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]'' fishing ship following the explosion of the 15 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Shrimp'' device in the [[Castle Bravo]] event. However, these particular decay particles ([[beta particle]]s) are very weakly penetrating and have a short range, requiring almost direct contact between fallout and personnel to be harmful.
* Rarer still would be personnel who experience [[radiation burn]]s from highly penetrating [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. This would likely cause deep gamma penetration within the body, which would result in uniform whole body irradiation rather than only a surface burn. In cases of whole body gamma irradiation (c. 10 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]) due to accidents involving medical product irradiators, some of the human subjects have developed injuries to their skin between the time of irradiation and death.

In the picture above, the normal clothing (a [[kimono]]) that the woman was wearing attenuated the far reaching [[thermal radiation]]; the kimono, however, would  naturally have been unable to attenuate any [[gamma radiation]], if she were close enough to the weapon to have experienced any, and it would be likely that any such penetrating radiation effect would be evenly applied to her entire body. [[Beta burn]]s would likely be all over the body if there was contact with fallout after the explosion, unlike thermal burns, which are only ever on one side of the body, as heat radiation [[infrared]] naturally does not penetrate the human body. In addition, the pattern on her clothing has been burnt into the skin by the thermal radiation. This is because white fabric reflects more visible and [[infrared]] light than dark fabric. As a result, the skin underneath dark fabric is burned more than the skin covered by white clothing.

There is also the risk of internal radiation poisoning by ingestion of fallout particles, if one is in a fallout zone.

==Radiation poisoning==
{{main|acute radiation syndrome}}
'''Radiation poisoning''', also called "'''radiation sickness'''" or a "'''creeping dose'''", is a form of damage to organ tissue due to excessive exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of [[radiation]] in a short period, though this also has occurred with long-term exposure to low-level radiation. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning occur as ionizing radiation interferes with cell division. There are numerous lethal radiation syndromes, including [[prodromal]] syndrome, [[bone marrow]] death, [[central nervous system]] death and [[gastrointestinal]] death.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"&gt;Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prodromal syndrome ===
The “prodromal syndrome” is not a diagnosis, but the technical term used by mental health professionals to describe a specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset of an illness. For example, a fever is “prodromal” to measles, which means that a fever may be a risk factor for developing this illness.

=== Bone marrow death ===
[[Bone marrow]] death is caused by a dose of radiation between 2 and 10 Gray and is characterized by the part of the bone marrow that makes the blood being broken down. Therefore, production of [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cells]] and platelets is stopped due to loss of the blood-making [[stem cells]] (4.5 Gray kills 95% of stem cells). The loss of [[platelet]]s greatly increases the chance of fatal [[hemorrhage]], while the lack of white blood cells causes infections; the fall in red blood cells is minimal, and only causes mild [[anemia]].&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The exposure to 4.5 Gray of penetrating gamma rays has many effects that occur at different times:

In 24 hours:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*[[vomiting]]
*[[diarrhea]]
These will usually abate after 6–7 days.

Within 3–4 weeks there is a period of extreme illness.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*severe bloody diarrhea, indicating intestinal disorders causing fluid imbalance
*extensive [[internal bleeding]]
*[[septicemia]] infections

The peak incidence of acute BM death corresponds to the 30-day nadir in blood cell numbers. The number of deaths then falls progressively until it reaches 0 at 60 days after irradiation. The amount of radiation greatly affects the probability of death. For example, over the range of 2 to 6 Gray the probability of death in untreated adults goes from about 1% to 99%, but these figures are for healthy adults. Therefore, results may differ, because of the thermal and mechanical injuries and infectious conditions.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal death ===
Gastrointestinal death is caused by a dose of radiation between 10 and 50 Gray. Whole body doses cause damage to [[epithelial cells]] lining the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe, causing exhaustion and [[emaciation]] in a few days and death within 7–14 days from loss of water and electrolytes.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The symptoms of gastrointestinal death are:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*gastrointestinal pain
*anorexia
*nausea
*vomiting
*diarrhea

=== Central nervous system death ===
[[Central nervous system]] death is the main cause of death in 24–48 hours among those exposed to 50 Gray.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The symptoms are:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*vomiting
*nausea
*diarrhea
*[[drowsiness]]
*[[lethargy]]
*tremors
*[[delirium]]
*frequent [[seizure]]s
*[[convulsions]]
*[[hyperthermia|heat prostration]]
*[[coma]]
*[[respiratory failure]]
*[[death]]

== Short-term effects (6–8 weeks) ==

=== Skin ===
The [[Human skin|skin]] is susceptible to beta-emitting radioactive fallout. The principal site of damage is the [[germinal layer]], and often the initial response is [[erythema]] (reddening) due to [[blood vessel]]s congestion and [[edema]]. Erythema lasting more than 10 days occurs in 50% of people exposed to 5-6 Gray.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

Other effects with exposure include:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2–3 Gray—temporary [[hair loss]]
*7 Gray—permanent [[epilation]] occurs
*10 Gray—itching and flaking occurs
*10–20 Gray—weeping [[blister]]ing and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation will occur

=== Lungs ===
The [[lung]]s are the most radiosensitive organ, and [[radiation pneumonitis]] can occur leading to [[pulmonary insufficiency]] and death (100% after exposure to 50 Gray of radiation), in a few months.

Radiation [[pneumonitis]] is characterized by:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*Loss of epithelial cells
*[[Edema]]
*[[Inflammation]]
*Occlusions of airways, air sacs and blood vessels
*[[Fibrosis]]

=== Ovaries ===
A single dose of 1–2 Gray will cause temporary damage and suppress [[menstruation]] for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

=== Testicles===
A dose of 0.1 Gray will cause low sperm counts for up to a year; 2.5 Gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

==Long-term effects==

===Cataract induction===
The timespan for developing this symptom ranges from 6 months to 30 years to develop but the median time for developing them is 2–3 years.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2 Gray of gamma rays cause opacities in a few percent
*6-7 Gray can seriously impair vision and cause [[cataracts]]

===Cancer induction===
[[Cancer]] induction is the most significant long-term risk of exposure to a nuclear bomb. Approximately 1 out of every 80 people exposed to 1 Gray will die from cancer, in addition to the normal rate of 20 out of 80. About 1 in 40 people will get cancer, in addition to the typical rates of 16-20 out of 40. Different types of cancer take different times for them to appear:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2 years for [[leukemia]] to appear
*20 or more years for [[skin cancer]] or [[lung cancer]]

===''In utero'' effects on human development===
A 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] dose of radiation will cause between 0 and 20 extra cases of [[perinatal mortality]], per 1,000 births and 0-20 cases per 1000 births of severe mental sub-normality. A 0.05&amp;nbsp;Gy dose will increase death due to cancer 10 fold, from the normal 0.5 per 1000 birth rate to a rate of 5 per 1,000.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} An antenatal dose of 1&amp;nbsp;Gy in the first trimester causes the lifetime risk of fatal cancer sometime in the child's life to increase from c. 25% in non-exposed humans to 100% in the first trimester after exposure.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

===Transgenerational genetic damage===
Exposure to even relatively low doses of radiation generates genetic damage in the progeny of irradiated rodents.

===Infectious diseases resulting from nuclear attack===
It was assumed in the 1983 book ''Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War'' that, although not caused by radiation, one of the long-term effects of a nuclear war would be a massive increase in [[infectious disease]]s caused by [[fecal matter]] contaminated water from untreated [[sewage]], crowded living conditions, poor standard of living, and lack of [[vaccine]]s in the aftermath of a [[nuclear war]], with the following list of diseases being cited:&lt;ref name = "Middleton"/&gt;
*[[Dysentery]]
*[[Typhoid]]
*[[Infectious hepatitis]]
*[[Salmonellosis]]
*[[Cholera]]
*[[Meningococcal meningitis]]
*[[Tuberculosis]]
*[[Diphtheria]]
*[[Whooping cough]]
*[[Polio]]
*[[Pneumonia]]

However although what the authors describe are conditions already prevalent in many of the world's city [[slum]]s, it is inconceivable why people would try to remain living in crowded conditions by reverting to [[slum]] lifestyles, during or after a nuclear war. As many cities would already be destroyed, with [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slum]] or otherwise, this would serve no benefit to inhabitants.

There would be billions of disease carrying [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], in the form of city residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact122.html |title=Cities and Emerging or Re-emergging Diseases |publisher=Apps.who.int |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}{{Dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; lying deceased in cities caused by the direct nuclear weapons effects alone, with the surviving few billion people spread out in rural communities living agrarian lifestyles, with the survivors therefore posing a way of living far less prone to creating the crowded [[slum]] living conditions required for infectious diseases to spread. Moreover, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is also one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2496928 | pmid=18828410 | volume=123 | title=Disaster mythology and fact: Hurricane Katrina and social attachment | author=Jacob B, Mawson AR, Payton M, Guignard JC | journal=Public Health Rep | pages=555–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publichealthreports.org/issueopen.cfm?articleID=2091&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|[[Epidemic]]s seldom occur after a disaster, and dead bodies do not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of [[infectious disease]]s. Intuitively, epidemic diseases, illnesses, and injuries might be expected following major disasters. However, as noted by de Goyet, epidemics seldom occur after disasters, and unless deaths are caused by one of a small number of infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhus, or plague, exposure to dead bodies does not cause disease ... [[Cholera]] and [[typhoid]] seldom pose a major health threat after disasters unless they are already endemic.}}

'''Epigraphy''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιγραφή}}, "inscription") is the study of inscriptions or epigraphs as [[writing]]; it is the science of identifying [[grapheme]]s, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a [[document]] and the artistic value of a [[literature|literary]] composition.

A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an ''epigrapher'' or ''epigraphist''. For example, the [[Behistun inscription]] is an official [[document]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] engraved on native rock at a location in [[Iran]]. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of [[historian]]s, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person.

An epigraph is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] prescription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as [[numismatics]] or [[palaeography]]. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: [[engraving]]s in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] on cast metal, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] on precious stones, painting on [[ceramic]] or in [[fresco]]. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a [[clay tablet]] in a conflagration.

The study of ancient [[handwriting]], usually in ink, is a separate field, [[palaeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.umass.edu/eng3/fcd/documents/Brown_WhatIsPalaeography.pdf |title=What is Palaeography? |first=Julian |last=Brown |access-date=21 September 2018 |publisher=[[UMassAmherst]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture.  Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in [[Mycenaean Greece]] the deciphered texts of "[[Linear B]]" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are "[[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]]" in its original sense.

==History==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|The high medieval [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]], composed in [[Latin]] and stamped in [[Roman square capitals]]]]

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as [[Georg Fabricius]] (1516–1571); [[Stefano Antonio Morcelli]] (1737–1822); [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]] (1815–1877); [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903); [[Emil Hübner]] (1834–1901); [[Franz Cumont]] (1868–1947); [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] (1904–1985).

The ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New [[Book|fascicles]] are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The ''Corpus'' is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' ''[[Zoological Record]]''— the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different [[text corpus|corpora]]. There are two. The first is ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of [[classics]].

Other such series include the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]]'' (Etruscan inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae'' (Crusaders' inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' (Celtic inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum'' (Iranian inscriptions), "Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia" and "Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, [[Jean-François Champollion]], and the British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].

The interpretation of [[Maya hieroglyphs]] was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael D.

====Materials====
Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, [[terracotta]], or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in [[Egypt]]). In Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In [[Greece]] the favourite material, especially in [[Athens]], was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline [[limestone]]s, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;The following sections are based on specialist work consulted from the following sources: {{aut|[[Ernest Arthur Gardner]]}}'s article on "Epigraphy and Inscriptions", in Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was [[bronze]]: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. (cf. [[numismatics]].) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in [[Crete]]. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (''[[ostraka]]'') were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, [[amphora]] handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The ''tools'' used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of [[chisel]], usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a [[punch (tool)|punch]] or pointed [[hammer]]. Sometimes a circular punch was used for '''''O''''' or a letter of which ''O'' formed a part.

====Styles of cutting====
Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the [[hieroglyphs]] are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge-shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called ''[[cuneiform]]'' system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce ''[[Apex (diacritic)|apices]]'' or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in [[Latin Inscriptions|Roman inscriptions]], which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. [[dating methodologies in archaeology]].)

Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at [[Delos]], under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of [[Thucydides]]; and many other inscriptions approach this in length.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Symbols and forms of writing===
{{SpecialChars}}
{{see also|History of writing}}
Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also [[pictography]], which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world — in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Crete]], among the [[Hittites]] and in [[China]] and [[Americas|America]]. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from [[Ideographs]] (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to [[syllabaries]] or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the [[Phoenicians]], from whom the [[Greeks]] borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the [[Latin language|Latin]], and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] was derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].

[[File:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]
The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or [[Stone mason|masons]]' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge-shaped is most conspicuous in [[cuneiform]], but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze.

In the north of [[Europe]] the [[Ogham]] [[Ogham inscription|inscriptions]] are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the [[Morse code]]; but [[Runes]], which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] or the [[Latin alphabet]]s.

In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a [[decimal|decimal system]], doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or ''rhombi''), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at [[Epidaurus]] in the 4th century BC. In [[Athens]] the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, '''M''' for Μύριοι (10,000), '''X''' for χίλιοι (1,000), '''H''' for εκατόν (100), '''Δ''' for δέκα (10), '''π''' for πεντε (5) and '''I''' for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The [[Roman numeral|Roman]] system of numerals — M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of [[ideograph]]s representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

[[File:Crete - law of Gortyn - boustrophedon.JPG|thumb&lt;!--autosize to fit handheld devices--&gt;|left|Ancient Greek [[boustrophedon]] inscription, [[Gortyn code]], Crete, 5th century BC]]

Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under [[list of classical abbreviations]]. [[Compendia]] or [[monogram]]s also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Byzantine]] inscriptions.

Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists.This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross ([[File:Greek cross.svg|15px]]) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end.

The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern — in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (''[[boustrophedon]]'', or as an [[ox]] in [[ploughing]]). Most [[Semitic alphabets]], including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired.

In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (''[[stelae]]''), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed [[tombstone]]s were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Chief periods and nationalities===
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb]]
The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded.

Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of [[hieratic]] modification were used at different times. On the famous [[Rosetta Stone]], in the [[British Museum]], which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Assyria]]n and [[Old Persian|Persian]], until it was superseded, after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the [[Middle Minoan|Middle]] and [[Late Minoan]] periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of [[Knossos]], about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the [[Cypriot syllabary]], which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this  was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC.

In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]) the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian alphabet]], which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by [[Athens]], and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local [[Italian alphabet]]s, including the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], were derived with various modifications. The [[Roman alphabet]] was among these, being based on the [[Archaic Greek alphabets|alphabet]] of [[Caere]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day.

The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through [[medieval]] times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek Corpus]]'' records the building of a bridge in [[Sicily]] in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Methods of dating===
{{main article|Dating methodologies in archaeology}}
It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the [[Ionic alphabet]] was adopted in place of the early [[Attic Greek|Attic alphabet]] in the archonship of [[Eucleides]], 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by [[Archinus]].{{r|fragment}} But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the [[Eponymous]] [[Archon]], and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by [[Olympiads]], which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an [[emperor]]. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his [[consulate]], or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by "Indiction"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the [[Eastern Empire]] the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used.

===Purpose of inscriptions===
Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object — for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god — and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a [[potsherd]]. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by [[advertisements]] or [[posters]], thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — [[codes of law]] and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the [[Acropolis]] or the [[Agora]], could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy, Robert |author2=Sharon, Ring |author3=Salkin, Boda |year=1996 |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 66 |isbn=978-1-884964-02-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative inscriptions===
[[File:Periander Pio-Clementino Inv276.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of [[Periander]] bearing the inscription "Periander, son of [[Cypselus]], [[Corinth]]ian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original by [[Kresilas]], 4th century]]
Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to [[picture]] or [[relief]] chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of [[Cypselus]], of about 600 BC [[hexameter]] verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and [[Samos]] has a relief at its head representing the [[goddess]] [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by [[Cicero]], of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of "recycling": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of [[Germanicus]], probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Cicero]] reference cf. {{cite book |author=Margherita Guarducci   |authorlink=Margherita Guarducci |year=1995 |title=Epigrafia greca |location=Rome |publisher=Ist. Poligrafico dello Stato |pages= 87ff |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent inscriptions===
The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as ''(a) Religious'' and ''(b) Political and Social''. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention.

====Temples, their foundation and administration====
A [[temple]] was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and [[bullion]], mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or [[peculation]]. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest — there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous [[Serpent Column]], once at [[Delphi]] and now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], with the list of the Greek States which took part in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] at [[Dodona]] after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Priests and other officials====
[[File:KaranisSouthTempleGreekInscr.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription at the south temple, [[Karanis|Kom Aushim (Karanis)]], [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]]]
Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a [[priesthood]] was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly — for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple.

Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were ''[[manteis]]'' or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in [[divination]]; at [[Eleusis]] we find records of the [[hierophant]], the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.

There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Ritual====
[[File:Votive relief Asklepios BM809.jpg|thumb|Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of [[Asclepius]] at [[Milos]], [[Ægean Sea]].]]

The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from [[Thasos]] in the [[Louvre]]:— "To the [[Nymphs]] and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No [[paean]] is sung. To the [[Graces]] it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20Ma%20696&amp;object=Sculpture Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture)], ''Relief Plaques from Thasos''; see also classification on [http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink3/4DACTION/LSAGwebDisplayInscription?searchTerm=Relief&amp;searchType=browse&amp;searchField=object&amp;returnList=0&amp;sequence=0&amp;thisListPosition=8 Poinikastas:"Thasos, inscriptions"] - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of [[Alectrona]] at [[Ialysus]], it was prescribed that "no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt; Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at [[Andania]], in [[Messenia]], the arrangements for the celebration of the local [[Eleusinia]], the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.&lt;ref name="GEpi"&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUASHSU5ET&amp;sig=7bVtQ6GblyM1sojunQokSFuWsp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy''], Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUFC3S-7r4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWja_v4xvP&amp;sig=d2eJ6F9VifPiDz35NlU7PXqzFbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''Ancient Athens''], Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other [[oracle]] in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances.

Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of [[Asclepius]] at [[Epidaurus]]. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the ''[[Epidaurus|abaton]]'', has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Private associations for religious purposes====
Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which "there can be neither [[Jew]] nor [[Greek people|Greek]], there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:28|Galatians 3:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early [[codes of law]] preserved on stone, notably at [[Gortyna]] in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when [[Locrians]] established a colony in [[Naupactus]]; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his classic work (downloadable) [https://archive.org/details/griechischeepigr00larf ''Griechische Epigraphik'' (1914)] at [[University of Toronto]] - Robarts Library, eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the [[prytany]] (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate ([[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]]) or the assembly of the people ([[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the [[Hellenistic Age]], and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from [[Roman emperors]], inscribed and set up in public places.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the [[arsenal]] of [[Philon]] at the [[Peiraeus]] which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;Built under the administration of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], {{cite book|author=Smith, Sir William, ed.|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|chapter=Philon, A very eminent architect at Athens|year=1859|volume=vol. III|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|page= 314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}. E. A. Gardner, ''op.cit.'' p. 557, observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." It was to hold the rigging of the [[galley]]s; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian [[democracy]]. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the [[First Mithridatic War#Sulla's siege of Athens, summer 87-early 86 BC|Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Erechtheum]], we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the [[Parthenon]], spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Jenkins   |title=Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLego4eAgZUC|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02388-8|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey M. Hurwit   |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-42834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the [[galley]]-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A set of records of high historical value are the ''"tribute lists"'', recording the quota paid to Athens by her [[Members of the Delian League|subject allies]] during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. [[Delian League]]).

[[File:Stele with an ephebic list NAMA 1484 (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|[[Stele]] with an [[ephebos|ephebic]] list, Athens, 4th century BC]]

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the [[ephebos|ephebic system]] at Athens. There are not only records of lists of [[ephebos|ephebi]] and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=O. W. Reinmuth   |title=The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. |url= |accessdate= |year=1971 |publisher=Leiden Brill |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.&lt;ref name="GEpi"/&gt;

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and [[Epidaurus]], 151 citizens of [[Megara]] were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of ''[[proxenia]]''. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed ''proxenos'' of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s, with the essential difference that the ''proxenos'' is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a ''proxenos'', and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the ''proxenos'', and record honours consequently conferred upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Enrica Culasso Gastaldi   |title=Le prossenie ateniesi del IV secolo a.C.: gli onorati asiatici (Fonti e studi di storia antica, 10) |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |location=Alessandria |publisher=Edizioni dell'Orso |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the [[Prytaneum]] at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of [[Pericles]] on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor [[Kresilas]]. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
[[File:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|Black-figure [[dinos]] with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by [[Sophilos]]: ΣΟΦΙΛΟΣ [...] ΜΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, "Sophilos drew me"]]

These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the ''[[Victory]]'', signed on its pedestal by [[Paeonius]] at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, [[#FN1|the statue of Hercules/Heracles]] below)

A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by [[Attic vase|Attic]] and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute [[Pottery of ancient Greece|historical and stylistic study]] of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', {{cite book|author=Joseph Veach Noble   |title=The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |location=New York |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500050477 |pages=}}; {{cite book|author=Martin Robinson   |title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens |url= |accessdate= |year=1992 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521338813 |pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|autobiographical account of the deeds and administration]] of [[Augustus]], which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], because the most complete copy of it was found at [[Ancyra]]. The [[Marmor Parium]] at [[Oxford]], found in [[Paros]], is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author1=P. Botteri |author2=G. Fangi |title=The Ancyra Project: the Temple of Augustus and Rome |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |location=Ankara |publisher=ISPRS Archives, volume XXXIV part 5/W12 Commission V |isbn= |pages=84–88}}; see also ''[https://archive.org/details/parianchronicle00robegoog The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity]'' by [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] 1788, from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his [[deme]]. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as "a good and wise man". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such [[epitaph]]s were frequently in [[metrical form]], usually either [[hexameter]] or [[elegiacs]]. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'' the interesting ''[[Epitaph of Seikilos]]'' by C. V. Palisca &amp; J. P. Burkholder, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin inscriptions==
{{See also|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|List of classical abbreviations}}
[[File:Aquileia Basilica - Ausgrabungen Mosaik 5.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Aquileia]], 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: ''IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX'' (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic)]]

[[Latin language|Latin]] inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the [[provinces of the Roman Empire]]. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering [[Latin Inscriptions]] lies in the very extensive use of [[List of classical abbreviations|initials and abbreviations]]. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.&lt;ref&gt;A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in [[René Cagnat]]'s ''Cours d'épigraphie Latine'' (repr. 1923). A selection is included in [[Wikipedia]]'s "[[List of classical abbreviations]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as '''V.S.L.M.''' (''votum solvit libens merito''), or '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'') offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of ''[[tesserae]]'' or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

===Religious===

====Dedications and foundations of temples, etc.====
[[File:RMW - Weiheplakette Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Votive plaque for ''Victoria'', set by Flavius Primus, curator of the [[Turma]] [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximini]]&lt;ref&gt;It reads: ''Victo(riae) Fl(avius) P/rimus cur(ator) / tur(mae) Maxi/mini''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is '''D.D.''' (''dedit, donavit'') often with additions such as '''L.M.''' (''libens merito''). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and '''V.S.''' (''votum solvit'') is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of [[Equestrian order|equestrian status]]; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the [[Arval Brothers]]. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various collegese for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the [[Augurs]], the [[Fetiales]], the [[Salii]]; also the [[Sodales Augustales|Sodales Divorum Augustorum]] in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. [[Haruspices]] and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|Luperci]] were of equestrian rank.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word ''lex'' (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian orgies]] in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula '''QDERFP''' (''quid de ea re fieri placeret''); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with '''DERIC''' (''de ea re ita censuerunt''). '''C.''' is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of [[Diocletian]], [[Edict on Maximum Prices|fixing the prices of all commodities]]. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=E.R. Graser   |title=An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome Volume V: Rome and Italy of the Empire |editor=T. Frank |url= |accessdate= |year=1940 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press — esp. "A text and translation of the Edict of Diocletian" |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Records of buildings, etc.====
[[File:Hans lutz Pfk bozen.jpg|thumb|German inscription recording the building of [[Bozen]]-Bolzano's Parish Church ([[South Tyrol]]) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501–1519)]]
A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, roads, especially on [[milestone]]s, baths, [[basilica]]s, [[portico]]s and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., '''S.P.''', ''sua pecunia'') and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
[[File:AMG - Ziegel Cohors III.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brick stamp with military record: "C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)", from [[Bavaria]].]]

These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. "They are numerous and of all sorts — tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important."&lt;ref name="Haverf"&gt;{{aut|Francis Haverfield}}, "Roman Authority" in {{aut|S. R. Driver, D. G. Hogarth, F. L. Griffith}}, ''et al.'' ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature'', Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, "you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers."&lt;ref name="Haverf"/&gt;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in [[Roman Republic|republican times]]; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.
&lt;span id="FN1"&gt;

====Proxeny====
{{See also|Patronage in ancient Rome}}
This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'', by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (''[[cursus honorum]]''), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of [[Hercules]] by [[Lysippus]], of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was [[#FN1|made by Glycon (see images)]]. Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

[[File:MCR - colonna rostrata di C Duilio 1150130.JPG|thumb|Reproduction of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' of [[Gaius Duilius]] (c. 260 BC) at the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]].]]

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' in Rome, which records the great naval victory of [[Gaius Duilius]] over the [[Carthaginians]]; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]. The various sets of [[Fasti]] constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====
[[Image:Scipio-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tomb]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], erected around 150 BC, contains an [[Old Latin]] inscription in [[Saturnian Metre]].]]
These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipios]] at Rome, recording, mostly in [[Saturnian Metre]], the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.&lt;ref name="Cour"&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Edward Courtney   |title=MUSA LAPIDARIA: A Selection of Latin Verse Inscriptions |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters '''D.M.''' or '''D.M.S.''' (''Dis Manibus sacrum''), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the [[Manes|body of ghosts or spirits of the dead]]. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with '''H.I.''' (''Hic iacet''), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use — for instance, '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'', this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, '''V.S.F.''' (''vivus sibi fecit''). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.&lt;ref name="Cour"/&gt;

====Milestones and boundaries====
Milestones (''[[Miliarium#Milestones and markers|miliaria]]'') have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (''[[Boundary marker|termini]]'') are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called '''III. viri A.I.A.''' (''agris iudicandis adsignandis'') in the time of the [[Gracchi]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of [[Roman history]] and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is [[Roman history]] in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship — all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, [[Etruscology]], Italic and Latin [[philology]], ancient pottery, comparative [[palaeography]], Roman nomenclature, [[Latin verse]], [[lexicography]] (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography0, Roman architecture and [[prosopography]], and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arthur E. Gordon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Latin Epigraphy''], [[University of California Press]], 1983, Introd., pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">'''Exploratory search''' is a specialization of information exploration which represents the activities carried out by searchers who are:&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White and Resa A. Roth (2009). ''Exploratory Search: Beyond the Query-Response Paradigm'', San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool.&lt;/ref&gt;
* unfamiliar with the domain of their goal (i.e. need to learn about the topic in order to understand how to achieve their goal)
* or unsure about the ways to achieve their goals (either the technology or the process)
* or unsure about their goals in the first place.

Consequently, exploratory search covers a broader class of activities than typical [[information retrieval]], such as investigating, evaluating, comparing, and synthesizing, where new information is sought in a defined conceptual area; exploratory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[exploratory data analysis|data analysis]] is another example of an information exploration activity. Typically, therefore, such users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation.

==History==
Exploratory search is a topic that has grown from the fields of [[information retrieval]] and [[information seeking]] but has become more concerned with alternatives to the kind of search that has received the majority of focus (returning the most relevant documents to a [[Google]]-like keyword search). The research is motivated by questions like "what if the user doesn't know which keywords to use?" or "what if the user isn't looking for a single answer?". Consequently, research has begun to focus on defining the broader set of ''information behaviors'' in order to learn about the situations when a user is, or feels, limited by only having the ability to perform a keyword search.

In the last few years,{{When|date=April 2016}} a series of workshops has been held at various related and key events. In 2005, the Exploratory Search Interfaces workshop focused on beginning to define some of the key challenges in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/xsi/index.html|title=HCIL SOH 2005 Workshop on Exploratory Search Interfaces|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then a series of other workshops has been held at related conferences: Evaluating Exploratory Search&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/eess/index.html|title=SIGIR 2006 Workshop - Evaluating Exploratory Search Systems|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at SIGIR06&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigir2006.org|title=Sigir 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Exploratory Search and HCI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/esi/index.html|title=CHI 2007 Workshop - Exploratory Search and HCI|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at CHI07&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chi2007.org|title=CHI 2007 Reach Beyond - welcome|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in order to meet with the experts in [[human–computer interaction]]).

In March 2008, an ''Information Processing and Management'' special issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03064573|title=Information Processing &amp; Management|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White, Gary Marchionini, Gheorghe Muresan (2008). ''Evaluating exploratory search systems: Introduction to special topic issue of information processing and management'' Vol. 44, Issue 2, (2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;433–436&lt;/ref&gt; focused particularly on the challenges of evaluating exploratory search, given the reduced assumptions that can be made about scenarios of use.

In June 2008, the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an invitational workshop to identify a research agenda for exploratory search and similar fields for the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ils.unc.edu/ISSS_workshop/|title=Moved|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research challenges==

===Important scenarios===
With the majority of research in the [[information retrieval]] community focusing on typical keyword search scenarios, one challenge for exploratory search is to further understand the scenarios of use for when keyword search is not sufficient. An example scenario, often used to motivate the research by mSpace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mspace.fm mSpace]&lt;/ref&gt; states: if a user does not know much about classical music, how should they even begin to find a piece that they might like. Similarly, for patients or their carers, if they don't know the right keywords for their health problems, how can they effectively find useful health information for themselves?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pang|first1=PCI|last2=Verspoor|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=S|last4=Pearce|first4=J|title=Conceptualising health information seeking behaviours and exploratory search: result of a qualitative study|journal=Health and Technology|date=2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=45-55|doi=10.1007/s12553-015-0096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designing new interfaces===
With one of the motivations being to support users when keyword search is not enough, some research has focused on identifying alternative user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. An example is [[Faceted classification|faceted search]] which presents diverse category-style options to the users, so that they can choose from a list instead of guess a possible keyword query.

Many of the [[human–computer information retrieval|interactive forms of search]], including [[faceted browser]]s, are being considered for their support of exploratory search conditions.

Computational cognitive models of exploratory search have been developed to capture the cognitive complexities involved in exploratory search. Model-based dynamic presentation of information cues are proposed to facilitate exploratory search performance.&lt;ref&gt;Fu, W.-T., Kannampalill, T. G., &amp; Kang, R. (2010). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719970.1719998 Facilitating exploratory search by model-based navigational cues.] In Proceedings of the ACM International conference on Intelligent User Interface. 199–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluating interfaces===
As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are largely undefined or unpredictable, it is very hard to evaluate systems with the measures often used in information retrieval. Accuracy was typically used to show that a user had found a correct answer, but when the user is trying to summarize a domain of information, the ''correct'' answer is near impossible to identify, if not entirely subjective (for example: possible hotels to stay in Paris). In exploration, it is also arguable that spending more time (where time efficiency is typically desirable) researching a topic shows that a system provides increased support for investigation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving study participants a well specified task could immediately prevent them from exhibiting exploratory behavior.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Models of exploratory search behavior===
There have been recent{{When|date=April 2016}} attempts to develop a process model of exploratory search behavior, especially in social information system (e.g., see [[models of collaborative tagging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process model assumes that user-generated information cues, such as social tags, can act as navigational cues that facilitate exploration of information that others have found and shared with other users on a social information system (such as [[social bookmarking]] system). These models provided extension to existing process model of information search that characterizes information-seeking behavior in traditional fact-retrievals using search engines.&lt;ref&gt;

Recent{{When|date=April 2016}} development in exploratory search is often concentrated in predicting users' search intents in interaction with the user.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such predictive user modeling, also referred as intent modeling, can help users to get accustomed to a body of [[domain knowledge]] and help users to make sense of the potential directions to be explored around their initial, often vague, expression of information needs.&lt;ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] noun ''fellatio'' comes from ''{{lang|la|fellātus}}'', which in [[Latin]] is the past [[participle]] of the verb ''{{lang|la|fellāre}}'', meaning to suck. In ''fellatio'' the ''-us'' is replaced by the ''-io''; the declension stem ends in ''-ion-'', which gives the suffix the form ''-ion'' (cf. French ''fellation''). The ''-io''(''n'') ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin [[adjective]]s and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.

Further English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another may be termed a ''fellator''; because of Latin's [[grammatical gender|gender based declension]], this word may be restricted by some English speakers to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is ''fellatrix''.

==Practice==

===General===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (20).jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] of fellatio scene]]
[[File:We, two boys together clinging - 05 - Picture by Giovanni Dall'Orto, July 30 2014.jpg|thumb|Two men engaging in fellatio|150px]]

A person who performs fellatio on someone may be referred to as the giving partner, and the other person as the receiving partner. Fellatio can be [[Sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] for participants, and males commonly experience [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]] of [[semen]] during the act.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; People may use fellatio as [[foreplay]] to sexually arouse their [[sex partner]] before [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal]] intercourse, or other [[sexual activity]],&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; or they may use it as an [[Eroticism|erotic]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate act]] in its own right.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Though a person who receives fellatio is male, his sex partner may be of either sex. When the penis is [[Pelvic thrust|thrust]] into someone's mouth, it may be called ''[[irrumatio]]'', though the term is rarely used.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential aspect of fellatio is for a man's sex partner to take his penis into their mouth, and then move their mouth up and down the penis to a rhythm set by them mimicking the thrusting motion of vaginal or anal intercourse, with saliva acting as a lubricant, and being careful not to bite or scratch with the teeth.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; The man receiving fellatio can slow the rhythm of the stimulation by holding his partner's head. The man's partner may also orally play with his penis by licking, sucking, kissing or otherwise playing with the tongue and lips.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Fellatio may also include the oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth.&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;

It is difficult for some people to perform fellatio, due to their sensitivities to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. [[Deep-throating]] is an act in which a man's partner takes the entire erect penis deep into their mouth, in such a way as to enter their throat.

[[Nancy Friday]]'s book, ''Men in Love – Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage,'' suggests that swallowing semen is high on a man's intimacy scale.&lt;ref&gt;''Men in Love - Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage'' (1982) by [[Nancy Friday]]. {{ISBN|978-0-440-15903-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like [[69 (sex position)|69]] and [[Sex position#Group sex|daisy chain]].

Fellatio is sometimes practiced when penile penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/400_is-it-safe-to-swallow-semen-during-pregnancy_510175_1000.bc |title=Is it safe to swallow semen during pregnancy? |publisher=BabyCenter |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be other reasons why a woman may not wish to have vaginal intercourse, such as apprehension of losing her virginity, of becoming pregnant,&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt; or she may be [[menstruation|menstruating]].

It is physically possible for men who have sufficient flexibility, penis size or a combination of the two to perform fellatio by oneself as a form of [[masturbation]]; this is called [[autofellatio]]. Few men possess sufficient flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary [[frontbend]].&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWmsV0n0mNYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=autofellation+and+really Savage Love]'', page 242 (Plume 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taste and odor===

It may be that "few women praise the taste" of semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bechtel|first1=Stefan|last2=Stains|first2=Laurence Roy|last3=Stains|first3= Larry|title=What Women Want: What Every Man Needs to Know About Sex, Romance, Passion and Pleasure|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Rodale Press|isbn=1579540937|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with [[breast milk]], the taste of semen may be altered by diet.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}} There are anecdotal reports that higher red meat and dairy intake may increase its generally salty taste.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}} Asparagus has been noted to cause bitterness, while parsley, celery, cinnamon, and many kinds of fruit (especially tropical) are noted to sweeten it.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Health aspects==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Pratt| title = HIV &amp; AIDS: A Foundation for Nursing and Healthcare Practice | publisher = [[CRC Press]]|pages=306| isbn = 0340706392|year=2003| accessdate = August 21, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naSG-2RgRiYC&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and Society, Volume 1|isbn =0761479066|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|page=61|year=2010|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oral Sex and HIV Risk |date=June 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/Factsheets/pdf/oralsex.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510210937/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/Factsheets/pdf/oralsex.pdf |archivedate=May 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/hpv/index.htm |title=The HPV Connection |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227175640/http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/hpv/index.htm |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 research study suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/view_news_main.asp?x=5822 |title=Oral Sex Linked To Mouth Cancer Risk |publisher=MedIndia |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study suggested a [[correlation]] between oral sex and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Pregnancy and semen exposure===
{{See also|Paternal tolerance}}

Fellatio cannot result in [[pregnancy]], as there is no way for ingested [[sperm]] to reach the [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s to fertilize an [[ovum|egg]]. At any rate, acids in the stomach and [[digestive enzyme]]s in the [[digestive tract]] break down and kill spermatozoa.

Clinical research has tentatively linked fellatio with immune modulation,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1803978.stm |title=Sex 'primes woman for sperm'. |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-02-06 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating it may reduce the chance of complications during pregnancy. The potentially fatal complication [[pre-eclampsia]] was observed to occur less in women who regularly engaged in fellatio, with those who also ingested their partner's [[semen]] being at the least risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koelman |year=2000 |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: A role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5 |pmid=10706945 |first1=CA |issue=2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were consistent with the fact that semen contains [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]], the exchange of which between partners having a causal reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia caused by an [[immunological]] reaction. It is worth noting that fellatio is not the only viable mechanism for the transmission of [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor RN (1997) "Review: Immunobiology of preeclampsia" American Journal of Reproductive Immunology Volume 37 pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaouat et al., (2005) "Fourth International Workshop on Immunology of Pre-eclampsia, December 2004, Reunion, France" Journal of Reproductive Immunology Volume 67 pp. 103-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==

===Semen ingestion===
{{See also|Semen#Ingestion}}
As late as 1976, some doctors were advising women in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy not to swallow semen lest it induce premature labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pregnant Couple's Guide to Sex, Romance, and Intimacy|author1=Sandra Margot |author2=Tonianne Robino |isbn=978-0-8065-2323-1|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is now known to be safe.

Semen ingestion has had central importance in some cultures around the world. In [[Baruya people|Baruya]] culture, there is a secret ritual in which boys give fellatio to young males and drink their semen, to "re-engender themselves before marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Sambia people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], beginning at age seven all males regularly submit to oral penetration by adolescents in a six-stage initiation process, as the Sambia believe that regular ingestion of an older boy's semen is necessary for a prepubescent youth to achieve sexual maturity and masculinity. By the time he enters mid-puberty he in turn participates in passing his semen on to younger males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Virginity===

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes anal sex, [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002 | pages = 187–191 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSO3q4XEfz4C&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

===Legality===
{{See also|Islamic views on oral sex}}

Fellatio is legal in most countries. Laws of some jurisdictions regard fellatio as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]]. In [[Islam]]ic literature, the only forms of sexual activity that are consistently explicitly prohibited within marriage are anal sex and sexual activity during [[menstrual cycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understanding-islam.com/q-and-a/social-issues/regarding-oral-sex-5555 |title=Regarding 'Oral Sex' |publisher=Understanding-islam.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact attitude towards oral sex is a subject of disagreements between modern scholars of Islam.

In [[Malaysia]], fellatio is illegal, but the law is seldom enforced. Under Malaysia's Section 377A of the Penal Code, the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of another person is considered a "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" and is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years maximum and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2010|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/3/1/focus/3375398&amp;sec=focus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622074655/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F3%2F1%2Ffocus%2F3375398&amp;sec=focus|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 22, 2011|title=Illegal but not abnormal|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[India|Ancient Indian]] [[Kama Sutra]], dating from the first century AD, describes oral sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm |title=The actual kama sutra or kamasutra: Part II: On Sexual Union: Chapter IX.

However, according to the Kama Sutra, fellatio is above all a characteristic of [[eunuch]]s (or, according to other translations, of [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] or [[Trans woman|transwomen]] similar to the modern [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India), who use their mouths as a substitute for female [[Sex organ|genitalia]].

The author of the Kama Sutra states that it is also practiced by "unchaste women", but mentions that there are widespread traditional concerns about this being a degrading or unclean practice, with known practitioners being evaded as love partners in large parts of the country. The author appears to somewhat agree with these attitudes, claiming that "a wise man" should not engage in that form of intercourse while acknowledging that it can be appropriate in some unspecified cases.

'''Feminist political ecology''' is a [[feminist]] perspective on [[political ecology]], drawing on theories from  [[post-structuralism]], [[feminist geography]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Feminist political ecology examines the place of gender in the political ecological landscape, exploring gender as a factor in ecological and political relations. Specific areas in which feminist political ecology is focused are development, landscape, resource use, [[Agrarianism|agrarian reconstruction]] and [[Urbanization|rural-urban transformation]] (Hovorka 2006: 209).  Feminist political ecologists suggest gender is a crucial variable – in relation to class, race and other relevant dimensions of political ecological life – in constituting access to, control over, and knowledge of natural resources.

== Linking gender hierarchy with environmental degradation ==

Feminist political ecology attempts to include gender as a "key element" in  political ecology analysis (Hovorka 2006: 209). It is informed by several decades of feminist scholarship on the material and cultural links between gender hierarchy (where the masculine is valued more than the feminine) and the domination of the natural world. Ecological feminist scholars working in different disciplines, such as Carolyn Merchant (1980), [[Val Plumwood]] (1993; 2002) and Vandana Shiva (1989), laid the foundations for this field by providing empirical evidence and conceptual tools for the systematic analysis of the twin devaluation/domination of nature and the feminine.

== Research ==

The study of the relationship between environments, gender, and development has grown in importance because of the restructuring of economies, environments and cultures at a global and local level (Mitchell 2000). Women and men are being viewed as actors who affect environmental management, resource use, and the creation of policies for health and well-being. Feminist political ecology does not view gender differences in environmental impact as being biologically-rooted. Rather, they are derived from social constructs of gender, which vary depending on culture, class, race, and geographical location, and they change over time between individuals and societies. A key moment on the development of the approach was the publication of ''Feminist Political Ecology'', edited by Dianne Rocheleau ''et.al.'' at [[Clark University]] in 1996. The book showed how usage of environment and labor patterns are gendered, but also how certain environmental problems have particularly negative effects on women (Rocheleau ''et al.'' 1996). These concerns were largely absent in the better-known [[political ecology]] volume ''Liberation Ecologies'', which was published in the same year and also developed at Clark (Peet &amp; Watts, 1996).

In a study on the [[Rural Federation of Zambrana-Chacuey]] (a peasant federation) and an international nongovernmental organization ([[ENDA-Caribe]]) in the Dominican Republic, [[Dianne Rocheleau]] examines social forestry within the region. Women are involved in the forestry industry, but previous research (summary numbers, "regional maps of forestry-as-usual" (Rocheleau 1995: 460) had not represented the "different publics (differentiated by gender, class, locality, and occupation) within the Federation (p460)". Rocheleau's study draws upon post-structuralism to "expand our respective partial and situated knowledges through a politics a science that go beyond identity to affinities then work from affinities to coalitions" (p459).In other words, the study does not assume that the identity of a person defines them, but instead focuses on "affinities" (defined as "based on affiliations, and shared views of interests, subject to change over time"). The purpose of this was to "address women within the context in which they had organized and affiliated themselves (p461)". The purpose of the study was to include women in the general study of the area in a way that gave justice to the "ecological and social contexts that sustain their lives" (p461), instead of separating them from the context, rendering them invisible.

In a Botswana study on urban poultry agriculture, [[Alice J. Hovorka]] (2006) examines the implications of fast-paced urbanization on social and ecological relations in a Feminist Political Ecology framework. Men and women are both involved and affected by development issues, so therefore "gender is an integral part of a key element of agrarian change and rural-urban transformation" (Hovorka 2006:209). Before urbanization took off, socially constructed gender roles played a huge part in gendered experiences of the landscape. Gender determined the different roles, responsibilities and access to resources. It is important to note that although Botswana women gained the right to vote in 1966, they remain excluded from political power. Gender issues are rarely raised in this country where "powerful conventions restrict women's domain to the household and women's autonomy under male guardianship" (p211). With urbanization, land use is becoming more accessible to Botswana women. But studies have revealed that "women's access to social status and productive resources remains limited compared to men's" (p213). Traditional gender roles affect women's economic situation, their access to resources and land, their education, and their labor market.

== Quotes on feminist political ecology ==

* New research in feminist political ecology moves "from a focus on women's vulnerabilities and the silencing of gendered and subaltern knowledges to stress the global significance of women's embodied practices, emerging social movements, and collaborative action". —Stephanie Buechler and Anne-Marie Hanson (2015)
* "Feminist Political Ecology aims at analyzing gendered experiences of and responses to environmental and political-economic change that brings with it changing livelihoods, landscapes, property regimes, and social relations." —Alice Hovorka (2006)
* "Rather than "adding women" to standard methods of empirical research it was possible to include gender as a subject of study, to incorporate feminist post-structuralist perspective into the research design, and to apply it to an analysis of social and environmental change within the region." —Dianne Rocheleau 1995.
* "My first feminist paper was published, out of research I did in the late 1970s on sex difference in migration and social change in rural Puerto Rica. It had to do with how rural industrialization, reflecting US development policies, was affecting who stayed and who left. And how class and gender intersected with migration patterns in rural Puerto Rico." —Jan Monk

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41474">The '''fine-tuned universe''' is the proposition that the conditions that allow [[life]] in the [[universe]] can occur only when certain universal [[dimensionless physical constant]]s lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name= ":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe|last = Rees|first = Martin |publisher = Basic Books | edition= 1st American |date = May 3, 2001 |location = New York, NY |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe Is Just Right for Life|last = Davis |first = Paul|publisher = Orion Publications |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-61859226-5 |location = New York, NY |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Various possible explanations of ostensible fine-tuning are discussed among [[philosopher]]s, [[scientists]], [[theologians]], and proponents and detractors of [[creationism]]. The fine-tuned universe observation is closely related to, but is not exactly synonymous with, the [[anthropic principle]], which is often used as an explanation of apparent fine-tuning.

== History ==
In 1913, the [[chemist]] [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] (1878–1942) wrote ''The Fitness of the Environment,'' one of the first books to explore concepts of fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of [[water]] and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] with respect to living things, pointing out that life depends entirely on the very specific environmental conditions on Earth, especially with regard to the prevalence and properties of water.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Joseph Henderson, ''The fitness of the environment: an inquiry into the biological significance of the properties of matter'' The Macmillan Company, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, physicist [[Robert H. Dicke]] claimed that certain forces in [[physics]], such as [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]], must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist anywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Dicke&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = R.

L. ''The Oxford guide to the history of physics and astronomy, Volume 10'' 2005, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1984 book ''Intelligent Universe''. He compares "the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of [[amino acids]] to a [[star system]] full of blind men solving [[Rubik's Cube]] simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optcorp.com/edu/articleDetailEDU.aspx?aid=1530 Profile of Fred Hoyle at OPT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406200054/http://www.optcorp.com/edu/articleDetailEDU.aspx?aid=1530 |date=2012-04-06 }}.

[[John Gribbin]] and [[Martin Rees]] wrote a detailed history and defence of the fine-tuning argument in their book ''Cosmic Coincidences'' (1989). According to Gribbin and Rees, "The conditions in our Universe really do seem to be uniquely suitable for life forms like ourselves, and perhaps even for any form of organic complexity. But the question remains - ''is'' the Universe tailor-made for man?"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gribbin. J and Rees.

== Premise ==
The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the dimensionless physical constants would make the universe radically different. As [[Stephen Hawking]] has noted, "The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron. ... The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], 1988. ''A Brief History of Time,'' Bantam Books, {{ISBN|0-553-05340-X}}, p. 7, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, for example, the strong nuclear force were 2% stronger than it is (i.e. if the [[coupling constant]] representing its strength were 2% larger), while the other constants were left unchanged, [[diproton]]s would be stable; according to physicist [[Paul Davies]], hydrogen would [[hydrogen fusion|fuse]] into them instead of [[deuterium]] and [[helium]].&lt;ref name=Davies1993&gt;Paul Davies, 1993. ''The Accidental Universe'', Cambridge University Press, p70-71&lt;/ref&gt; This would drastically alter the physics of [[star]]s, and presumably preclude the existence of life similar to what we observe on Earth. The existence of the diproton would short-circuit the slow fusion of hydrogen into deuterium. Hydrogen would fuse so easily that it is likely that all of the universe's hydrogen would be consumed in the first few minutes after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=Davies1993/&gt; This "diproton argument" is disputed by other physicists, who calculate that as long as the increase in strength is less than 50%, stellar fusion could occur despite the existence of stable diprotons.&lt;ref name =macdonald&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDonald | first1 = J. | last2 = Mullan | first2 = D.

The precise formulation of the idea is made difficult by the fact that physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current [[standard model of particle physics]] has 25 freely adjustable parameters and [[general relativity]] has one additional parameter, the [[cosmological constant]], which is [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|known to be non-zero]], but profoundly small in value. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both [[quantum mechanics]] and [[General Relativity Theory|general relativity]] are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a [[Grand Unified Theory|grand unified theory]], [[string theory]], or [[loop quantum gravity]]. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, "the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the [[Standard Model of particle physics]], the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Larry | date = 1991 | title = The Mystery of the Cosmological Constant | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 3 | issue = 1| page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Martin Rees]] formulates the fine-tuning of the universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemley|first1=Brad|title=Why is There Life?|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/nov/cover/|accessdate=23 August 2014|publisher=[[Discover magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''N'', the ratio of the [[Fine structure constant|strength of electromagnetism]] to the [[Gravitational coupling constant|strength of gravity]] for a pair of protons, is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;. According to Rees, if it were significantly smaller, only a small and short-lived universe could exist.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Epsilon'' (ε), a measure of the nuclear efficiency of [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|fusion from hydrogen to helium]], is 0.007: when four nucleons fuse into helium, 0.007 (0.7%) of their mass is converted to energy. The value of ε is in part determined by the strength of the [[strong nuclear force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Ian|title=Introduction to astronomy and cosmology|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118681527|chapter=9.14: A universe fit for intelligent life}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If ε were 0.006, only hydrogen could exist, and complex chemistry would be impossible. According to Rees, if it were above 0.008, no hydrogen would exist, as all the hydrogen would have been fused shortly after the [[big bang]]. Other physicists disagree, calculating that substantial hydrogen remains as long as the strong force coupling constant increases by less than about 50%.&lt;ref name=macdonald /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Omega'' (Ω), commonly known as the [[Density parameter#Density parameter|density parameter]], is the relative importance of gravity and expansion energy in the universe. It is the ratio of the mass density of the universe to the "critical density" and is approximately 1. If gravity were too strong compared with dark energy and the initial metric expansion, the universe would have collapsed before life could have evolved. On the other side, if gravity were too weak, no stars would have formed.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] and [[Michio Kaku]] | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Lambda'' (λ), commonly known as the [[cosmological constant]], describes the ratio of the density of [[dark energy]] to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of [[Planck units]], and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant, λ, is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Barrow]] [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3105 The Value of the Cosmological Constant]&lt;/ref&gt; This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. If the cosmological constant were not extremely small, stars and other astronomical structures would not be able to form.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Q'', the ratio of the gravitational energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;. If it is too small, no stars can form. If it is too large, no stars can survive because the universe is too violent, according to Rees.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''D'', the number of spatial [[dimension]]s in [[spacetime]], is 3. Rees claims that life could not exist if there were 2 or 4 dimensions of spacetime nor if any other than 1 time dimension existed in spacetime.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;

=== Carbon and oxygen ===
{{Further|Triple-alpha process#Improbability and fine-tuning}}

An older example is the [[Hoyle state]], the third-lowest energy state of the [[carbon-12]] nucleus, with an energy of 7.656 MeV above the ground level. According to one calculation, if the state's energy level was lower than 7.3 or greater than 7.9 MeV, insufficient carbon would exist to support life. Furthermore, to explain the universe's abundance of carbon, the Hoyle state must be further tuned to a value between 7.596 and 7.716 MeV. A similar calculation, focusing on the underlying fundamental constants that give rise to various energy levels, concludes that the [[strong force]] must be tuned to a precision of at least 0.5%, and the electromagnetic force to a precision of at least 4%, to prevent either carbon production or oxygen production from dropping significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livio|first1=M.|last2=Hollowell|first2=D.|last3=Weiss|first3=A.|last4=Truran|first4=J.

== Disputes regarding the existence and extent of fine-tuning ==
Physicist [[Paul Davies]] has asserted that "There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the universe is in several respects 'fine-tuned' for life". However, he continues, "the conclusion is not so much that the universe is fine-tuned for life; rather it is fine-tuned for the building blocks and environments that life requires." He also states that {{" '}}[[Anthropic principle|anthropic]]' reasoning fails to distinguish between minimally biophilic universes, in which life is permitted, but only marginally possible, and optimally biophilic universes, in which life flourishes because [[abiogenesis]] occurs frequently".&lt;ref name=Davies200&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies |title=How bio-friendly is the universe |date=2003 |volume=2 |issue=115 |journal=Int. J. Astrobiol. |arxiv=astro-ph/0403050 |doi=10.1017/S1473550403001514 |page=115|bibcode = 2003IJAsB...2..115D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among scientists who find the evidence persuasive, a variety of explanations have been proposed, such as the [[anthropic principle]] along with [[multiverse|multiple universes]].  [[George F. R. Ellis]] states "that no possible astronomical observations can ever see those other universes. The arguments are indirect at best. And even if the [[multiverse]] exists, it leaves the deep mysteries of nature unexplained."&lt;ref&gt;George F. R. Ellis, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-multiverse-really-exist "Does the Multiverse Really Exist?"] Scientific American&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding recently discovered [[dark energy]] and its implication on the [[cosmological constant]], [[Leonard Susskind]] says "The great mystery is not why there is dark energy. The great mystery is why there is [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|so little of it]] [10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;]...  The fact that we are just on the knife edge of existence, [that] if dark energy were very much bigger we wouldn’t be here, that's the mystery." A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused [[spacetime|space]] to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form.&lt;ref name=susskind&gt;{{cite web|last=Ananthaswamy|first=Anil|authorlink=Anil Ananthaswamy|title=Is the Universe Fine-Tuned for Life? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2012/03/is-the-universe-fine-tuned-for-life/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the "megaverse" in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=American Scientist |title=An interview with Leonard Susskind |first1=Greg |last1=Ross|year=2015|url= http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/leonard-susskind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Weinberg]] rejects the argument about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that "the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine". He acknowledges that he currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the smallness of the cosmological constant, but cautions that "It is still too early to tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=physlink.com |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |title=A Designer Universe? |year=1999 |url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Public Broadcasting System, pbs.org |title=Interview |url=https://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/transcript/wein-frame.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Victor Stenger]] objected to the fine-tuning, and especially to [[theist]] use of fine-tuning arguments. His numerous criticisms included what he called "the wholly [[carbon chauvinism|unwarranted assumption that only carbon-based life is possible]]."&lt;ref name=stenger&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger|title=Is The Universe Fine-Tuned For Us?|url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf#search=%22Fine%20tuned%20universe%22|publisher=University of Colorado|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192004/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf#search=%22Fine%20tuned%20universe%22|archivedate=2012-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the astrophysicist Luke Barnes has criticised much of Stenger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | arxiv=1112.4647 | author1=Barnes | title=The Fine-Tuning of the Universe for Intelligent Life | date=2011 | doi=10.1071/AS12015 | volume=29 | issue=4 | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia | pages=529–564| bibcode=2012PASA...29..529B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of [[fine tuning]] examples is sometimes questioned on the grounds that such reasoning is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[anthropomorphism]] applied to [[Natural science|natural]] physical constants. Critics also suggest that the fine-tuned universe assertion and the anthropic principle are essentially [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last=Silk|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Silk|title=Our place in the Multiverse|journal=Nature|date=September 14, 2006|volume= 443|issue= 7108|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7108/full/443145a.html|doi=10.1038/443145a|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..145S|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine-tuned universe argument has also been criticized as an [[Argument from ignorance|argument by lack of imagination]], as it assumes no other forms of life, sometimes referred to as [[carbon chauvinism]]. Conceptually, [[alternative biochemistry]] or other forms of life are possible.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart: ''What Does a Martian Look Like: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life'', Wiley, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this, Stenger argued: "We have no reason to believe that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that [[Multiverse|multiple universes]] may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, it is [[selection bias|not surprising that we live in the one suited for us]]. The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger|title=Flew's Flawed Science|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/vstenger/flew.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, critics argue that humans are adapted to the universe through the process of evolution, rather than the universe being adapted to humans (see [[#In popular culture|puddle thinking]], below). They also see it as an example of the logical flaw of [[hubris]] or [[anthropocentrism]] in its assertion that humans are the purpose of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro, "A Puddlian Fable" in Huchingson, ''Religion and the Natural Sciences'' (1993), pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible naturalistic explanations ==
There are [[Anthropic principle#String theory|fine tuning arguments]] that are [[Metaphysical naturalism#Undesigned universe|naturalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Susskind, ''The cosmic landscape: string theory and the illusion of intelligent design''. (Little, Brown, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} As modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses have been proposed. One is an [[Cyclic model|oscillatory universe]] or a [[multiverse]], where fundamental physical constants are postulated to resolve themselves to [[random]] values in different [[iteration]]s of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J. A. (1977) in ''Foundational problems in the special sciences'', Reidel, Dordrecht, pp 3–33&lt;/ref&gt; Under this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the appearance of fine-tuning is explained as a consequence of the weak [[anthropic principle]] and [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]) that only those universes with fundamental constants hospitable to life (such as the universe we observe) would have living beings emerge and evolve capable of contemplating the questions of origins and of fine-tuning. All other universes would go utterly unbeheld by any such beings.

=== Multiverse ===
{{Main|Multiverse}}

The Multiverse hypothesis proposes the existence of many universes with different physical constants, some of which are hospitable to intelligent life (see [[multiverse#Anthropic principle|multiverse: anthropic principle]]). Because we are intelligent beings, it is unsurprising that we find ourselves in a hospitable universe if there is such a multiverse. The Multiverse hypothesis is therefore thought to provide an elegant explanation of the finding that we exist despite the required fine-tuning. (See &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/fine-tuning/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Friederich|first=Simon|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a detailed discussion of the arguments for and against this suggested explanation.)

The multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the [[anthropic principle]] and has been of particular interest to [[particle physics|particle physicist]]s, because [[theory of everything|theories of everything]] do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory do make predictions that some researchers studying [[M-theory]] and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence of soon.&lt;ref name = "Michio Kaku"&gt;''Parallel Worlds'',2005, [[Michio Kaku]], pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Some multiverse theories are not [[falsifiable]], thus scientists may be reluctant to call any multiverse theory "scientific". [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]] professor [[Laura Mersini|Laura Mersini-Houghton]] claims that the [[WMAP cold spot#Parallel universe|WMAP cold spot]] may provide testable empirical evidence for a [[multiverse|parallel universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj |title=Two Programmes – Horizon, 2010–2011, What Happened Before the Big Bang? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this claim was recently refuted as the WMAP cold spot was found to be nothing more than a statistical artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Disks in the sky: A reassessment of the WMAP "cold spot" | journal = Astroparticle Physics | first = Ray | last = Zhang |author2=Dragan Hunterer | volume = 33 | issue = 69 (2010) | doi = 10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.11.005 | arxiv = 0908.3988v2 | year = 2010 | pages = 69|bibcode = 2010APh....33...69Z | citeseerx = 10.1.1.249.6944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Variants on this approach include [[Lee Smolin]]'s notion of cosmological [[natural selection]], the [[Ekpyrotic]] universe, and the Bubble universe theory.

Critics of the multiverse-related explanations argue that there is no independent evidence that other universes exist. Some criticize the inference from fine-tuning for life to a multiverse as fallacious,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Roger|date=2000-06-01|title=Fine-Tuning and Multiple Universes|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=260–276|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.00210|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others defend it against that challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Darren|date=2009|title=Multiple Universes and Observation Selection Effects|jstor=20464437|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=46|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.2307/20464437|doi-broken-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Top-down cosmology ===
[[Stephen Hawking]], along with Thomas Hertog of [[CERN]], proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One hypothesis is that the universe may have been designed by extra-universal [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s.

However it also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an [[infinite regress]].

The Designer Universe theory of [[John Gribbin]] suggests that the universe could have been made deliberately by an advanced civilization in another part of the [[Multiverse]], and that this civilization may have been responsible for causing the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin, In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality, 2010, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical arguments ==

As with [[theistic evolution]], some individual scientists, [[theologian]]s, and [[philosopher]]s as well as certain religious groups argue that [[Divine Providence|providence]] or [[Creation myth|creation]] are responsible for fine-tuning.

Christian philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that random chance, applied to a single and sole universe, only raises the question as to why this universe could be so "lucky" as to have precise conditions that support life at least at some place (the Earth) and time (within millions of years of the present). {{quote|One reaction to these apparent enormous [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|coincidences]] is to see them as substantiating the theistic claim that the universe has been created by a personal God and as offering the material for a properly restrained theistic argument—hence the fine-tuning argument. It's as if there are a large number of dials that have to be tuned to within extremely narrow limits for life to be possible in our universe. It is extremely unlikely that this should happen by chance, but much more likely that this should happen, if there is such a person as God.|Alvin Plantinga|"The Dawkins Confusion; Naturalism ad absurdum"&lt;ref name=Plantinga&gt;Alvin Plantinga, [http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/DawkinsGodDelusionPlantingaReview.pdf "The Dawkins Confusion; Naturalism ad absurdum,"] ''Christianity Today'', March/April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This fine-tuning of the universe is cited&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;William Lane Craig, [http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/teleo.html "The Teleological Argument and the Anthropic Principle"]. leaderu.com&lt;/ref&gt; by philosopher and Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] as an [[Argument from design|evidence]] for the existence of [[God]] or some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]] capable of manipulating (or designing) the basic [[physics]] that governs the universe. Craig argues, however, "that the postulate of a divine Designer does not settle for us the religious question."

Philosopher and theologian [[Richard Swinburne]] reaches the design conclusion using [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]], 1990.

Scientist and theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature’s ability to tune itself to any degree.&lt;blockquote&gt;[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). […] Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister E.|title=A fine-tuned universe : the quest for God in science and theology|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY.|isbn=978-0664233105|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning|title=What is the "fine-tuning" of the universe, and how does it serve as a "pointer to God"?|website=BioLogos.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221081439/http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning|archivedate=2014-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theoretical physicist and Anglican priest [[John Polkinghorne]] has stated: "Anthropic fine tuning is too remarkable to be dismissed as just a happy accident."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, John (1998) Science and Theology: An Introduction p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligent design ===
Proponents of [[intelligent design]] argue that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an [[intelligent designer|intelligent cause]], not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]. The fine-tuned universe argument is a central premise or presented as given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Michael Behe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Counterarguments ===
Mark Colyvan, Jay Garfield and [[Graham Priest]] (2005) have argued that a theistic explanation for fine tuning is faulted due to fallacious probabilistic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan ''et al''. (2005). [http://www.colyvan.com/papers/finetuning.pdf ''Problems with the Argument from Fine Tuning'']. Synthese 145: 325-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematician Michael Ikeda and astronomer [[William H. Jefferys]] have argued that the anthropic principle and [[selection effect]] are not properly taken into account in the fine tuning argument for a designer, and that in taking them into account, fine tuning does not support the designer hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism], Michael Ikeda, Bill Jefferys&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ikeda]] and [[William H. Jefferys]], "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150–166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] makes a similar argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott Sober]], 2004. ''The Design Argument'', in The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion, W. E. Mann, Editor. Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-22129-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Robert L. Park]] has also criticized the theistic interpretation of fine-tuning:

{{quote|If the universe was designed for life, it must be said that it is a shockingly inefficient design. There are vast reaches of the universe in which life as we know it is clearly impossible: gravitational forces would be crushing, or radiation levels are too high for complex molecules to exist, or temperatures would make the formation of stable chemical bonds impossible... Fine-tuned for life? It would make more sense to ask why God designed a universe so inhospitable to life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L]]. (2009). ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''. [[Princeton University Press]]. p. 11. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13355-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Victor Stenger argues that "The fine-tuning argument and other recent intelligent design arguments are modern versions of [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] reasoning, where a God is deemed necessary whenever science has not fully explained some phenomenon".&lt;ref name="stenger"/&gt; Stenger argues that science may provide an explanation if a Theory of Everything is formulated, which he says may reveal connections between the physical constants. A change in one physical constant may be compensated by a change in another, suggesting that the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is a fallacy because, in hypothesizing the apparent fine-tuning, it is mistaken to vary one physical parameter while keeping the others constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chown|first=Marcus|authorlink=Marcus Chown|title=Why the universe wasn't fine-tuned for life|journal=New Scientist|date=14 June 2011|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2011/06/why-the-universe-wasnt-fine-tuned-for-life.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Puddle theory'' is a term coined by [[Douglas Adams]] to satirize arguments that the universe is made for man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1572643.htm|title=The anthropic universe|last=Williams|first=Robyn|date=18 February 2006|work=The Science Show|publisher=ABC Radio National|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/proofs-of-god-in-a-photon-1527306.html | title=Proofs of God in a photon | last=Redfern | first=Martin|date=24 December 1995 | work=The Independent | accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in Adams' book ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDchCdg9K-8C&amp;q=imagine+a+puddle#v=snippet&amp;q=imagine%20a%20puddle&amp;f=false |publisher=Harmony Books |page=131 |isbn= 9781400045082|accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, “This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!” This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Forensic entomology''' is the scientific study of the invasion of the succession pattern of [[arthropods]] with their developmental stages of different species found on the decomposed cadavers during legal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verma K, Paul R | title= ''Lucilia sericata'' (Meigen) and ''Chrysomya megacephala'' (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Development Rate and its Implications for Forensic Entomology | journal= J Forensic Sci Med | year=2016 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=146–150 | doi=10.4103/2349-5014.191466}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the application and study of [[insect]] and other [[arthropod]] biology to criminal matters. It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases. It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds. Forensic [[entomology]] can be divided into three subfields: [[Forensic entomology#Urban forensic entomology|urban]], [[Home stored product entomology|stored-product]] and [[Forensic entomology#Medico-legal forensic entomology|medico-legal/medico-criminal]] entomology.

==History==
Historically, there have been several accounts of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. The concept of forensic entomology dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in [[criminal investigation]]s. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, [[Sung Tzu]], [[Francesco Redi]], [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret|Bergeret d’Arbois]], [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]] and the physiologist [[Hermann Reinhard]] have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology.

===Song Ci===
The Song Dynasty (960–1279) [[forensic science]] book ''[[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified]]'' published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer [[Song Ci]] in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"&gt;Haskell (2006), 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In a murder case of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a [[sickle]]; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in the town square where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; Within minutes, a mass of [[Blow-fly|blow flies]] gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of [[blood]] unseen by the naked eye.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt;

Song Ci (sometimes referred to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled ''[[Washing Away of Wrongs]]'' as a handbook for coroners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=T'and-Yin-Pi-Shih: Parallel cases from under the pear-tree | author=R.H. van Gulik | authorlink=Robert van Gulik | edition=reprint | publisher=Gibson Press | origyear=1956| year=2004 | isbn=0-88355-908-0 | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on how a person died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse both before and after burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was to be used as a guide for other investigators so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tz’u., B.E. Mc Knight 1981, The Washing Away Of Wrongs, Center for Chinese Studies The University of Michigan, Pages 1-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francesco Redi===
{{further|Francesco Redi}}
In 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi disproved the theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that [[maggots]] developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, he used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly [[maggots]], whereas rotting meat that was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the way people viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://microbes.historique.net/history2.html | title=A History of Microbiology | publisher=Historique.net | date=30 April 2003 | accessdate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bergeret d'Arbois===
Dr. [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret]] (1814–1893) was a French hospital physician, and was the first to apply forensic entomology to a case. In a case report published in 1855 he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI). His report used forensic entomology as tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermann Reinhard===
The first systematic study in forensic entomology was conducted in 1881 by [[Hermann Reinhard]], a German medical doctor who played a vital role in the history of forensic entomology. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different types of insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in east Germany, and collected many [[Phoridae|Phorid flies]] from this initial study. He also concluded that the development of only some of the insects living with corpses underground were associated with them, since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with them. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.

===Jean Pierre Mégnin===
{{further|Jean Pierre Mégnin}}
French veterinarian and entomologist  Jean Pierre Mégnin (1828–1905), published many articles and books on various subjects including the books ''Faune des Tombeaux'' and ''La Faune des Cadavres'', which are considered to be among the most important forensic entomology books in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klotzbach H, Krettek R | title=The history of forensic entomology in German-speaking countries | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2004 | volume=144 | issue=2–3 | pages=259–263 | pmid=15364399  | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.04.062|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second book he did revolutionary work on the theory of predictable waves, or successions of insects onto corpses. By counting numbers of live and dead mites that developed every 15 days and comparing this with his initial count on the infant, he was able to estimate how long that infant was dead.&lt;ref name=Benecke/&gt;

In this book, he asserted that exposed corpses were subject to eight successional waves, whereas buried corpses were only subject to two waves. Mégnin made many great discoveries that helped shed new light on many of the general characteristics of decaying flora and fauna. Mégnin's work and study of the larval and adult forms of insect families found in cadavers sparked the interest of future entomologists and encouraged more research in the link between arthropods and the deceased, and thereby helped to establish the scientific discipline of forensic entomology.

==Forensic entomology subfields==

===Urban forensic entomology===
Urban forensic entomology typically concerns pests infestations in buildings gardens or that may be the basis of litigation between private parties and service providers such as landlords or exterminators.&lt;ref name="Catts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Catts |first=E. P. |authorlink= |author2=Goff, M. L. |date=January 1992| title = Forensic Entomology in Criminal Investigations|journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=37 |issue= |pages=253–272 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.37.010192.001345 |url= |quote=|pmid=1539937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban forensic entomology studies may also indicate the appropriateness of certain pesticide treatments and may also be used in stored products cases where it can help to determine chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation are examined in order to determine who is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Bledsoe 2008, personal interview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stored-product forensic entomology===
{{further|Home stored product entomology}}
Stored-product forensic entomology is often used in litigation over insect infestation or contamination of commercially distributed foods.&lt;ref name="Catts"/&gt;

===Medico-legal forensic entomology===
Medicolegal forensic entomology covers evidence gathered through arthropod studies at the scenes of murder, suicide, rape, physical abuse and contraband trafficking.&lt;ref name="Catts" /&gt; In murder investigations it deals with which [[insect]]s eggs appear, their location on the body and in what order they appear. This can be helpful in determining a [[post mortem interval]] (PMI) and location of a [[death]] in question. Since many insects exhibit a degree of [[endemism]] (occurring only in certain places), or have a well-defined [[phenology]] (active only at a certain season, or time of day), their presence in association with other evidence can demonstrate potential links to times and locations where other events may have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;https://peerj.com/articles/3506/?td=wk | Use of necrophagous insects as evidence of cadaver relocation: myth or reality?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |title=Insects help convict killer |accessdate=1 April 2008 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820070919/http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area covered by medicolegal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of [[entomotoxicology]]. This particular branch involves the utilization of entomological specimens found at a scene in order to test for different drugs that may have possibly played a role in the death of the victim.

===Scorpionflies===

Scorpionflies (order [[Mecoptera]]) were the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver observed (by the entomologist Natalie Lindgren) at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility near [[Huntsville, Texas]], and remained on the corpse for one and a half days, outnumbering flies during that period.

[[Calliphora latifrons|Flies]] (order [[Diptera]]) are often first on the scene. They prefer a moist corpse for their offspring (maggots) to feed on. The most significant types of fly include:

*Blow flies – Family [[Calliphoridae]]- Flies in this family are often metallic in appearance and between 10 and 14&amp;nbsp;mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as [[Calliphora latifrons|blue bottle fly]], [[cluster fly]], [[Green bottle fly|greenbottle]]s, or [[Protophormia terraenovae|black blowfly]]. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. [[Larva]]e have three stages of development (called [[instars]]); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the [[Neotropics]], and a large number of species in [[Africa]] and Southern [[Europe]]. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Central America]], and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first [[insect]] to come in contact with [[carrion]] because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/23/flies-murder-natural-history-museum |title=Lord of the flies: the insect detectives |vauthors = Henley J |date=September 23, 2010 |website=The Guardian |publisher= Guardian News and Media Ltd |access-date=November 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarcophaga nodosa.jpg|thumb|220px|Flesh fly on decomposing flesh]]
*Flesh flies – Family [[Sarcophagidae]]- Most flesh flies breed in carrion, dung, garbage, or decaying material, but a few species lay their eggs in the open wounds of mammals; hence their common name. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Most [[holarctic]] Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18&amp;nbsp;mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the [[thorax]] and checkering on the [[abdomen]]. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on [[corpses]] of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).
*[[Housefly|House fly]] – Family [[Muscidae]]- is the most common of all [[flies]] found in homes, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects; it is often considered a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] that can carry serious diseases. The adults are 6–9&amp;nbsp;mm long. Their [[thorax]] is gray, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair.  Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs in several batches of about 75 to 150 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. Genus ''[[Hydrotaea]]'' are of particular forensic importance.
*Cheese flies – Family [[Piophilidae]] - Most are scavengers in animal products and fungi. The best-known member of the family is ''[[Piophila casei]]''. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly [[iridescent]] and lie flat upon the fly's [[abdomen]] when at rest. At four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common [[housefly]].
*Coffin flies – [[Phoridae]]
*Lesser corpse flies – [[Sphaeroceridae]]
*Lesser house flies – [[Fanniidae]]
*Black scavenger flies – [[Sepsidae]]
*Sun flies - [[Heleomyzidae]]
*[[Black soldier fly]] - [[Stratiomyidae]] - have potential for use in forensic entomology. The larvae are common [[scavengers]] in compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in honey bee hives, and are used in [[manure]] management (for both [[house fly]] control and reduction in manure volume). The larvae range in size from 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a [[mimic]], very close in size, color, and appearance to the [[organ pipe mud dauber]] wasp and its relatives.
*Phoridae – Humpbacked flies&lt;br /&gt;Larvae feed on decaying bodies. Some species can burrow to a depth of 50&amp;nbsp;cm over 4 days. Important in buried bodies.
*Non-biting midges - [[Chironomidae]] - these flies have a complex life cycle. While adults are terrestrial and phytophagous, larvae are aquatic and detritivorous. Immature instars have been used as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beetles===

[[Beetle]]s (Order [[Coleoptera]]) are generally found on the corpse when it is more decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley JM, Richards CS, Villet MH, 2010. The utility of Coleoptera in forensic investigations. In: Amendt J, Campobasso CP, Goff ML, Grassberger M, eds. Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies ([[Psychodidae]]).

*Rove beetles – family [[Staphylinidae]] – are elongate beetles with small [[elytra]] (wing covers) and large jaws. Like other beetles inhabiting carrion, they have fast [[larval]] development with only three larval stages. [[Creophilus]] species are common predators of carrion, and since they are large, are a very visible component of the fauna of corpses. Some adult Staphylinidae are early visitors to a corpse, feeding on larvae of all species of fly, including the later predatory fly larvae. They lay their eggs in the corpse, and the emerging larvae are also predators. Some species have a long development time in the egg, and are common only during the later stages of decomposition. Staphylinids can also tear open the [[pupa]]l cases of flies, to sustain themselves at a corpse for long periods.
*Hister beetles – family [[Histeridae]]. Adult histerids are usually shiny beetles (black or metallic-green) which have an introverted head. The carrion-feeding species only become active at night when they enter the maggot-infested part of the corpse to capture and devour their maggot prey. During daylight they hide under the corpse unless it is sufficiently decayed to enable them to hide inside it. They have fast larval development with only two larval stages. Among the first beetles to arrive at a corpse are Histeridae of the genus ''[[Saprinus]]''. ''Saprinus'' adults feed on both the larvae and pupae of [[blowflies]], although some have a preference for fresh pupae. The adults lay their eggs in the corpse, inhabiting it in the later stages of decay.
*Carrion beetles – family [[Silphidae]]- Adult Silphidae have an average size of about 12&amp;nbsp;mm. They are also referred to as burying beetles because they dig and bury small carcasses underground.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Michelle Pellissier |date=January 1998 |title=The ecology and behavior of burying beetles |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.595 |pages=595–618 |pmid=15012399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents tend to their young and exhibit communial breeding. The male carrion beetle's job in care is to provide protection for the breed and carcass from competitors.
*Ham beetles – family [[Cleridae]]
*Carcass beetles – family [[Trogidae]]
* Skin/hide beetles – family [[Dermestidae]]. Hide beetles are important in the final stages of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin, tendons and bone left by fly larvae. Hide beetles are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down [[keratin]], a protein component of hair.
*Scarab beetles – family [[Scarabaeidae]]- Scarab beetles may be any one of around 30,000 beetle species worldwide that are compact, heavy-bodied and oval in shape. The flattened plates, which each antenna terminates, are fitted together to form a club. The outer edges of the front legs may also be toothed or scalloped. Scarab beetles range from {{convert|0.2|to|4.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length. These species are known for being one of the heaviest insect species.&lt;ref&gt;unknown, www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-377894.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sap beetles – family [[Nitidulidae]]

===Mites===

Many [[mite]]s (class [[Acari]], not insects) feed on corpses with ''Macrocheles'' mites common in the early stages of decomposition, while Tyroglyphidae and Oribatidae mites such as Rostrozetes feed on dry skin in the later stages of decomposition.

''[[Nicrophorus]]'' beetles often carry on their bodies the mite ''[[Poecilochirus]]'' which feed on fly eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, González Herrera L, Perotti MA, Jiménez Ríos G | title=Occurrence of ''Poecilochirus austroasiaticus'' (Acari: Parasitidae) in forensic autopsies and its application on postmortem interval estimation | journal=Exp. Appl. Acarol. | year=2013 | volume=59 | issue=3 | pages=297–305 | doi=10.1007/s10493-012-9606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot development is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. ''Nicrophorus'' beetles find the [[ammonia]] excretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the ''Poecilochirus'' mites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow ''Nicrophorus'' to occupy the corpse.

===Moths===

[[Moth]]s (order [[Lepidoptera]]) specifically [[clothes-moth]]s – Family [[Tineidae]] – are closely related to [[butterfly|butterflies]]. Most species of moth are [[nocturnal]], but there are [[crepuscular]] and [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species. Moths feed on mammalian hair during their larval stages and may forage on any hair that remains on a body.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} They are amongst the final animals contributing to the decomposition of a corpse.

===Wasps, ants, and bees===

Wasps, ants, and bees (order [[Hymenoptera]]) are not necessarily necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, and eat the insects feeding on the body. [[Bee]]s and [[wasp]]s have been seen feeding on the body during the early stages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the post mortem interval since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.

==Factors==

===Moisture levels===

Rain and [[humidity]] levels in the area where the body is found can affect the time for insect development. In most species, large amounts of rain will indirectly cause slower development due to drop in temperature. Light rain or a very humid environment, by acting as an insulator, will permit a greater [[core temperature]] within the maggot mass, resulting in faster development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf "Forensic entomology: use of insects to help solve crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119175704/http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}. Uwa.edu.au. 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilet MH, Richards CS, Midgley JM, 2010. Contemporary precision, bias and accuracy of minimum post-mortem intervals estimated using development of carrion-feeding insects. In: Amendt J, Campobasso CP, Goff ML, Grassberger M, eds. Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submerged corpses===
M. Lee Goff, a noted and well respected [[forensic entomologist]], was assigned to a case involving the discovery of a decomposing body found on a boat half a mile from shore. Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, ''Chrysomya megacephala'', was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies will not attempt to trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.

In addition, the amount of time a maggot mass has been exposed to salt water can affect its development. From the cases Goff observed he found that if subjected for more than 30 minutes, there was a 24‑hour developmental delay. Unfortunately, not many more studies have been conducted and thus a specific amount of delay time is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"&gt;Goff, M. L. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun exposure===
"Because insects are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development is more or less dependent on ambient temperature." &lt;ref&gt;Catts, E. P. and N. H. Haskell, eds. ''Entomology &amp; Death: A Procedural Guide''. Joyce's Print Shop, Inc. 1990. p5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bodies exposed to large amounts of sunlight will heat up, giving the insects a warmer area to develop, reducing their development time.
An experiment conducted by Bernard Greenberg and John Charles Kunich with the use of rabbit carcasses to study accumulation of degree days found that with temperature ranging in the mid 70s to high 80s the amount of developmental time for maggots was significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Bernard, and John C. Kunich. Entomology and the Law. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, bodies found in shaded areas will be cooler, and insects will require longer growth periods. In addition, if temperatures reach extreme levels of cold, insects instinctively know to prolong their development time in order to hatch into a more accepting and viable climate in order to increase the chance of survival and reproduction.

===Air exposure===
Hanged bodies can be expected to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies will stay on a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster leaving less food source for the maggots.

As the body begins to decompose, a compilation of fluids will leak to the ground. In this area most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, it is more likely that rove beetles and other non-flying  insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. Fly maggots, initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"/&gt;

===Geography===
According to [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]'s book ''La Faune des Cadavres'' there are eight distinct faunal successions attracted to a corpse. While most [[beetle]]s and [[fly|flies]] of forensic importance can be found worldwide, a portion of them are limited to a specific range of habitats. It is forensically important to know the geographical distribution of these insects is order to determine information such as post mortem interval or whether a body has been moved from its original place of death.

[[Calliphoridae]] is arguably the most important family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse. The family’s habitat ranges into the southern portion of the [[United States]]. However, while ''Chrysomya rufifaces'', the hairy maggot [[Calliphoridae|blow fly]], is part of the family Calliphoridae and is widespread, it is not prevalent in the Southern [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Louisiana]], [[Florida]], or [[Illinois]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whitworth | first1= Terry |title=Keys to Genera and Species of Blow Flies of America North of Mexico |journal = Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington | volume= 108 |issue=3 |year=2006 |page= 710 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30254115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flesh fly|Flesh flies]] fall under the family Sacrophagidae and generally arrive to a corpse following Calliphoridae. However, as previously mentioned they are capable of flying in the rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae overall effecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. Flesh flies are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Thomas. ''Catalog of the Sarcophagidae of the World''. Memoirs on Entomology. Gainesville, FL: Associated, 1996. 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetles are representative of the order [[Coleoptera]] which accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of [[Antarctica]] and high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna can be found in the tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.

===Weather===
Various weather conditions in a given amount of time cause certain pests to invade human households. This is because the insects are in search of food, water, and shelter.
Damp weather causes reproduction and growth enhancement in many insect types, especially when coupled with warm temperatures. Most pests concerned at this time are [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s, [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[ladybug]]s, [[yellowjacket]]s, [[hornet]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[rat]]s.
When conditions are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water. While the rainy weather increases the numbers of insects, this dry weather causes pest invasions to increase. The pests most commonly known during dry conditions are [[scorpion]]s, ants, [[pillbug]]s, [[millipede]]s, crickets, and spiders. Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.
Cold temperatures outside will cause invasions beginning in the late summer months and early fall. [[Box elder bug]]s, [[cluster fly|cluster flies]], ladybugs, and [[silverfish]] are noticed some of the most common insects to seek the warm indoors.&lt;ref name="terminix"&gt;[http://terminix.com/information/weather/ "Pest Control Tips: Pests and Weather"]. ''Terminix.com''. 19 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern techniques==
Many new techniques have been developed &lt;ref&gt;Villet MH, Amendt J, 2011. Advances in entomological methods for estimating time of death. In: Turk EE, ed. Forensic Pathology Reviews. Heidelberg: Humana Press, pp. 213-238&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in order to more accurately [[entomological evidence collection|gather evidence]], or reevaluate old information. The use of these newly developed techniques and evaluations have become relevant in litigation and appeals. Forensic entomology not only uses arthropod biology, but it pulls from other sciences, introducing fields like chemistry and genetics, exploiting their inherent synergy through the [[use of DNA in forensic entomology]].

===Scanning electron microscopy===
Fly larvae and fly eggs are used to aid in the determination of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots.&lt;ref name="pmid18353656"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendonça PM, dos Santos-Mallet JR, de Mello RP, Gomes L, de Carvalho Queiroz MM | title = Identification of fly eggs using scanning electron microscopy for forensic investigations | journal = Micron | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18353656 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2008.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of holes, and the shape and length of the median area.

The SEM method provides an array of morphological features for use in identifying fly eggs; however, this method does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it requires expensive equipment and can take time to identify the species from which the egg originated, so it may not be useful in a field study or to quickly identify a particular egg.&lt;ref name=Sukontason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sukontason|first1=Kom|last2=Sukontason|first2=Kabkaew L|last3=Piangjai|first3=Somsak|last4=Boonchu|first4=Noppawan|last5=Kurahashi|first5=Hiromu|last6=Hope|first6=Michelle|last7=Olson|first7=Jimmy K|title=Identification of forensically important fly eggs using a potassium permanganate staining technique|journal=Micron|volume=35|issue=5|year=2004|pages=391–395|issn=0968-4328|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.12.004|pmid=15006363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SEM method is effective provided there is ample time and the proper equipment and the particular fly eggs are plentiful. The ability to use these morphological differences gives forensic entomologists a powerful tool that can help with estimating a post mortem interval, along with other relevant information, such as whether the body has been disturbed post mortem.

===Potassium permanganate staining===
When scanning electron microscopy is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is [[potassium permanganate]] staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a [[Saline (medicine)|normal saline]] solution and placed in a glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; These slides can be used with any [[Optical microscope|light microscope]] with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.

===Mitochondrial DNA===
In 2001, a method was devised by Jeffrey Wells and Felix Sperling to use [[mitochondrial DNA]] to differentiate between different species of the subfamily Chrysomyinae. This is particularly useful when working to determine the identity of specimens that do not have distinctive morphological characteristics at certain life stages.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. and Sperling Felix A. H. "DNA-based identification of forensically important Chrysomyinae (Diptera: Calliphoridae)"Forensic Science International Volume 120, Issues 1-215 August 2001 110-115 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock crime scenes===
A valuable tool that is becoming very common in the training of forensic entomologists is the use of mock crime scenes using pig carcasses. The pig carcass represents a human body and can be used to illustrate various environmental effects on both arthropod succession and the estimate of the post mortem interval.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenly, Kenneth G. [http://www.nabt.org/sites/S1/index.php?p=2 "Recreating Death's Acre in the School Yard: Using Pig Carcasses as Model"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} American Biology Teacher v68 n7 September 2006 402-410 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene expression studies===
Although physical characteristics and sizes at various [[instars]] have been used to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=Tarone&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarone |first=Aaron M.  |authorlink= |author2=Jennings, Kimberley C.|author3=Foran, David R.  |date=November 2007 |title=Aging Blow Fly Eggs Using Gene Expression: A Feasibility Study |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1350–1354 |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x  |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x |accessdate= 1 April 2008 |pmid=18093065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three genes were measured in an experiment with ''Drosophila melanogaster'': bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because they are likely to be in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high [[Confidence interval|confidence level]].&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.

==Insect activity case study==
A preliminary investigation of insect colonization and succession on remains in [[New Zealand]] revealed the following results on decay and insect colonization.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eberhardt TL, Elliot DA | title=A preliminary investigation of insect colonisation and succession on remains in New Zealand | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2008 | volume=176 | issue=2–3 | pages=217–223 | pmid=17997065 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open field habitat===
This environment had a daily average maximum temperature of {{convert|19.4|C|F}} and a daily minimum temperature of {{convert|11.1|C|F}}. The average rainfall for the first 3 weeks in this environment was 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm/day. Around days 17–45, the body began to start active decay. During this stage, the insect successions started with ''[[Calliphora]] stygia'', which lasted until day 27. The larvae of ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'' were present between the day 13 and day 47. The ''H. rostrata'', larvae of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'', [[Psychodidae]] family, and sylvicola were found to occur relatively late in the body's decay.

===Coastal sand-dune habitat===
This environment had an average daily maximum temperature of {{convert|21.4|C|F}} and minimum of {{convert|13.5|C|F}}. The daily average rainfall was recorded as 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day for the first 3 weeks. The post-decay time interval, beginning at day six after death and ending around day 15 after death, is greatly reduced from the average post-decay time, due to the high average temperature of this environment. Insects obtained late in the post-active stage include the ''Calliphora quadrimaculata'', adult Sphaeroceridae, [[Psychodidae]] and [[Piophilidae]] (no larvae from this last family were obtained in recovery).

===Native bush habitat===
This environment had recorded daily average maximum and minimum temperatures were {{convert|18.0|C|F}} and {{convert|13.0|C|F}}, respectively. The average rainfall in this habitat was recorded at 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day. After the bloat stage, which lasted until day seven after death, post-active decay began around day 14. In this habitat, the ''H. rostrata'', adult [[Phoridae]], Sylvicola larvae and adult were the predominant species remaining on the body during the pre-[[skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonization]] stages.

==In literature==
Throughout its history the study of forensic entomology has not remained an esoteric science reserved only for entomologists and forensic scientists.
Early twentieth-century popular scientific literature began to pique a broader interest in [[entomology]]. The very popular ten-volume book series, Alfred Brehem’s ''Thierleben'' (Life of Animals, 1876–1879) expounded on many [[zoological]] topics, including [[arthropods]]. The accessible writing style of French entomologist [[Jean-Henri Fabre]] was also instrumental in the popularization of entomology. His collection of writings ''Souvenirs Entomologique'', written during the last half of the 19th century, is especially useful because of the meticulous attention to detail to the observed insects’ behaviors and life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The real impetus behind the modern cultural fascination with solving crime using entomological evidence can be traced back to the works ''Faune des Tombeaux'' (Fauna of the Tombs, 1887) and ''Les Faunes des Cadavres'' (Fauna of Corpses, 1894) by French [[veterinarian]] and [[entomologist]] [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]. These works made the concept of the process of insect ecological succession on a corpse understandable and interesting to an ordinary reader in a way that no other previous scientific work had done. It was after the publication of Mégnin’s work that the studies of forensic science and entomology became an established part of Western popular culture, which in turn inspired other scientists to continue and expand upon his research.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girih tiles3.svg|thumb|right|200px|Construction lines are usually hidden: geometric tiles on left, girih pattern on right.]]
'''Girih tiles''' are a set of five [[tile]]s that were used in the creation of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] using [[strapwork]] ([[girih]]) for decoration of buildings in [[Islamic architecture]]. They have been used since about the year 1200 and their arrangements found significant improvement starting with the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] built in 1453.

==Five tiles==

The five shapes of the tiles are:
* a regular [[decagon]] with ten interior angles of 144°;
* an elongated (irregular convex) [[hexagon]] with interior angles of 72°, 144°, 144°, 72°, 144°, 144°;
* a [[bow tie]] (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 72°, 72°, 216°, 72°, 72°, 216°;
* a [[rhombus]] with interior angles of 72°, 108°, 72°, 108°; and
* a regular [[pentagon]] with five interior angles of 108°.

These modules have their own specific Persian names:  The quadrilateral tile is called Torange,  the pentagonal tile is called Pange, the concave octagonal tile is called Shesh Band , the bow tie tile is called Sormeh Dan, decagram tile is called Tabl. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarhangi|first=Reza|date=|title=Interlocking Star Polygons in Persian Architecture: The Special Case of the Decagram in Mosaic Designs|url=|journal=Nexus Netw J|volume=14|pages=350|via=JSTORE}}&lt;/ref&gt;All sides of these figures have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s). All of them, except the pentagon, have bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold [[rotational symmetry]] (rotation by 36°); and the pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°). 

== The Emergence of Girih Tiles ==
By the late 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic artists in North Africa start to use “tile mosaic”, which is the predecessor of tessellation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam : art and architecture|last=Hattstein /Delius.|first=Markus/Peter|publisher=Potsdam : H.F. Ullmann|year=2013|isbn=3848003805|location=|pages=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; . By 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic discovered a new way to construct the “tile mosaic” due to the development of arithmetic calculation and geometry—the girih tiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu/Steinhardt|first=Peter/Paul|date=2007|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture|url=|journal=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20039057|volume=315|pages=2|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Girih==

[[Girih]] are lines ([[strapwork]]) that decorate the tiles. The tiles are used to form girih patterns, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, meaning "knot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sebastian R. Prange |date=September–October 2009 | title = The Tiles of Infinity | journal = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 24–31 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200905/the.tiles.of.infinity.htm
}}{{deadlink|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than the boundaries of the tiles themselves. The girih are piece-wise straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.

== Mathematics of girih tilings ==


In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] suggested that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s, predating them by five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peter J. Lu and Paul J. Steinhardt | year = 2007 | title = Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 315 | pages = 1106–1110 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1106.full | doi = 10.1126/science.1135491
 | pmid = 17322056 | issue = 5815 | bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf Supplemental figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326095515/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding was supported both by analysis of patterns on surviving structures, and by examination of 15th-century Persian scrolls. However, we have no indication of how much more the architects may have known about the mathematics involved. It is generally believed that such designs were constructed by drafting zigzag outlines with only a straightedge and a compass. Templates found on scrolls such as the 97-foot- (29.5 metres) long [[Topkapi Scroll]] may have been consulted. Found in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire and believed to date from the late 15th century, the scroll shows a succession of two- and three- dimensional geometric patterns. There is no text, but there is a grid pattern and color-coding used to highlight symmetries and distinguish three-dimensional projections. Drawings such as shown on this scroll would have served as pattern-books for the artisans who fabricated the tiles, and the shapes of the girih tiles dictated how they could be combined into large patterns. In this way, craftsmen could make highly complex designs without resorting to mathematics and without necessarily understanding their underlying principles.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gulru Necipoglu  | year = 1995 | title = The Topkapi Scroll:  Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture | publisher = Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of repeating patterns created from a limited number of geometric shapes available to craftsmen of the day is similar to the practice of contemporary European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artisans. Designers of both styles were concerned with using their inventories of geometrical shapes to create the maximum diversity of forms. This demanded a skill and practice very different from mathematics.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"/&gt;

=== Geometric construction of an interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design ===
Firstly, divide the right angle A into five parts with same degree by creating four rays that start from A. Find an arbitrary point C on the second ray and drop perpendiculars from C to the sides of angle A counter-clockwise. This step creates the rectangle ABCD along with four segments that each has an endpoint at A and other endpoints are the intersections of the four rays with the two sides of BC and DC of rectangle ABCD. Then, find the midpoint of the fourth segment created from the fourth ray point E. Construct an arc with center A and radius AE to intersect AB at point F and the second ray at point G. The second segment is now a part of the rectangle’s diagonal. Make a line, parallel to AD and passing through point G, that intersects the first ray at point H and the third ray at point I. The line HF passes through point E and intersects the third ray at L and line AD at J. Construct a line, passing through J which is parallel to the third ray. Also construct line EI and find M which is the intersection of this line with AD. From the point F make a parallel line to the third ray to meet the first ray at K. Construct segments GK, GL, and EM. Find the point N such that GI = IN by constructing a circle with center I and radius IG. Construct the line DN which is parallel to GK, to intersect the line emanate from J, to find P to complete the regular pentagon EINPJ. Line DN meets the perpendicular bisector of AB at Q. From Q construct a line parallel to FK to intersect ray MI at R. As shown in the figure, using O which is the center of the rectangle ABCD, as a center of rotation for 180°, one can make the fundamental region for the tiling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:WX20181125-203644@2x.png|thumb|An interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design]]

=== Geometric construction of A tessellation from Mirza Akbar architectural scrolls ===
First, divide the right angle into five congruent angles, a arbitrary point P was selected on the first ray counterclockwise. For the radius of the circle inscribed in the decagram one half of the segment created from the third ray, segment AM, was selected. The following figure illustrates a step-by-step compass-straightedge visual solution to the problem by the author.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Note that the way to divide a right angle into five congruent angles is not a part of the instructions provided, because it is considered an elementary step for designers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. To begin with, the patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture. “The specific types of embellishments utilized in orosi typically linked the windows to the patron’s social and political eminence.”The more ornate a window is, the higher social and economic status the owner is more likely to have. A good example for this would be Azad Koliji. The Azad Koliji is a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects successfully demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer would be the actual garden which people can have a glimpse at when they open the window. In addition to this natural layer, the first girih pattern on the outside of the window (the carved pattern. Another artificial layer would be the colorful glasses on the window. The multi-color layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. This layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window, and gives the audience enough space to imagine.

A '''hardstand''' is a paved area for parking heavy vehicles.

== Uses ==
Hardstand are found at [[airport]]s, [[military building|military facilities]], [[freight terminal]]s, and other facilities where heavy vehicles need to be parked for significant periods of time.

== Purpose ==
Heavy vehicles can sometimes be parked on areas of unpaved compacted earth for short periods of time.  But if left parked in these areas for extended periods of time, heavy vehicles can sink into the soil and become mired.

== Construction ==
[[File:Enola Gay (plane).jpg|thumb|''[[Enola Gay]]'' maneuvers into position at a hardstand upon returning to base following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].]]
Hardstands are paved with materials including [[Pavement (architecture) | concrete heavy duty pavers]] which give a lot of maintenance flexibility over other products as well as strength for the life of the project or [[asphalt]]/[[macadam]].  The paving is usually designed to be thicker and more durable than drives, city [[street]]s, or automobile [[parking lot]]s in order to support the weight of heavy vehicles such as large [[airplane]]s, [[tank]]s, or heavy [[truck]]s.

The '''history of penicillin''' follows a number of observations and discoveries of apparent evidence of antibiotic activity in [[mold]]s before the modern isolation of the chemical [[penicillin]] in 1928. There are anecdotes about ancient societies using molds to treat infections, and in the following centuries many people observed the inhibition of bacterial growth by various molds.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Fleming |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/alexander-fleming |website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 August 2018|date=June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unknown if the species involved were ''[[Penicillium]]'' species or if the antimicrobial substances produced were penicillin.

The Scottish physician [[Alexander Fleming]] was the first to suggest that a ''[[Penicillium]]'' mold must secrete an antibacterial substance, and the first to concentrate the active substance involved, which he named [[penicillin]], in 1928. Penicillin was the first modern [[antibiotic]]. During the next twelve years Fleming grew, distributed, and studied the original mold, which was determined to be a rare variant of ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' (now ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'').&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macfarlane"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Gwyn |title=Alexander Fleming, the man and the myth |date=1984 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many later scientists were involved in the stabilization and mass production of penicillin and in the search for more productive strains of ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name="Barreiro"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreiro |first1=Carlos |last2=Martín |first2=Juan F. |last3=García-Estrada |first3=Carlos |title=Proteomics Shows New Faces for the Old Penicillin Producer |journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology |date=2012 |volume=2012 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1155/2012/105109 |pmid=22318718 |pmc=3270403 |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/105109/ |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important contributors include [[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]], [[Norman Heatley]], and [[Edward Abraham]].&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery and Development of Penicillin |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = International Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate = August 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the discovery of penicillin, scientists found that some disease-causing pathogens display antibiotic resistance to penicillin. Research that aims to develop more effective strains and to study the causes and mechanisms of [[antibiotic resistance]] continues today.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobanovska"/&gt;

==Early history==

Many ancient cultures, including those in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[History of India|India]], independently discovered the useful properties of fungi and plants in treating [[infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/history-of-antibiotics.html |title=History of Antibiotics &amp;#124; Steps of the Scientific Method, Research and Experiments |publisher=Experiment-Resources.com |accessdate=2012-07-13}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt; These treatments often worked because many organisms, including many species of [[mold]], naturally produce [[antibiotic]] substances. However, ancient practitioners could not precisely identify or isolate the active components in these organisms.

In [[Sri Lanka]] in the second century BC, soldiers in the army of king [[Dutugemunu]] (161–137 BC) are recorded to have stored oil cakes (a traditional Sri Lankan sweetmeat) for long periods in their hearth lofts before embarking on military campaigns in order to make a [[poultice]] of the cakes to treat wounds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} 

In 17th-century [[Poland]], wet bread was mixed with spider webs (which often contained fungal [[spore]]s) to treat wounds. The technique was mentioned by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] in his 1884 book ''[[With Fire and Sword]]''. In [[England]] in 1640, the idea of using mold as a form of medical treatment was recorded by apothecaries such as John Parkinson, King's Herbarian, who advocated the use of mold in his book on [[pharmacology]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Early scientific evidence==

The modern history of penicillin research begins in earnest in the 1870s, in the United Kingdom. [[John Scott Burdon-Sanderson|Sir John Scott Burdon-Sanderson]], who started out at St. Mary's Hospital (1852–1858) and later worked there as a lecturer (1854–1862), observed that [[microbiological culture|culture]] fluid covered with mold would produce no [[bacteria]]l growth. Burdon-Sanderson's discovery prompted [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], an English surgeon and the father of modern [[antisepsis]], to discover in 1871 that urine samples contaminated with mold also did not permit the growth of bacteria. Lister also described the antibacterial action on human tissue of a species of mold he called ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFarlane|first1=Gwyn|title=Howard Florey : the making of a great scientist|date=1979|publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198581611|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nurse at [[King's College Hospital]] whose wounds did not respond to any traditional antiseptic was then given another substance that cured her, and Lister's registrar informed her that it was called Penicillium. In 1874, the Welsh physician [[William Roberts (physician)|William Roberts]], who later coined the term "[[enzyme]]", observed that bacterial contamination is generally absent in laboratory cultures of ''Penicillium glaucum''. [[John Tyndall]] followed up on Burdon-Sanderson's work and demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1875 the antibacterial action of the ''Penicillium'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/ships/updates/fleming.htm |publisher=SHiPS Resource Center |title=Penicillin &amp; Chance |author=Douglas Allchin |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528100504/http://www1.umn.edu/ships/updates/fleming.htm |archivedate=28 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' had been shown to cause [[anthrax]], the first demonstration that a specific bacterium caused a specific disease.

In 1877, French biologists [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Jules Francois Joubert]] observed that cultures of the anthrax bacilli, when contaminated with molds, could be successfully inhibited. Some references say that Pasteur identified the strain as ''[[Penicillium notatum]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} However, [[Paul de Kruif]]'s 1926 ''Microbe Hunters'' describes this incident as contamination by other bacteria rather than by mold.&lt;ref&gt;'At once Pasteur jumped to a fine idea: “If the harmless bugs from the air choke out the anthrax bacilli in the bottle, they will do it in the body too! It is a kind of dog-eat-dog!” shouted Pasteur, (...) Pasteur gravely announced: “That there were high hopes for the cure of disease from this experiment,” but that is the last you hear of it, for Pasteur was never a man to give the world of science the benefit of studying his failures.'&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, Garré found similar results. In 1895, [[Vincenzo Tiberio]], an Italian physician at the [[University of Naples]], published research about a mold in a water well in [[Arzano]] that showed antibacterial action.&lt;ref&gt;Tiberio, Vincenzo (1895) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LNg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sugli estratti di alcune muffe"] [On the extracts of certain moulds], ''Annali d'Igiene Sperimentale'' (Annals of Experimental Hygiene), 2nd series, '''5''' : 91–103.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LNg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From p. 95:]  ''"Risulta chiaro da queste osservazioni che nella sostanza cellulare delle muffe esaminate son contenuti dei principi solubili in acqua, forniti di azione battericida:  sotto questo riguardo sono più attivi o in maggior copia quelli dell' ''Asp. flavescens'', meno quelli del ''Mu. mucedo'' e del ''Penn. glaucum''."''  (It follows clearly from these observations that in the cellular substance of the moulds examined are contained some water-soluble substances, provided with bactericidal action:  in this respect are more active or in greater abundance those of ''Aspergillus flavescens''; less, those of ''Mucor mucedo'' and ''Penicillium glaucum''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bucci R., Galli P.

Two years later, [[Ernest Duchesne]] at École du Service de Santé Militaire in [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] independently discovered the healing properties of a ''Penicillium glaucum'' mold, even curing infected [[guinea pig]]s of [[typhoid]]. He published a dissertation&lt;ref name="Duchesne 1897"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between moulds and bacteria.  An English translation by Michael Witty.  Fort Myers, 2013.  ASIN B00E0KRZ0E and B00DZVXPIK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Duchesne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes : antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes''] [Contribution to the study of the vital competition in microorganisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes], (Lyon, France:  Alexandre Rey, 1897).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx2002x036x001/HSMx2002x036x001x0011.pdf Une découverte oubliée : la thèse de médecine du docteur Ernest Duchesne (1874–1912)]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1897 but it was ignored by the [[Institut Pasteur]]. Duchesne was himself using a discovery made earlier by Arab stable boys, who used molds to cure sores on horses. He did not claim that the mold contained any antibacterial substance, only that the mold somehow protected the animals. The penicillin isolated by Fleming does not cure typhoid and so it remains unknown which substance might have responsible for Duchesne's cure.{{efn|At the time, the term ''Penicillium glaucum'' was used as a catch-all phrase for a variety of different fungi, though not for ''Penicillium notatum''. Duchesne's specific mold was unfortunately not preserved, which makes it impossible to be certain today which fungus might have been responsible for the cure and, consequently, even less certain which specific antibacterial substance was responsible.}}

In [[Belgium]] in 1920, Andre Gratia and Sara Dath observed a fungal contamination in one of their ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' cultures that was inhibiting the growth of the bacterium. They identified the fungus as a species of ''Penicillium'' and presented their observations as a paper, but it received little attention. An [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] scientist, [[Costa Rica]]n [[Clodomiro Picado Twight]], similarly recorded the antibiotic effect of ''Penicillium'' in 1923.

==Modern breakthroughs==

===First isolation and successful treatment===

In 1928, Scottish biologist [[Alexander Fleming]] noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mold on a ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' plate culture. He concluded that the mold was releasing a substance that was inhibiting bacterial growth. He grew a pure culture of the mold and subsequently concentrated what he later named "[[penicillin]]". During the next twelve years, Fleming grew and distributed the original mold, which was eventually identified as ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' (now known as ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]''). He was unsuccessful in making a stable form of it for mass production.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowden |first1=Mary Ellen  |title=Old Brew, New Brew  |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/old-brew-new-brew |journal=Distillations |date=2018|volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=8–11 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cecil George Paine]], a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in [[Sheffield]], attempted to treat [[sycosis]] (eruptions in beard follicles) with penicillin but was unsuccessful, probably because the drug did not penetrate deep enough. Moving on to [[ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in babies, he achieved the first cure on 25 November 1930. He cured four patients (one adult, the others infants) of eye infections, although a fifth patient was not so lucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wainwright M, Swan HT |title=C.G.

===Stabilization and mass production===

At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Howard Walter Florey]] organized a large and very skilled biochemical research team, notable among them [[Ernst Boris Chain]] and [[Norman Heatley]], to undertake clinical trials and produce a stable penicillin in quantity. In 1940, Chain and [[Edward Abraham]] reported the first indication of [[antibiotic resistance]] to penicillin, an ''[[E. coli]]'' strain that produced the [[penicillinase]] enzyme, which was capable of breaking down penicillin and completely negating its antibacterial effect.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobanovska"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobanovska |first1=M |last2=Pilla |first2=G |title=Penicillin's Discovery and Antibiotic Resistance: Lessons for the Future? |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |date=March 2017 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=135–145 |pmid=28356901 |pmc=5369031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=EP |last2=Chain |first2=E |title=An enzyme from bacteria able to destroy penicillin. |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |date=1940 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=677–8 |pmid=3055168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1941 and 1943, Moyer, Coghill and Raper at the [[USDA]] [[National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research|Northern Regional Research Laboratory]] (NRRL) in [[Peoria, Illinois]], [[United States]], developed methods for industrialized penicillin production and isolated higher-yielding strains of the ''Penicillium'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2003.html |title=''Penicillium chrysogenum'' (aka ''P. notatum''), the natural source for the wonder drug penicillin, the first antibiotic |work=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicpeoria.com/entry.php?eid=144&amp;catid=1&amp;cid=1 |title=Historic Peoria, Illinois |publisher=Northern Regional Research Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, survivors of the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] in [[Boston]] were the first burn patients to be successfully treated with penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart B.

Kane]] and other [[Pfizer]] scientists in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] developed the practical, deep-tank [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] method for production of large quantities of pharmaceutical-grade penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1900_1950.jsp|title=1900–1950|year=2009|work=Exploring Our History|publisher=Pfizer Inc|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorothy Hodgkin]] determined the correct chemical structure of penicillin using [[X-ray crystallography]] at Oxford in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penicillin X-ray data showed that proposed β-lactam structure was right |url=http://cen.xraycrystals.org/penicillin.html |website=C&amp;EN |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HODGKIN"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=HODGKIN |first1=D.

'''Installation art''' is an artistic genre of [[three-dimensional]] works that often are [[site-specific art|site-specific]] and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called [[public art]], [[land art]] or [[intervention art]]; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.

==History==
[[File:Art exhibit at ALMA.jpg|thumb|A golf ball of enormous proportions alongside the antennas at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Apparition at ALMA|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15048/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Installation art can be either temporary or permanent. Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their "evocative" qualities, as well as [[new media]] such as [[video]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[immersive virtual reality]] and the [[internet]]. Many installations are [[Site-Specific Art|site-specific]] in that they are designed to exist only in the space for which they were created, appealing to qualities evident in a three-dimensional immersive medium. Artistic collectives such as the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab|Exhibition Lab]] at New York's [[American Museum of Natural History]] created environments to showcase the natural world in as realistic a medium as possible. Likewise, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] employed a similar philosophy when designing the multiple immersive spaces for [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Since its acceptance as a separate discipline, a number of institutions focusing on Installation art were created. These included the [[Mattress Factory]], Pittsburgh, the Museum of Installation in London, and the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI]], among others.

Installation art came to prominence in the 1970s but its roots can be identified in earlier artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and his use of the [[readymade]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Merz'' art objects, rather than more traditional [[craft]] based [[sculpture]]. The "intention" of the artist is paramount in much later installation art whose roots lie in the [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s. This again is a departure from traditional sculpture which places its focus on [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]]. Early non-Western installation art includes events staged by the [[Gutai group]] in Japan starting in 1954, which influenced American installation pioneers like [[Allan Kaprow]].
[[Wolf Vostell]] shows his installation ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/ Wolf Vostell, ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.

==Installation==
[[File:Petzel shapes.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Allan McCollum]].''The Shapes Project'', 2005/06]]
''Installation'' as nomenclature for a specific form of art came into use fairly recently; its first use as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1969. It was coined in this context, in reference to a form of art that had arguably existed since prehistory but was not regarded as a discrete category until the mid-twentieth century. [[Allan Kaprow]] used the term "Environment" in 1958 (Kaprow 6) to describe his transformed indoor spaces; this later joined such terms as "project art" and "temporary art."

Essentially, installation/environmental art takes into account a broader sensory experience, rather than floating framed points of focus on a "neutral" wall or displaying isolated objects (literally) on a pedestal. This may leave [[space]] and [[time]] as its only dimensional constants, implying dissolution of the line between "art" and "life"; Kaprow noted that "if we bypass 'art' and take nature itself as a model or point of departure, we may be able to devise a different kind of art... out of the sensory stuff of ordinary life".

==Gesamtkunstwerk==
The conscious act of artistically addressing all the senses with regard to a total experience made a resounding debut in 1849 when [[Richard Wagner]] conceived of a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', or an operatic work for the stage that drew inspiration from ancient [[Greek theater]] in its inclusion of all the major art forms: [[painting]], [[writing]], [[music]], etc. (Britannica). In devising operatic works to commandeer the audience's senses, Wagner left nothing unobserved: [[architecture]], ambience, and even the [[audience]] itself were considered and manipulated in order to achieve a state of total artistic immersion. In the book "Themes in Contemporary Art", it is suggested that "installations in the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly characterized by networks of operations involving the interaction among complex architectural settings, environmental sites and extensive use of everyday objects in ordinary contexts. With the advent of video in 1965, a concurrent strand of installation evolved through the use of new and ever-changing technologies, and what had been simple video installations expanded to include complex interactive, multimedia and virtual reality environments".

==Art and Objecthood==
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|''Guardians of Time'', [[Manfred Kielnhofer]], [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)]] French Cathedral, Berlin, Velotaxi 2011]]
In "Art and Objecthood", [[Michael Fried]] derisively labels art that acknowledges the viewer as "theatrical" (Fried 45). There is a strong parallel between installation and theater: both play to a viewer who is expected to be at once immersed in the [[perception|sensory]]/[[narrative]] experience that surrounds him and maintain a degree of self-identity as a viewer. The traditional theater-goer does not forget that he has come in from outside to sit and take in a created experience; a trademark of installation art has been the curious and eager viewer, still aware that he is in an exhibition setting and tentatively exploring the novel universe of the installation.

The artist and critic [[Ilya Kabakov]] mentions this essential phenomenon in the introduction to his lectures "On the "Total" Installation": "[One] is simultaneously both a 'victim' and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him[;] he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total illusion". Here installation art bestows an unprecedented importance on the observer's inclusion in that which he observes. The expectations and social habits that the viewer takes with him into the space of the installation will remain with him as he enters, to be either applied or negated once he has taken in the new environment. What is common to nearly all installation art is a consideration of the experience in toto and the problems it may present, namely the constant conflict between disinterested criticism and sympathetic involvement. [[Television]] and [[video]] offer somewhat immersive experiences, but their unrelenting control over the [[rhythm]] of passing time and the arrangement of images precludes an intimately personal viewing experience. Ultimately, the only things a viewer can be assured of when experiencing the work are his own thoughts and preconceptions and the basic rules of space and time. All else may be molded by the artist's hands.

The central importance of the [[Subjective experience|subjective]] point of view when experiencing installation art, points toward a disregard for traditional [[Platonism|Platonic]] image theory. In effect, the entire installation adopts the character of the [[simulacrum]] or flawed [[statue]]: it neglects any ideal form in favor of optimizing its direct appearance to the observer. Installation art operates fully within the realm of sensory perception, in a sense "installing" the viewer into an artificial system with an appeal to his subjective perception as its ultimate goal.

==Interactive installations==

[[Image:Maurizio bolognini genoa.JPG|210px|thumb|An urban interactive art installation by [[Maurizio Bolognini]] (Genoa, 2005), which everybody can modify by using a cell phone.]]
An [[Interactive Art|interactive installation]] frequently involves the audience acting on the work of art or the piece responding to users' activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Younis|first1=Lauren|title=Hearts and Scissors Exhibit to Open|url=http://bl-ids-website.ads.iu.edu/news/story.aspx?id=66728|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=March 5, 2009|quote="Installation art can facilitate a direct, immediate interaction with the viewer," [Cindy] Hinant said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several kinds of interactive installations that artists produce, these include [[Internet art|web]]-based installations (e.g., [[Telegarden]]), [[Art gallery|gallery]]-based installations, [[Digital art|digital]]-based installations, [[Electronics|electronic]]-based installations, [[IPhone art|mobile]]-based installations, etc. Interactive installations appeared mostly at end of the 1980s (''Legible City'' by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], ''La plume'' by [[Edmond Couchot]], Michel Bret...)  and became a genre during the 1990s, when artists became particularly interested in using the participation of the audiences to activate and reveal the meaning of the installation.

==Immersive virtual reality==

With the improvement of [[technology]] over the years, artists are more able to explore outside of the boundaries that were never able to be explored by artists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media (arts)|media]] used are more experimental and bold; they are also usually cross media and may involve sensors, which plays on the reaction to the audiences' movement when looking at the installations. By using virtual reality as a medium, [[immersive virtual reality]] art is probably the most deeply interactive form of art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing the spectator to "visit" the representation, the artist creates "situations to live" vs "spectacle to watch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Benayoun]], ''Maurice Benayoun Open Art'', Nouvelles éditions Scala, 2011, French version, {{ISBN|978-2-35988-046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion''''' (''JSSR'') is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] in the [[United States of America]] under the auspices of the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], dedicated to publishing scholarly articles in the social sciences, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], devoted to the study of religion. It is not a [[theology]] journal, as its publications tend to be [[Empirical research|empirical papers]] in the aforementioned disciplines, rather than papers assessing the truth or falsity, or otherwise attempting to clarify, theological doctrines. However, the eminent theologian [[Paul Tillich]] wrote a preface to the first edition, published in 1961. A former editor, [[Ralph W. Hood]], is a major name in the [[psychology of religion]], having published scales to assess [[religious experience]] and [[mystical experience]]. Hood was succeeded as editor in 1999 by Ted Jelen, the first ever [[political scientist]] to edit the journal. Jelen was later succeeded as editor by sociologist [[Rhys H. Williams (sociologist)|Rhys Williams]]. The current editor of the journal is [[Laura Olson]] ([[Clemson University]]).

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2011 [[impact factor]] of 1.348, ranking it 30th out of 138 journals in the category "Sociology".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Sociology |title=2011 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=Web of Science |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">A '''K-line''', or '''Knowledge-line''', is a [[mental agent]] which represents an association of a group of other mental agents found active when a subject solves a certain [[problem]] or formulates a new [[idea]]. These were first described in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s essay [[K-lines: A Theory of Memory]], published in 1980 in the journal ''Cognitive Science'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you "get an idea," or "solve a problem" ... you create what we shall call a K-line. ... When that K-line is later "activated", it reactivates ... mental agencies, creating a partial mental state "resembling the original."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/CSJarchive/1980v04/i02/p0117p0133/MAIN.PDF  Minsky's "K-lines: A Theory of Memory]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Whenever you 'get a good idea', solve a problem, or have a memorable experience, you activate a K-line to 'represent' it. A K-line is a wirelike structure that attaches itself to whichever mental agents are active when you solve a problem or have a good idea.

When you activate that K-line later, the agents attached to it are aroused, putting you into a 'mental state' much like the one you were in when you solved that problem or got that idea.  This should make it relatively easy for you to solve new, similar problems!" (1998, p. 82.)

'''Mannerism''', also known as '''Late Renaissance''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT330&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mannerism%20late%20renaissance&amp;f=false A World history of architecture] and [https://books.google.it/books?id=nHzqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEIJDAA Mannerism: the painting and style of the Late Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; is a style in [[European art]] that emerged in the later years of the Italian [[High Renaissance]] around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the [[Baroque]] style largely replaced it. [[Northern Mannerism]] continued into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1971, 483.&lt;!--If this statement can be found in the third edition of 1993, it would be preferable to cite from that edition, which is cited elsewhere in this same article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting style|Stylistically]], Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], and early [[Michelangelo]]. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich 1995, {{Page needed|date=April 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]]—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the [[Classical Latin|Silver Age of Latin literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation|title=the-mannerist-style |publisher=www.artsconnected.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|230px|Mannerism role-model: ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', an ancient sculpture, rediscovered in 1506; now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The artists of Mannerism greatly admired this piece of sculpture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;]]

The word ''mannerism'' derives from the Italian ''maniera'', meaning "style" or "manner". Like the English word "style", ''maniera'' can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone "has style").&lt;ref&gt;
John Shearman, “Maniera as an Aesthetic Ideal”, in Cheney 2004, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), [[Giorgio Vasari]] used ''maniera'' in three different contexts:  to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term ''maniera greca'' to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the ''maniera'' of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney 1997, 17.&lt;!--The pagination may be different in the 1997 edition from the 2004 one found as the main entry in the reference list. Be sure the right one is being cited. Ideally, only one edition should be cited unless there is information in the earlier missing in the later edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as "la maniera moderna", or the "modern style".&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; James V. Mirollo describes how "bella maniera" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mirollo 1984, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "bella maniera" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, "bella maniera" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As a stylistic label, "Mannerism" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and popularized by German [[Art history|art historians]] in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by [[John Shearman]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by [[Fritz Grossmann]] at [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester City Art Gallery]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.
However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, "la maniera" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth 1962, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|thumb|230px|Collected figures, ignudi, from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling]]

By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} At this point Mannerism started to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence,&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.&lt;ref name="freedberg175"&gt;Freedberg 1993, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and role models===
This period has been described as a "natural extension"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the art of [[Andrea del Sarto]], Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his ''terribilità'', a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called ''[[ignudi]]'' and of the [[Libyan Sibyl]], his [[vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] to the [[Laurentian Library]], the figures on his [[Medici]] tombs, and above all his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]''. The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'', Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: "Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====The competitive spirit====

The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere [[Piero Soderini]] to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.

===Early mannerism===
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 004.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacopo Pontormo]], ''Entombment'', 1528; Santa Felicità, Florence]]
The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of [[Andrea del Sarto]] such as [[Jacopo da Pontormo]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]] who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. [[Parmigianino]] (a student of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]) and [[Giulio Romano]] (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome.  These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as "anti-classical”,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its "anti-classical" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.&lt;ref name="freedberg175" /&gt; Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book ''After Raphael'' that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]], the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Manfred Wundram, "Mannerism," Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 23 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} from the earlier, so-called "anti-classical" phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected "manner" (''maniera''). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between "unseen, but felt, quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called "stylish style" or ''Maniera'' in its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;
Shearman 1967, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of mannerism==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey 1546.jpg|thumb|230px|English Mannerism: [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], 1546, a rare English Mannerist portrait by a Flemish immigrant]]

The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by [[Titian]] in his long career.  A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the first international artistic style since the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Francis I of France]], for example, was presented with [[Bronzino]]'s ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]''. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] brothers, [[Caravaggio]] and [[Cigoli]], revived naturalism. [[Walter Friedlaender]] identified this period as "anti-mannerism", just as the early mannerists were "anti-classical" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1957, {{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at [[School of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], it is known as the "[[Henry II style]]" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of [[Northern Mannerism]] include the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], as well as [[Haarlem]] and [[Antwerp]]. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to [[England|English]] visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as "[[Elizabethan]]" and "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson 1983, 157–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the "pittore vago," a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues.  Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194–202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgio Vasari===
[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'': he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (''invenzione''), expressed through virtuoso technique (''maniera''), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's [[Medici]] patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' would be called "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural "architectural" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His ''Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura'' (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of [[decorum]], which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical ''Idea del tempio della pittura'' (''The ideal temple of painting'', Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the "four temperaments" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

==Some Mannerist artists==

The Dragon seems of sino-oriental influence.]]

===Jacopo da Pontormo===
[[Pontormo|Jacopo da Pontormo]]'s ''Joseph in Egypt'' features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
[[Rosso Fiorentino]], who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of [[Andrea del Sarto]], in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to [[Fontainebleau]], where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the "[[School of Fontainebleau]]".

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of [[engraving]]s, to [[Antwerp]] and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and [[allegory]], and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===
Mannerist portraits by [[Bronzino|Agnolo Bronzino]] are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.

===Alessandro Allori===
[[Alessandro Allori]]'s (1535–1607) ''Susanna and the Elders'' (''below'') is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Tintoretto===
[[Tintoretto]]'s ''Last Supper'' (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life.  Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the [[angel]]s looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist."

===El Greco===
[[El Greco]] attempted to express [[religious]] emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring "acid" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg29/gg29-over1.html |title=National Gallery of Art – El Greco |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (1541–1614) |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benvenuto Cellini===

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] created the [[Cellini Salt Cellar]] of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]] (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.

===Joachim Wtewael===
[[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working.  His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of [[Pieter Aertsen]], and mythological scenes, many small [[cabinet painting]]s beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (also spelled ''Arcimboldi'') is known for his portraits contrived from a [[still life]] composition

==Mannerist architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-mannerism/ |title=Style Guide: Mannerism  |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria and Albert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Art|last=Wundram|first=Manfred|publisher=Grove|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the [[Laurentian Library]], was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vSfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=michelangelo+pioneered+mannerist+style#v=onepage&amp;q=michelangelo%20pioneered%20mannerist%20style&amp;f=false|page=Foreward|nopp=true|title=Michelangelo: 240 Colour Plates|isbn=9788892577916|last1=Peitcheva|first1=Maria|date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence.&lt;ref name=venturi/&gt; Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author [[Robert Venturi]] wrote "Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously." &lt;ref name=venturi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designtheory.fiu.edu/readings/venturi_architecture_as_signs.pdf |title=Architecture as Signs and Systems |last1=Venturi |first1=Robert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281–85&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in [[Valletta]], the new capital city of [[Malta]], were designed by the architect [[Girolamo Cassar]] in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Valletta|auberges]]. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the [[Baroque]] period. However, a few buildings, such as [[Auberge d'Aragon]] and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul |first1=Michael |title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca |journal=Melita Historica |date=2004 |volume=XIV |issue=1 |page=37 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf |issn=1021-6952 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14%282004-07%29/MH.14%282004%291/02.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerism in literature and music==

{{See also|Metaphysical poets}}
In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the "Metaphysical" poets of whom the most famous is [[John Donne]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The witty sally of a Baroque writer, [[John Dryden]], against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

{{quote|He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, ''where nature only'' should reign; and ''perplexes the minds'' of the fair sex with ''nice''&lt;ref&gt;'Nice' in the sense of 'finely reasoned.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''speculations'' of philosophy when he should ''engage their hearts'' and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1957"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gardner, Helen |title=Metaphysical Poets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS_EXPFEtKwC&amp;q=dryden#v=snippet&amp;q=dryden&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press, London |year=1957 |accessdate=2014-08-15|isbn=9780140420388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} (italics added)}}

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]]:

{{quote|The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the ‘stylish style’ of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 1991, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] complex [[polyphonic]] music made in France in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1946–47, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is now usually referred to as the ''[[ars subtilior]]''.

===Mannerism and theatre===
''The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context'' by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1992,{{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in [[Jacques Callot]]'s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's ''Balli di Sfessania'' (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1994, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commedia dell'arte, ''disegno interno'', and the ''discordia concors''====
Important corollaries exist between the ''disegno interno'', which substituted for the ''disegno esterno'' (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist ''discordia concors'' (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

=== Neo-Mannerism ===
According to art critic [[Jerry Saltz]], "Neo-Mannerism" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are "squeezing the life out of the art world".&lt;ref name="saltz"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Jerry Saltz on Art’s Insidious New Cliché: Neo-Mannerism |last=Saltz |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Saltz |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/jerry-saltz-on-arts-insidious-new-clich.html |publisher=Vulture |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers "have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary".&lt;ref name="saltz" /&gt;

{{Citation style|date=January 2010}}

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

==Artist group==
The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

'''New Age''' is a term applied to a range of [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices that developed in [[Western culture|Western nations]] during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly [[eclecticism|eclectic]] structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of '''spiritual''' or '''Mind, Body, Spirit''' and rarely use the term "New Age" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the '''New Age movement''', although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a [[milieu]] or [[zeitgeist]].

&lt;!--History of the New Age--&gt;
As a form of [[Western esotericism]], the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Franz Mesmer]], as well as the ideas of [[Spiritualism]], [[New Thought]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the [[UFO religions]] of the 1950s, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Human Potential Movement]], also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term "New Age" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.  

&lt;!--Core Beliefs--&gt;
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. [[Theology|Theologically]], the New Age typically adopts a belief in a [[Holism|holistic]] form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as [[angel]]s and [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]], with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]]. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming [[Age of Aquarius]], from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of [[alternative medicine]], and an emphasis on a New Age "science" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.

&lt;!--Sociological factors--&gt;
Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]]. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of [[religious studies]].

==Definitions==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="One of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism."|source=— Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} }}

The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define,{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1p=363|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=1|3a1=Granholm|3y=2013|3p=59}} with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope.{{sfn|Granholm|2013|p=59}} The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains "among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=1}}

The scholar of religion [[Paul Heelas]] characterised the New Age as "...an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of "...the same (or very similar) ''[[lingua franca]]'' to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be [[Spiritual transformation| transformed]]."{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=1–2}} Similarly, the historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] termed it "a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are "largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an ''air de famille''".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} According to Hammer, this New Age was a "fluid and fuzzy [[cult]]ic milieu".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=14}} The [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] described the New Age as "...an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities" that are united by their "...expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential."{{sfn|York|1995|pp=1–2}}

The scholar of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] adopted a different approach by asserting that "New Age" was "a ''label'' attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it" and that as a result it "means very different things to different people".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=1}} He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered "a unified ideology or ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}} although he believed that it could be considered a "more or less unified 'movement'."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular ''movement''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruce|1y=1998|1p=24|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=9|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=22}} As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a [[milieu]],{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=24}} while scholar of religion [[George D. Chryssides]] suggested that it could be understood as "a counter-cultural ''Zeitgeist''".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not.{{sfn|York|2001|p=364}}
Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term "New Age" in reference to themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1pp=1–2|2a1= Heelas|2y=1996|2p=17|3a1=York|3y=2001|3p=364|4a1= Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=200|5a1=Partridge|5y=2004|5p=2|6a1=MacKian|6y=2012|6p=5}} Some even express active hostility to the term.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=177}} Rather than terming themselves "New Agers", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual "seekers",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}} and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=25}} In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term "New Age" was "optional, episodic and declining overall", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=197}} Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use.{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=7}} MacKian proposed "everyday spirituality" as an alternate term.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=12}}

While acknowledging that "New Age" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] stated that it remained a useful [[etic]] category for scholars to use because, "There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement."{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that "New Age" is a "theoretical concept" does not "undermine its usefulness or employability"; he drew comparisons with "[[Hinduism]]", a similar "western etic piece of vocabulary" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=13}}

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to "New Age spirituality" and "New Age religion".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with [[organized religion]]—and instead describe their practices as "spirituality".{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1pp=214–215|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=48}} Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=243|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=38}} York described the New Age as a [[new religious movement]] (NRM).{{sfn|York|1995|p=2}} Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation;{{sfnm|1a1= Heelas|1y=1996|1p=9|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=200}} Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=9}} Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as "a religion" in itself.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=19}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified "movement". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} }}

The New Age is also a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=33|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Hammer|3y=2001|3p=9}} Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of "popular culture criticism", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion and rationalism,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=331}} adding that "New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}}

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the [[cultic milieu]].{{sfnm|1a1= Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=522|2a1= Hammer|2y=2001|2p=28|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=17}} This concept, developed by the sociologist [[Colin Campbell (sociologist)|Colin Campbell]], refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=28–29}}

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of "[[folk religions]]" in that it seeks to deal with [[existential]] questions regarding subjects like death and disease in "an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of [[bricolage]] from already available narratives and rituals".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the ''social camp'', represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the ''occult camp'', instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the ''spiritual camp'', represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on [[self-development | individual development]].{{sfn|York|1995|pp=36–37}}

===Terminology===

The term ''new age'', along with related terms like ''new era'' and ''new world'', long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the [[Great Seal of the United States]], designed in 1782, proclaims a "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proclaimed that "all mankind is entering a new age".{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=25}}  In 1864 the American [[Swedenborgian]] [[Warren Felt Evans]] published ''The New Age and its Message'', while in 1907 [[Alfred Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] began editing a weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]''.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=17}} The concept of a coming "new age" that would be inaugurated by the [[Second Coming | return to Earth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] was a theme in the poetry of [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] and [[Johanna Brandt]],{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}} and then also appeared in the work of the American Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]], who used the term prominently in such titles as ''Disciplineship in the New Age'' (1944) and ''Education in the New Age'' (1954).{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}}

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming "New Age" and prominently used the term accordingly.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=55}} The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=99}}
Sutcliffe therefore expressed the view that while the term "New Age" had originally been an "apocalyptic emblem", it would only be later that it became "a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=29}}

==History==

===Antecedents===
{{double image|right|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.jpg|141|CGJung.jpg|140|Prominent esoteric thinkers who influenced the New Age include [[Helena Blavatsky]] (left) and [[Carl Jung]] (right)}}

According to scholar [[Nevill Drury]], the New Age has a "tangible history",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were "surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=323}} Similarly, Hammer thought that "source amnesia" was a "building block of a New Age worldview", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=180}}

As a form of Western esotericism,{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}} the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Ellwood|1992|p=59}} Following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend ''[[occultism]]'', and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=406–407}}

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=424–429|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=42}} Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and [[hypnotist]] [[Franz Mesmer]], who claimed the existence of a force known as "[[animal magnetism]]" running through the human body.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=430–435|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=41}} The establishment of [[Spiritualism]], an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=435|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=24|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=37}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Most of the beliefs which characterise the New Age were already present by the end of the 19th century, even to such an extent that one may legitimately wonder whether the New Age brings anything new at all."|source=— Historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=482–483}} }}

A further major influence on the New Age was the [[Theosophical Society]], an occult group co-founded by the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. In her books ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on [[comparative religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=448–455|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24|4a1=Kemp|4y=2004|4p=39}} Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist [[Edgar Cayce]], who founded the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=60|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2p=66}} Another influence was [[New Thought]], which developed in late nineteenth century [[New England]] as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=35|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=455–462|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=38}} Another prominent influence was the psychologist [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=46–47|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=69–70}} 
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]], an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Drury|2004|pp=27–28}}

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the [[UFO religion]]s of the 1950s, which he termed a "proto-New Age movement".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=95–96}} Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=95–96|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=72}} Examples of such groups included the [[Aetherius Society]], founded in the UK in 1955, and the [[Heralds of the New Age]], established in New Zealand in 1956.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=72, 74}}

[[File:Barrel House.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Wooden barrel house in forest with surrounding footpaths|This barrel house was the first dwelling constructed at the [[Findhorn Ecovillage]].]]

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is rooted in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=15}} Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms "New Age" and "Age of Aquarius" – used in reference to a coming era – were found within it,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=108–109}} for instance appearing on adverts for the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=109}} and in the lyrics of "[[Aquarius (song)|Aquarius]]", the opening song of the 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=10|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=109|3a1=Sutcliffe|3a2=Gilhus|3y=2013|3p=4}}
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the [[San Francisco Zen Center]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Soka Gakkai]], the [[Inner Peace Movement]], the [[Church of All Worlds]], and the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=53–54}} Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century,{{sfn|Brown|1992|pp=88–89}} many of these new developments were variants of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]], which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the [[Asian Exclusion Act]] in 1965.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=54–55}} In 1962 the [[Esalen Institute]] was established in [[Big Sur]], [[California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36–37|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51}} Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to [[humanistic psychology]], and from this, the [[human potential movement]] emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36, 41–43|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=8|3a1=Heelas|3y=1996|3p=53}}

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the "light" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=20}} The most prominent of these groups was the [[Findhorn Foundation]], which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]] in 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51|5a1=Chryssides|5y=2007|5p=8}} Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to circa 120 residents by 1972.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=118}} In October 1965, the founder of Findhorn, [[Peter Caddy]], attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; titled "The Significance of the Group in the New Age", it was held at [[Attingham Park]] over the course of a weekend.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=83–84}}

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] point out, the New Age phenomenon represents "a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought".{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}} Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained "distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking".{{sfn|York|1995|p=1}}

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} }}

By the early 1970s, use of the term "New Age" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the "emblem" of the "New Age" had been passed from the "subcultural pioneers" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of "countercultural baby boomers" between ''circa'' 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term "New Age" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=112}} In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for "alternatives" to mainstream society.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} In doing so, the "New Age" became a banner under which to bring together the wider "cultic milieu" of American society.{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}}

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the [[commune]] movement,{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=54}} but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and [[hippie]] subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}}
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=18}} whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=12}} This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and [[Anthroposophy]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the ''New Age sensu stricto'', or "New Age in the strict sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}}

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the ''New Age sensu lato'', or "New Age in the wider sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}} Stores that came to be known as "New Age shops" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=126–127}}This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first1=John|last1=Algeo|first2=Adele S. |last2=Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like [[Amazon.com]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}}

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term "New Age", although it was popularised in books like [[David Spangler]]'s 1977 work ''Revelation: The Birth of a New Age'' and [[Mark Satin]]'s 1979 book ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=124}} [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1982 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=9}} Other terms that were employed synonymously with "New Age" in this milieu included "Green", "Holistic", "Alternative", and "Spiritual".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=128}}

1971 witnessed the foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] by [[Werner H. Erhard]], a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=58–60}} Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of [[Helen Schucman]]'s ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=25–26}} Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=26–27}} During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of [[pilgrimage]] for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=29}}

[[File:New Age Shrine Glastonbury - geograph.org.uk - 167848.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A new age shrine. |New Age shrine in [[Glastonbury]], England]]

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "[[Harmonic Convergence]]" [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=ix}} Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the "enterprise culture" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=168}}

The claims of channelers [[Jane Roberts]] ([[Seth Material]]), Helen Schucman (''[[A Course in Miracles]]''), [[J. Z. Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to [[automatic writing]]) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as [[Ram Dass]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kyle|1y=1995|1pp=66–67|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35}} Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Helen Schucman's 1975 publication ''A Course in Miracles'',{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1pp=35–36|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} and [[James Redfield]]'s 1993 work ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1p=127|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} A variety of these books were [[best seller]]s, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=17}} The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}}

New Age ideas influenced the development of [[rave]] culture in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=168}} In Britain during the 1980s, the term "[[New Age Travellers]]" came into use,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}} although York characterised this term as "a misnomer created by the media".{{sfn|York|2001|p=370}} These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely,{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=8}} with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that "New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=34}} The term "New Age" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}}

===Decline or transformation?: 1990–present===

By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term "New Age" as a marketing device.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=35}} In 1994, the scholar of religion [[Gordon J. Melton]] presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as "New Age" anymore, the New Age had died.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=178}} In 2001, Hammer observed that the term "New Age" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}} He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative, and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}

Other scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that "New Age is still very much alive".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=179}} Hammer himself stated that "the New Age ''movement'' may be on the wane, but the wider New Age ''religiosity''... shows no sign of disappearing".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=75}} MacKian suggested that the New Age "movement" had been replaced by a wider "New Age sentiment" which had come to pervade "the socio-cultural landscape" of Western countries.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=7}} Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] consulted an astrologer, British [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] established a school devoted to communicating with angels.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=146}} 
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as "Mind, Body, Spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=17}} 

In 2015, the scholar of religion [[Hugh Urban]] argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: "According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come".{{sfn|Urban|2015|p=11}}

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main article|Spiritual but not religious|List of New Age topics}}

===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===

The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=201–202|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=21–23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=26}} It exhibits what Heelas termed "unmediated individualism",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=21–23}} and reflects a world-view that is "radically democratic".{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=124}} It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=26–27|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=119}} This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=25}} Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=34}} Hammer stated that "a belief in the existence of a core or true Self" is a "recurring theme" in New Age texts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=11}} The concept of "[[personal growth]]" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=46|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=188}} while Heelas noted that "for participants spirituality ''is'' life-itself".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=27}}

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=163}} Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=118–119}} New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=28}} seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=8}} The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=36}} This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=32}} York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within [[late modernity|late modern]] capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} 

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to "a very vague claim" about underlying global unity.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=139}} Certain societies are more usually chosen over others;{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2001|1p=199|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=49}} examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the [[Essenes]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and ancient extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=47}} As noted by Hammer: "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=199}} According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic "Other" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=48}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

[[File:Snoqualmie Moondance meditation 02.jpg|thumb|right|New Age meditation group at the Snoqualmie Moondance festival, 1992]]

A belief in [[divinity]] is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=182–183}} New Age [[theology]] exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=185}} This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is [[Holism|holistic]], thus frequently being described with such terms as an "Ocean of Oneness", "Infinite Spirit", "Primal Stream", "One Essence", and "Universal Principle".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as "Mind", "Consciousness", and "Intelligence",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=186–187}} while a third is the description of divinity as a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=187}} A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a "life force", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of [[love]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=187–188}}

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=120}} Various [[creation myths]] have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=122–123}} In contrast, some New Agers emphasise the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=128}} The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=119|2a1=Drury|2y=2004|2p=11}} in doing so rejecting both the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of Judeo-Christian thought and the [[reductionism]] of Cartesian science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=119}} A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=23}} The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as "droplet of divinity", "inner Godhead", and "divine self".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=204}} Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding '[[subtle bodies]]',{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=222–223}} a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a "Higher Self" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through [[intuition]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=211–212}}

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=304}} with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=305}} An additional common theme is that human souls – once living in a spiritual world – then descended into a world of matter.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=307–308}}
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=115}} This physical world is hence seen as "a domain for learning and growth" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=116–117}} There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than [[Darwinian evolution]], this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=158–160}}

===Spirit and channeling===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the flood of channeled material which has been published or delivered to "live" audiences in the last two decades, there is much indeed that is trivial, contradictory, and confusing. The authors of much of this material make claims that, while not necessarily untrue or fraudulent, are difficult or impossible for the reader to verify. A number of other channeled documents address issues more immediately relevant to the human condition. The best of these writings are not only coherent and plausible, but eloquently persuasive and sometimes disarmingly moving."|source=— Academic Suzanne Riordan, 1992.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=107}} }}

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on "[[spirit]]", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=51, 117}} Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as "workers ''for'' spirit", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=145}} They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance the unexpected appearance of a feather.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=142–143}} New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=84, 143}}  

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, [[guardian angel]]s, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=197, 198}} New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=198}} The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=189–190}}

Although not present in every New Age group,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=105}} a core belief within the milieu is in [[mediumship|channeling]].{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24}} This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of [[trance]], can act "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} These sources are varyingly described as being [[God]], [[gods]] and [[goddesses]], [[ascended masters]], [[spirit guide]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[angel]]s, [[Deva (New Age)|devas]], historical figures, the [[collective unconscious]], [[elemental]]s, or [[nature spirit]]s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of "articulated revelation",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=24}} and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=27–28}}

Prominent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=22|2a1=Riordan|2y=1992|2pp=108–110|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=28}} The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically "echoed each other in tone and content", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=110}}
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=108}} although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of "channeling" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=26–27}} Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to [[Spiritualism]] and [[psychical research]], the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=23}}

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified [[astrology|astrologically]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=102, 302}} It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}} New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on [[Lost lands|lost continents]] such as Atlantis, [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of [[Ancient Egypt]] were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=309–314}}
New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the [[Age of Pisces]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} 
Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were "extremely sketchy" in their use of description,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} reflecting little interest in [[historiography]] and conflating history with [[myth]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=324}} He also noted that they were highly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] in placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the centre of historical development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}}

[[File:Venice ast sm.jpg|thumb|left|Astrological ideas hold a central place in the New Age]]

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the [[Age of Aquarius]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=94}} which Melton has characterised as a "New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about."{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=19}} In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as "highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=28}} and has also been cited as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic movement]].{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=24}} Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=333}} There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=334–335}} others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=335}} author José Argüelles predicted its start [[2012 phenomenon|in 2012]],{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=72}} and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=335–336}}

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=336}} Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the "moderate" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=339–340}} Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=341—343}} Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=102}} 

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through [[human agency]]; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=74}} Ferguson for instance claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the "Aquarian conspiracy" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=70}} Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=75–76}} with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=73}}

===Healing and alternative medicine===

Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and [[alternative medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ellwood|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=37|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3p=42|4a1=Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=174}}&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"&gt;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=46–47}} Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal "[[illness]]" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure [[disease]], and thus has an affinity with most forms of [[traditional medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Albanese|1y=1992|1pp=81–82|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=42–43|3a1=Sutcliffe|3y=2003a|3p=176}} Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing,{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2pp=176, 178|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=160}} although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=160}}

[[File:Siete chakras.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Reiki]] is one of the alternative therapies commonly found in the New Age movement.]]

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=48}} However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the [[Human Potential Movement]], which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=48–49}} Hanegraaff described [[transpersonal psychology]] as the "theoretical wing" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=50–51}} Closely connected to this is the [[Neoshamanism|shamanic consciousness]] current, which argues that the [[shamanism|shaman]] was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=52}}

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being [[holistic health]]. This emerged in the 1970s out of the [[free clinic]] movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=53–54}} It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=54}} A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including [[acupuncture]], reiki, [[biofeedback]], [[chiropractic]], [[yoga]], [[kinesiology]], [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] [[iridology]], [[massage]] and other forms of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[meditation]] and [[Visual perception|visualisation]], nutritional therapy, [[psychic healing]], [[herbal medicine]], [[crystal healing|healing using crystals]], metals, music, [[chromotherapy]], and reincarnation therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=37|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=54–55|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=30}} The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age;{{sfn|Albanese|1992|p=79}} this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=162}}
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"/&gt;

==="New Age science"===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being."|source=— New Ager [[Nevill Drury]], 2004.{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=11}} }}

According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} while Hess noted how New Agers have "a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=4}}
Although New Agers typically reject [[rationalism]], the [[scientific method]], and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|New Physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as [[David Bohm]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]], had backgrounds as professional scientists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Hanegraaff identified "New Age science" as a form of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=64}} 

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Figures in the New Age movement—most notably [[Fritjof Capra]] in his ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of [[mysticism]], thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=128–129}} Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=155–156|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}}

Despite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss "New Age science" as [[pseudo-science]], or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of [[parapsychology]].{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=11}} In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry,{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=68}} believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a [[paradigm shift]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}}

===Ethics and afterlife===

There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=35}} although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=281}} Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic [[good and evil]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=277}} negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=236–237, 278}}
It rejects the Christian emphasis on [[sin]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=294–295}} It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=293}} Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=240}} Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=240—241}} and the visualisation of a white light.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=242}}

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a "pressing problem requiring an answer" in the New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=258}} A belief in [[reincarnation]] is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=York|2y=2001|2p=364|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=109}} In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=263}} although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=264}} Many New Agers believe in [[karma]], treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=286}}
In much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=266}} It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=262}} Prominent New Age writers like [[Shakti Gawain]] and [[Louise Hay]] therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=234}} At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=271–275}} Some practitioners espouse the idea of a "soul group" or "soul family", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}} Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a "universal energy" on bodily death.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.|source=— Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=223}} }}

In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|York|1995|p=42}} The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as "New Agers" renders it difficult to determine how many practitioners there are.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=112}} He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=120}} In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=4}}

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=223–224}} The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=121|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=53}} Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=220–221}} approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=220}}
The movement is strongly gendered; sociologist Ciara O'Connor argues that it shows a tension between commodification and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole: an exploration of women's choices in the holistic and New Age movement in Ireland". 220–39 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe described the "typical" participant in the New Age milieu as being "a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}}

[[File:Rave in the Henge 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Stonehenge at night, with revellers inside|[[Stonehenge]] is a site visited by New Age pilgrims, as seen in this midsummer rave]]

In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the [[baby boomer]] generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=90}} 
Heelas added that within that broad demographic, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=136}} He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that [[modernity]] is in crisis.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=137–138}} He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=142}} He believed that many individuals had been "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=172}} with the New Age attracting "expressive" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=161–162}} It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=173}} He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of [[religious conversion]],{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=186}} others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=183}}

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=117}} Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of "serious part-timers" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of "casual part-timers" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=118–119}} MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are "consultative" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are "serious" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=73–74}} Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=52}}

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] over those of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He added that most New Agers "soundly rejected" the agenda of former Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Social communities===

MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was "an inherently ''social'' mode of spirituality", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=136}}
MacKian suggested that these communities "may look very different" from those of traditional religious groups.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=135}}

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=131}}

==Commercial aspects==

Some New Agers advocate living in a [[simple living|simple]] and [[sustainable living|sustainable]] manner to reduce humanity's impact on the [[natural resource]]s of Earth; and they shun [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spring|first=Joel H.|title=How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGO's, and the Decline of the Nation-state|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, US|year=2004|edition=illustrated|page=119|chapter=Chapter 4: Love the Biosphere: Environmental Ideologies Shaping Global Society|isbn=978-0-8058-4915-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|accessdate=2009-03-27|archivedate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a [[sense of community]] to counter [[social disintegration]]; this has been attempted through the formation of [[intentional communities]], where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce argued that in seeking to "denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place.{{sfn|Bruce|1998|pp=32–33}} Heelas however cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on "flimsy evidence".{{sfn|Heelas|1998|p=258}}

New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement.{{sfn|York|1995|pp=40–41}} Notable examples include the [[Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Holly Hock Farm]] near to [[Vancouver]], the [[Wrekin Trust]] in [[West Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], and the [[Skyros Centre]] in [[Skyros]].{{sfn|York|1995|p=41}}

Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=77–78}}

===Fairs and festivals===

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, [[fair]]s, and [[festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
New Age fairs – sometimes known as "Mind, Body, Spirit fairs", "psychic fairs", or "alternative health fairs" – are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=181–183}} A prominent example is the [[Mind Body Spirit Festival]], held annually in the United Kingdom,{{sfnm|1a1=Partridge|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=24}} at which – the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted – one could encounter "a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=65}} Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=24}}

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===

A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=60–62}} Commenting on this "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=38}} The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=6}} This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=85}}

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=62–65}} During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[General Motors]]—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force,{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=127}} although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health.{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=133}} However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining [[Profit (economics)|profit]] has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=23|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}} with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=358–361}} In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise".{{sfn|York|1995|p=40}}

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=34}}

===Music===
{{See also|List of new-age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
The term "[[New Age music]]" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of [[ambient music]], a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}
Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of [[stress management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition |editor-last=Lehrer |editor-first=Paul M. |editor2=Robert L. Woolfolk |editor3=Wesley E. Sime |year=2007|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-59385-000-5|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]],&lt;ref name=Birosik&gt;Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, Australian [[didgeredoo]]s and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Birosik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werkhoven /&gt;

==Politics==

While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Richard (1995).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8 ("The New Age Reaches Out: Politics and Economics").  {{ISBN|978-0-7618-0010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with "our socio-psychological problems".{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=23}}  Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, "significant numbers" of them were "trying to make the planet a better place on which to live," {{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}} and scholar J. Gordon Melton's ''New Age Encyclopedia'' (1990) included an entry called "New Age politics". {{sfn|Melton|1990| pp=323–325}}  Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}}

===Ideas===

Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse,{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} ranging from [[far right politics|far-right]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] through to [[liberalism|liberal]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]].{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Accordingly, Kyle stated that "New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of "world-realigning infrapolitics" that undermines the [[disenchantment]] of modern Western society.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Mark Satin in 2011.jpg
|141|BENJAMIN CREME 2006.jpg|139|Writers who have espoused political ideas influenced by New Age perspectives included [[Mark Satin]] (left) and [[Benjamin Creme]] (right).}}

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=837}} New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete".{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} The New Ager [[Mark Satin]] for instance spoke of "New Age politics" as a politically radical "third force" that was "neither left nor right". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the "institutional and economic symptoms" of society's problems, his "New Age politics" would focus on "psychocultural roots" of these issues.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=833}} Ferguson regarded New Age politics as "a kind of Radical Centre", one that was "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=832–833}} Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the ''Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}}  In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological "systems view" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}} [[Corinne McLaughlin]] argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new "spiritual politics" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, Alan J. (1999).  ''From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms''.  Praeger Publishers / Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&amp;nbsp;179.  {{ISBN|978-0-275-96151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Agers advocate [[globalisation]] and [[Glocalization|localisation]], but reject [[nationalism]] and the role of the [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=842}} Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=842–843}} Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=843}} [[Benjamin Creme]] conversely argued that "the Christ," a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One," would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the [[United Nations]]; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=845}} Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of [[democracy]] and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of [[representative democracy]] and [[majority rule]], thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Groups===

[[File:New World Alliance 1980.jpg|thumb |220px| right |alt=Twenty people sitting in a circle |The [[New World Alliance]] was one of several New Age political groups in the 1970s and 1980s.]]

Scholars have noted several New Age political groups.  Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Marilyn (1980).  ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s''.  Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., distributed by Houghton Mifflin, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–235.  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-191-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Satin,&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (1978).  ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''. Delta Books / Dell Publishing Co., pp.&amp;nbsp;219, 345.  {{ISBN|978-0-440-55700-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, Steven M. (1982).  ''Getting Saved from the Sixties: Moral Meaning in Conversion and Cultural Change''.  University of California Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;267–270.  {{ISBN|978-0-520-05228-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1975 by California state legislator [[John Vasconcellos]] and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;267, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], headed by author [[Willis Harman]].  It advocated a change in consciousness – in "basic underlying assumptions" –  in order to come to grips with global crises.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=108–109}}  Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and ''Earth at Omega'' author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.{{sfn|Kyle|1995|p=67}}

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others.  According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities.  Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence.{{sfn|Melton|1990|p=324}}  Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos.&lt;ref&gt;Stein,  Arthur (1985).  ''Seeds of the Seventies: Values, Work, and Commitment in Post-Vietnam America''. University Press of New England, p.&amp;nbsp;136.  {{ISBN|978-0-87451-343-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar James R. Lewis counted "Green politics" as one of the New Age's more visible activities.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}}  One academic book claims that the [[History of the Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party movement]] began as an initiative of a handful of activists including [[Charlene Spretnak]], co-author of a "'new age' interpretation" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's ''Green Politics''), and Mark Satin, author of ''New Age Politics''.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, John (1998).

Temple University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;200. {{ISBN|978-1-56639-516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens' founding document, the "Ten Key Values" statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greta Gaard|Gaard, Greta]] (1998).  ''Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens''. Temple University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143.  {{ISBN|978-1-56639-569-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 21st century===

[[File:Marianne Williamson.jpg|thumb |180px| right| alt=Head shot of a well-dressed woman with straight black hair |New Age author [[Marianne Williamson]] campaigned for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2013–2014.]]

While the term "New Age" may have fallen out of favor,{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} scholar [[George Chryssides]] notes that the New Age by whatever name is "still alive and active" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}  In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book ''Radical Middle'' (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgore, Ed (June 2004).  "Good Government: Time to Stop Bashing the Two-Party System". ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59.

In 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]], telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed.&lt;ref name=Lovett /&gt;  "America has swerved from its ethical center", she said.&lt;ref name=Lovett&gt;Lovett, Ian (13 November 2013).

==Reception==

===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book ''[[The Cultural Creatives]]'', what they called the media's "zest for attacking" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 [[Lance Morrow]] essay in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} Nearly a decade earlier, ''Time'' had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, "'''Om....''' THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (7 December 1987), vol. 130, issue no. 23, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story itself, by former ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' editor [[Otto Friedrich]], was sub-titled, "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Otto (7 December 1987).  "New Age Harmonies".  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, vol. 130, issue no. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist [[Richard Bradley (writer)|Richard Blow]] entitled simply, "Moronic Convergence".&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Richard (25 January 1988).  "Moronic Convergence".  ''[[The New Republic]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms.  For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to "stereotype" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the "New Age glamour" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.{{sfnp|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=104–105}}

===Academia===
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first academics to study the New Age was Wouter Hanegraaff]]

Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as [[Robert Ellwood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=3}} This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=x}} Having been influenced by the U.S. [[anti-cult movement]], much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=15}} The "first truly scholarly study" of the phenomenon was an [[edited volume]] put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}}

In 1994, [[Christoph Bochinger]] published his study of the New Age in Germany, ''"New Age" und moderne Religion''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=21}} In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=21–22}} That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', a historical analysis of New Age texts;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=4–6}} Hammer later described it as having "a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=22}} Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of its practitioners.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=13}}

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on "macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries" of the "movement", while the second wave featured "more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}} Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}}
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what "religion" is.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=5}} By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=15}}

===Christian perspectives===

Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}} Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist wing]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=201}} In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=152}} During that decade, evangelical writers such as [[Constance Cumbey]], [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]], [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], and [[Douglas Groothuis]] published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating [[conspiracy theories]] regarding the origin and purpose of the movement.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=154}} The most successful such publication however was [[Frank E. Peretti]]'s 1986 novel ''[[This Present Darkness]]'', which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with [[feminism]] and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=156}}

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], and [[Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}}
The Roman Catholic Church published ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, [[feng shui]], and crystal healing.&lt;ref name="BBC Vatican"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm|title=Vatican sounds New Age alert|date=2003-02-04|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W.

Fitzgerald|Michael Fitzgerald]], then-president of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".&lt;ref name="Holy See"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html |title=Presentations of Holy See's Document on "New Age" |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Michael L. |last2=Poupard |first2=Paul |year=2003 |work=Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life: a Christian Reflection on the "New Age" |publisher=Roman Catholic Church |accessdate=2010-11-06 |location=Vatican City}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the [[New Age Catholics]], [[Christaquarians]], and [[Christians Awakening to a New Awareness]], all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|pp=21–22}}

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Neopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future."|source=— Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}} }}

An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between the New Age movement and contemporary [[Paganism]], or [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques.{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a "significant overlap" between the two religious movements,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=vii}} while [[Aidan A. Kelly]] stated that Paganism "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways".{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=136}} Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1pp=364–365|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=9}} Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those that pre-dated the movement – other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=78}} Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of [[occulture]] ([[occult]] culture) that merge at points.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=78}}

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a [[Universalism|universalist]] message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] and those embracing a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animistic]] theology.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=79}} Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using "New Age" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=9}}
Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1992|1p=139|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} with some Pagans pronouncing the word "newage" to rhyme with "[[sewage]]".{{sfn|Blain|Wallis|2007|p=6}}

===Non-Western and indigenous responses===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the case of New Age, its solipsism, coupled with its advocacy of free market principles, opens the world's spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation and even capitalistic imperialism. Not only does it encourage a paradoxical homogenizing to the cultural standards of North Atlantic civilization, exemplified in its affirmation that 'we are all one', but it also carries an implicit judgement of inferior status for non-hegemonic cultures, inasmuch as they are not considered to be the ones who decide what is to be shared and what is not."|source=— Sociologist Michael York.{{sfn|York|2001|pp=367–368}} }}

One of the most contentious aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the [[private property]] of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of [[Third World]] societies.{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}} These have included "Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian ''[[ayahuasca]]'' and ''San Pedro'' ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, [[Qigong|Qi Gong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]".{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}}

The New Age has been accused of [[cultural imperialism]], [[cultural appropriation|misappropriating]] the sacred ceremonies, and abuse of the intellectual and cultural property of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (June 10, 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]."

===Political writers and activists===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="New Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism.  Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism.  Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ...  The New Age 'person' is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances.  So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ..."|source=— Scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], 1991.{{sfn|Ross|1991|p=69}} }}

Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam's Sons, Chap. 5 ("Gaia: The Transformation State").  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-823-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne (1999), cited above, Chap. 11 ("Spiritual Politics").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, Chap. 7 ("A Great Current of Change").&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, some political scientists launched the "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" of the [[American Political Science Association]],&lt;ref&gt;"Preface: Paths to Transformational Politics".  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xi.  {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3945-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the "transformational politics" concept was meant to subsume such terms as ''new age'' and ''new paradigm''.&lt;ref&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Ed.  "Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?"   In Woolpert et al. (1998), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] suggested that New Age political ideas – however muddled and naïve – could help [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressives]] construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. {{sfn|Ross|1991|pp=65–72 ("New Age politics" sub-chapter)}}  In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as "new socio-political thinking" and "New Economics",{{sfn|Rose|2005b|p=165}} topics Rose discussed in his book ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus'', issued by a European academic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Stuart (2005).  ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus''. [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], Chap. 8 ("Community Activity").  {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7241-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively.  On the political right, author [[George Weigel]] argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham{{sfn|Hexham|1992| p=54}} and Kemp,{{sfn|Kemp|2004| p=52}} warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Douglas (1987).  "Politics: Building an International Platform".  In Hoyt, Karen, ed., ''The New Age Rage''. Fleming H. Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93 and 103–105.  {{ISBN|978-0-8007-5257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;169.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-79252-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics: Corporate Power and the Decline of the Public Sphere''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–72.  {{ISBN|978-1-57230-504-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic, [[Dana L. Cloud]], wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Dana L. (1998). ''Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetorics of Therapy''. Sage Publications, Chap. 6 ("The New Age of Post-Marxism").  {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0506-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she faulted it for not being opposed to the [[capitalist system]], or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud (1998), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;144, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=8}} This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes [[elitism]] and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|pp=6–7}}  New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized.  Journalist [[Harvey Wasserman]] suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Harvey (31 August 1985). "The New Age Movement: The Politics of Transcendence".  ''[[The Nation]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;147 (discussing the ideas of activist Shelly Kellman).&lt;/ref&gt; Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to "extended meetings and minimal results",{{sfn|Melton|1990| p=324}} and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both "too visionary and too vague" to last.&lt;ref&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).

'''Nightshift''' is a free monthly music magazine in [[Oxford]], [[England]]. Distributed via music venues, pubs, and shops, it provides music news, gig listings, and reviews for the city and surrounding area.

== History ==
First published in March 1991, it was originally titled ''Curfew'', and continued under that name until the end of 1994, when the main [[Music venue|venues]] in  Oxford - [[O2 Academy Oxford|The Venue]], the [[Jericho Tavern]], and the Hollybush - closed down temporarily and there was little music scene to cover. ''Curfew'' had the earliest reviews and interviews with [[Radiohead]] and [[Supergrass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-33176717|title = Radiohead, Foals and 25 years of discovering Oxford music|work=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1995, publication started anew as ''Nightshift'',&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2000/07/06/Oxfordshire+Archive/6630975.Preview__Nightshift_night/ Preview: Nightshift night]", "[[Oxford Mail]]", July 6, 2000, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of the opening of venues [[O2 Academy Oxford|The Zodiac]] and The Point.

== Content ==
Each month has a feature on one local artist or group, with their picture appearing on the front cover, and an interview inside. There are occasional exceptions to this format, for example the November 2010 issue featured a round up of the [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] scene, and July 2010 covered [[Truck Festival]].

The magazine includes local music news, [[Release (music)|new release]], [[live concert|gig]], and [[demo (music)|demo]], [[review]]s, and a gig guide for the month. [[Advertisement]]s support the magazine's production and distribution.

In the ''Demos'' section, editor Munro reviews demos sent by local musicians, with no pretence of being unbiased. The reviews are entirely based upon his opinions and preferences, but — despite sometimes harsh words for music deemed lacking — there is genuine constructive criticism, and many bands later submit improved demos.&lt;ref&gt;"New Year's Day Unsigned Music Guide", "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00cs8y8 BBC Radio Oxford, BBC Introducing]", January 1, 2011, accessed January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The best and worst entries in a month are put in ''Demo of the month'' and ''The Demo dumper'', respectively.

{{quote|text=Parachutes are apparently a five-piece band, though they sound more like some sausage-fingered bedroom hermit collapsing on the random play buttons of every instrument in his room and deluding himself that it’s something akin to ''avant garde'' genius.|sign=Ronan Munro|source=The Demo Dumper, Nightshift August 2009.}}

The instructions for submitting demos include the warning "If you can’t handle criticism, please don’t send us your demo".

The [http://nightshiftmag.co.uk/ Nightshift online] web site features [[PDF]] downloads of the magazine since 2005, and a [[Internet forum|bulletin board]] for local musicians, fans, and promoters.

==The Punt==
Nightshift organises ''The Punt'', an annual music event typically featuring around 20 unsigned Oxfordshire-based bands in five venues around Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bearder, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2009/03/02/punt09.shtml The Punt]", "BBC Oxford", March 2, 2009, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Punt was originally conceived during the warm-up for [[Oxford#Music|Oxford Sound City]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/archive/2001/05/11/Oxfordshire+Archive/6617032.Punters_land_a_festival_gem/ Punters land a festival gem], "Oxford Times", May 11, 2001, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Among the acts that received early exposure after being picked to play at The Punt were [[Young Knives]], [[Stornoway (band)|Stornoway]], [[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish]], [[Fixers (band)|Fixers]] and Elizabeth, the band featuring a teenage Yannis Phillipakis and Jack Bevan, later of [[Foals (band)|Foals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">'''Online aggregation''' is a technique for improving the interactive behavior of [[database systems]] processing expensive analytical queries. Almost all [[database]] operations are performed in batch mode, i.e. the user issues a query and waits till the database has finished processing the entire query. On the contrary, using online aggregation, the user gets estimates of an [[Aggregate function|aggregate query]] in an online fashion as soon as the query is issued. For example, if the final answer is 1000, after k seconds, the user gets the estimates in form of a confidence interval like [990, 1020] with 95% probability. This confidence keeps on shrinking as the system gets more and more samples. 

Online aggregation was proposed in 1997 by Hellerstein, Haas and Wang&lt;ref name=OLA-Hellerstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hellerstein|first1=Joseph M.|last2=Haas|first2=Peter J.|last3=Wang|first3=Helen J.|authorlink1=Joseph M. Hellerstein|title=Online aggregation|journal=SIGMOD Rec.|date=June 1997|volume=26|pages=171–182|doi=10.1145/253262.253291}}&lt;/ref&gt; for group-by aggregation queries over a single table. Later, the authors showed how to evaluate joins in an online fashion.&lt;ref name=RippleJoin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Peter|last2=Hellerstein|first2=Joseph M.|title=Ripple joins for online aggregation|journal=SIGMOD Rec.|date=June 1999|volume=28|issue=2|pages=287–298|doi=10.1145/304181.304208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Jermaine et al. designed and implemented a prototype database system called Database-Online (or DBO) that computes group-by aggregate query over multiple tables in an online and more importantly in a scalable fashion.&lt;ref name=DBO&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jermaine|first1=Chris|last2=Arumugam|first2=Subramanian|last3=Pol|first3=Abhijit|last4=Dobra|first4=Alin|title=Scalable approximate query processing with the DBO engine|journal=SIGMOD|year=2007|pages=725–736|doi=10.1145/1247480.1247560}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the approaches for online aggregation use [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]], which is non-trivial in a distributed environment due to [[Renewal_theory#The_inspection_paradox|inspection paradox]] of renewal reward theory. In 2011, Pansare et al. proposed a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] model to deal with the inspection paradox and implemented online aggregation for a [[MapReduce]]-like environment.&lt;ref name=OLA-MapReduce&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pansare|first1=Niketan|last2=Borkar|first2=Vinayak|last3=Jermaine|first3=Chris|last4=Condie|first4=Tyson|title=Online Aggregation for Large MapReduce Jobs|journal=VLDB|date=August 2011|url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/~np6/Papers/OnlineAggregationForLargeMapReduceJobs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osipkov–Merritt models''' (named for Leonid Osipkov and [[David Merritt]]) are mathematical representations of spherical stellar systems ([[galaxies]], [[star clusters]], [[globular clusters]] etc.).  The Osipkov–Merritt formula generates a one-parameter family of [[phase-space]] [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s that reproduce a specified density profile (representing stars) in a specified gravitational potential (in which the stars move). The density and potential need not be self-consistently related.  
A free parameter adjusts the degree of velocity anisotropy, from [[isotropic]] to completely [[wikt:radial|radial]] motions.  The method is a generalization of [[Eddington's formula]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Eddington|Eddington, A.]] (1916), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916MNRAS..76..572E  The distribution of stars in globular clusters,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'', '''76''', 572&lt;/ref&gt;  for constructing isotropic spherical models.

The method was derived independently by its two eponymous discoverers.&lt;ref&gt;Osipkov, L. P. (1979), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979PAZh....5...77O  Spherical systems of gravitating bodies with an ellipsoidal velocity distribution,] ''Pis'ma v Astron. Zhur.'', '''5''', 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merritt"&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] (1985), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985AJ.....90.1027M  Spherical stellar systems with spheroidal velocity distributions,] ''Astron. J.'', '''90''', 1027&lt;/ref&gt; The latter derivation includes two additional families of models (Type IIa, b) with tangentially anisotropic motions.

==Derivation==

According to [[Jeans's theorem]], the [[phase-space]] density of stars ''f'' must be expressible in terms of the isolating [[integrals of motion]], which in a spherical stellar system are the [[energy]] ''E'' and the [[angular momentum]] ''J''. The Osipkov-Merritt ''[[ansatz]]'' is

:&lt;math&gt;f = f(Q) = f(E+J^2/2r_a^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', the "anisotropy radius", is a free parameter. This ''ansatz'' implies that ''f'' is constant on spheroids in velocity space since
:&lt;math&gt;
2Q = v_r^2 + (1+r^2/r_a^2)v_t^2 + 2\Phi(r)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the radius vector ''r'' and Φ(''r'') is the [[gravitational potential]].

The density ''ρ'' is the integral over velocities of ''f'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = 2\pi\int\int f(E,J) v_t dv_t dv_r
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be written
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = {2\pi\over r^2} \int_\Phi^0 dQ f(Q) \int_0^{2r^2(Q-\Phi)/(1+r^2/r_a^2)} dJ^2\left[2(Q-\Phi)-(J^2/r^2)(1+r^2/r_a^2)\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = {4\pi\over 1+r^2/r_a^2} \int_\Phi^0 dQ \sqrt{2(Q-\Phi)}f(Q).
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has the form of an [[Abel integral equation]] and can be inverted to give ''f'' in terms of ''ρ'':

:&lt;math&gt;

f(Q) = {\sqrt{2}\over 4\pi^2} {d\over dQ} \int_Q^0 {d\Phi\over\sqrt{\Phi-Q}} {d\rho^'\over d\Phi},\ \ \ \ \ \rho^'(\Phi) = \left[1+r(\Phi)^2/r_a^2\right]\rho\left[r(\Phi)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

Following a derivation similar to the one above, the velocity dispersions in an Osipkov–Merritt model satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;
{\sigma_r^2\over\sigma_t^2} = 1 + {r^2\over r_a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The motions are nearly radial (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_r\gg\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;r\gg r_a&lt;/math&gt; and nearly isotropic (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_r\approx\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;r\ll r_a&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a desirable feature, since stellar systems that form via [[gravitational collapse]] have isotropic cores and radially-anisotropic envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;van Albada, T. (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982MNRAS.201..939V  Dissipationless galaxy formation and the R to the 1/4-power law,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'', '''201''', 939&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is assigned too small a value, ''f'' may be negative for some ''Q''. This is a consequence of the fact that spherical mass models can not always be reproduced by purely radial orbits.  Since the number of stars on an orbit can not be negative, values of ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' that generate negative ''f'''s are unphysical. This result can be used to constrain the maximum degree of anisotropy of spherical galaxy models.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In his 1985 paper, Merritt defined two additional families of models ("Type II") that have isotropic cores and tangentially anisotropic envelopes.  Both families assume

:&lt;math&gt;f = f(E-J^2/2r_a^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In Type IIa models, the orbits become completely circular at ''r=r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and remain so at all larger radii.
In Type IIb models, stars beyond ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' move on orbits of various eccentricities, although the motion is always biased toward circular. In both families, the tangential velocity dispersion undergoes a jump as ''r'' increases past ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.

[[C. Marcella Carollo|C. M. Carollo]] ''et al.'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Carollo, C. M. ''et al.'' (1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995MNRAS.276.1131C  Velocity profiles of Osipkov-Merritt models,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35379">'''[[Adsorption]]''' (not to be mistaken for [[Absorption (chemistry)|''absorption'']]) is the accumulation and adhesion of molecules, atoms, ions, or larger particles to a surface, but without surface penetration occurring. The adsorption of larger biomolecules such as proteins is of high physiological relevance, and as such they adsorb with different mechanisms than their molecular or atomic analogs. Some of the major driving forces behind '''protein adsorption''' include: surface energy, intermolecular forces, hydrophobicity, and ionic or electrostatic interaction. By knowing how these factors affect protein adsorption, they can then be manipulated by machining, alloying, and other engineering techniques to select for the most optimal performance in biomedical or physiological applications.

==Relevance==
Many medical devices and products come into contact with the internal surfaces of the body, such as surgical tools and implants. When a non-native material enters the body, the first step of the [[immune response]] takes place and host extracellular matrix and plasma proteins aggregate to the material in attempts to contain, neutralize, or wall-off the injurious agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rechendorff|first=Kristian|title=The influence of surface roughness on protein adsorption|url=http://phys.au.dk/fileadmin/site_files/publikationer/phd/Kristian_Rechen dorff.pdf|work=Thesis|publisher=Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center University of Aarhus, Denmark|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins can facilitate the attachment of various cell types such as [[osteoblasts]] and [[fibroblasts]] that can encourage tissue repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maddikeri|first=RR |author2=S. Tosatti |author3=M. Schuler |author4=S. Chessari |author5=M. Textor |author6=R.G. Richards |author7=L.G. Harris|title=Reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive RGD modified titanium surfaces: A first step toward cell selective surfaces|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A|date=Feb 2008|volume=84A|issue=2|pages=425–435|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbm.a.31323/full|accessdate=25 May 2011|doi=10.1002/jbm.a.31323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking this a step further, implantable devices can be coated with a [[Biological activity|bioactive]] material to encourage adsorption of specific proteins, fibrous capsule formation, and wound healing. This would reduce the risk of implant rejection and accelerate recovery by selecting for the necessary proteins and cells necessary for endothelialization. After the formation of the [[endothelium]], the body will no longer be exposed to the foreign material, and will stop the immune response.

Proteins such as [[collagen]] or [[fibrin]] often serve as scaffolds for cell adhesion and cell growth. This is an integral part to the structural integrity of cell sheets and their differentiation into more complex tissue and organ structures. The adhesion properties of proteins to non-biological surfaces greatly influences whether or not cells can indirectly attach to them via scaffolds. An implant like a hip-stem replacement necessitates integration with the host tissues, and protein adsorption facilitates this integration.

Surgical tools can be designed to be sterilized more easily so that proteins do not remain adsorbed to a surface, risking cross-contamination. Some diseases such as [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] (both related to [[mad cow disease]]) are caused by the transmission of [[prion]]s, which are errant or improperly folded forms of a normally native protein. Surgical tools contaminated with prions require a [[prion#Sterilization|special method of sterilization]] to completely eradicate all trace elements of the misfolded protein, as they are resistant to many of the normally used cleansing methods.

However, in some cases, protein adsorption to biomaterials can be an extremely unfavorable event. The adhesion of [[clotting factors]] may induce [[thrombosis]], which may lead to [[stroke]] or other blockages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorbet|first=MB|author2=MV Sefton |title=Biomaterial-associated thrombosis: roles of coagulation factors, complement, platelets, and leukocytes|journal=Biomaterials|date=Nov 2004|volume=25|issue=26|pages=5681–5703|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.023|pmid=15147815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some devices are intended to interact with the internal body environment such as sensors or drug-delivery vehicles, and protein adsorption would hinder their effectiveness.

==Fundamentals of Protein Adsorption==

[[Proteins]] are biomolecules that are composed of [[amino acid]] subunits. Each amino acid has a side chain that gains or loses charge depending on the pH of the surrounding environment, as well as its own individual polar/nonpolar qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purdue|title=Amino Acids|url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1biochem/amino2.html|work=The Amino Acids|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Amino acid titration.png|thumb|Amino acid titration]] Charged regions can greatly contribute to how that protein interacts with other molecules and surfaces, as well as its own tertiary structure (protein folding). As a result of their hydrophilicity, charged amino acids tend to be located on the outside of proteins, where they are able to interact with surfaces.&lt;ref name=Dee&gt;{{cite book|last=Dee|first=Kay C|title=An Introduction to Tissue-Biomaterial Interactions|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Cal Poly Kennedy Library|isbn=0-471-25394-4|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the unique combination of amino acids that gives a protein its properties. In terms of [[surface science|surface chemistry]], protein [[adsorption]] is a critical phenomenon that describes the aggregation of these molecules on the exterior of a material. The tendency for proteins to remain attached to a surface depends largely on the material properties such as surface energy, texture, and relative charge distribution. Larger proteins are more likely to adsorb and remain attached to a surface due to the higher number of contact sites between amino acids and the surface (Figure 1).[[File:Effect of protein size on interaction with a surface.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. The effect of protein size on interaction with a surface. Notice that the larger protein composed of more amino acids is capable of making more interactions]]

===Energy of Protein Adsorption===
The fundamental idea behind spontaneous protein adsorption is that adsorption occurs when more energy is released than gained according to Gibbs law of free energy.

This is seen in the equation:

::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{ads} G  = \Delta_{ads} H - {T} \Delta_{ads} S &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where: 
* ''∆&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;'' is net change of the parameters
* ''G'' is [[Gibbs free energy]]
* ''T'' is the [[temperature]] (SI unit: [[kelvin]])
* ''S'' is the [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin)
* ''H'' is the [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule)

In order for the protein adsorption to occur spontaneously, ''∆&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;G'' must be a negative number.

===Vroman Effect===
Proteins and other molecules are constantly in competition with one another over binding sites on a surface. The Vroman Effect, developed by Leo Vroman, postulates that small and abundant molecules will be the first to coat a surface. However, over time, molecules with higher affinity for that particular surface will replace them. This is often seen in materials that contact the blood where fibrin, which is usually abundant, will bind to the surface first and over time will be replaced by larger proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosengren|first=Asa|title=Cell-protein-material Interactions on Bioceramics and Model Surfaces|journal=Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations of the Faculty of Science and Technology|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate of Adsorption===
In order for proteins to adsorb, they must first come into contact with the surface through one or more of these major transport mechanisms: [[diffusion]], [[thermal convection]], [[bulk flow]], or a combination thereof. When considering the transport of proteins, it is clear how concentration gradients, temperature, protein size and flow velocity will influence the arrival of proteins to a solid surface. Under conditions of low flow and minimal temperature gradients, the adsorption rate can be modeled after the diffusion rate equation.&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt;

==== Diffusion Rate equation ====
::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; {dn \over dt} = C_o({D \over \pi t})^{1/2}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where: 
* ''D'' is the diffusion coefficient
* ''n'' is the surface concentration of protein
* ''Co'' is the bulk concentration of proteins
* ''t'' is time

A higher bulk concentration and/or higher diffusion coefficient (inversely proportional to molecular size) results in a larger number of molecules arriving at the surface. The consequential protein surface interactions result in high local concentrations of adsorbed protein, reaching concentrations of up to 1000 times higher than in the bulk solution.&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt; However, the body is much more complex, containing flow and convective diffusion, and these must be considered in the rate of protein adsorption.

==== Flow in a thin channel ====
::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; {\partial C \over \partial t} + V(y){\partial C \over \partial x} = D{\partial^2 C \over \partial y^2}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
and
::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; {V(y) = \gamma y(1- {y \over b})}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where:
* ''C'' is concentration
* ''D'' is the diffusion coefficient
* ''V'' is the velocity of flow
* ''x'' is the distance down the channel
* ''γ'' is the wall shear rate
* ''b'' is the height of the channel

This equation&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt;  is especially applicable to analyzing protein adsorption to biomedical devices in arteries, e.g. [[stents]].

==Forces and Interactions influencing protein adsorption==
The four fundamental classes of forces and interaction in protein adsorption are: 1) ionic or electrostatic interaction, 2) [[hydrogen bonding]], 3) [[hydrophobic]] interaction (largely entropically driven), and 4) interactions of charge-transfer or particle electron donor/acceptor type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=S|author2=H.B. Bull |title=Adsorbed films of bovine serum albumin|journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta|year=1966|volume=66|pages=150–157|doi=10.1016/0006-3002(63)91178-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionic or Electrostatic Interactions===
The charge of proteins is determined by the [[pKa]] of its [[amino acid]] side chains, and the terminal amino acid and carboxylic acid.  Proteins  with [[isoelectric point]] (pI) above physiological conditions have a positive charge and proteins with pI below physiological conditions have a negative charge.  The net charge of the protein, determined by the sum charge of its constituents, results in [[electrophoretic]] migration in a physiologic electric field.  These effects are short-range because of the high di-electric constant of water, however, once the protein is close to a charged surface, electrostatic coupling becomes the dominant force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrade|first=Joseph D.|title=Surface and interfacial Aspects of Biomedical Polymers|year=1985|publisher=Plenum|location=New York and London|isbn=0-306-41742-1|pages=10–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen Bonding===
Water has as much propensity to form hydrogen bonds as any group in a [[polypeptide]].  During a folding and association process, peptide and amino acid groups exchange hydrogen bonds with water.  Thus, hydrogen bonding does not have a strong stabilizing effect on protein adsorption in an aqueous medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=A.|title=Conformational Fluctuations and Change in Biological Macromolecules|journal=Scientific Progress|year=1980|volume=66|pages=473–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Hydrogen-bonding-in-water-2D.png|Illustration of two water molecules interacting to form a hydrogen bond&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Hydrophobic Interactions===
[[Hydrophobic]] interactions are essentially [[entropic]] interactions basically due to order/disorder phenomena in an aqueous medium.  The free energy associated with minimizing interfacial areas is responsible for minimizing the surface area of water droplets and air bubbles in water.  This same principle is the reason that hydrophobic amino acid side chains are oriented away from water, minimizing their interaction with water.  The [[hydrophilic]] groups on the outside of the molecule result in protein water solubility.  Characterizing this phenomenon can be done by treating these hydrophobic relationships with interfacial free energy concepts.  Accordingly, one can think of the driving force of these interactions as the minimization of total interfacial free energy, i.e. minimization of surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanford|first=C.|title=The Hydrophobic Effect|year=1981|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cartoon of protein hydrophobic interaction.jpg|thumb|Illustration of how protein changes shape to allow polar regions (blue) to interact with water while non-polar hydrophobic regions (red) do not interact with the water.]]

===Charge-Transfer Interactions===
Charge-transfer interactions are also important in protein stabilization and surface interaction.  In general donor-acceptor processes, one can think of excess electron density being present which can be donated to an electrophilic species.  In aqueous media, these solute interactions are primarily due to pi orbital electron effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porath|first=J.|title=Charge-transfer  Adsorption in Aqueous Media|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|year=1979|volume=51|pages=1549–1559|doi=10.1351/pac197951071549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors influencing protein adsorption==

===Temperature===
[[Temperature]] has an effect on both, the equilibrium state and kinetics of protein adsorption. The amount of protein adsorbed at high temperature is usually higher than that at room temperature. Temperature variation causes conformational changes in protein influencing adsorption. These conformational rearrangements in proteins results in an entropy gain which acts as a major driving force for protein adsorption. The temperature effect on protein adsorption can be seen in food manufacturing processes, especially liquid foods such as, milk which causes severe [[fouling]] on the wall surfaces of equipment where thermal treatment is carried out.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rabe|first=M.|title=Understanding protein adsorption at solid surfaces|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|year=2011|volume=162|pages=87–106|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2010.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=K.|title=On the adsorption of proteins on solid surfaces, a common but very complicated phenomenon|journal=Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering|year=2001|volume=91 | issue = 3 |pages=233–244|doi=10.1016/s1389-1723(01)80127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionic strength===
[[Ionic strength]] determines the [[Debye length]] that correlates with the damping distance of the electric potential of a fixed charge in an electrolyte. So, higher the ionic strength the shorter are electrostatic interactions between charged entities. As a result, the adsorption of charged proteins to oppositely charged substrates is hindered whereas the adsorption to like charged substrates is enhanced, thereby influencing adsorption kinetics. Also, high ionic strength increases the tendency of proteins to aggregate.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

===Multi-protein system===
When a surface is exposed to a multi-protein solution, adsorption of certain protein molecules are favored over the others. Protein molecules approaching the surface compete for binding sites.  In multi-protein system attraction between molecules can occur, whereas in single-protein solutions intermolecular repulsive interactions dominate. In addition, there is a time-dependent protein spreading, where protein molecules initially make contact with minimal binding sites on the surface. With the increase in protein's residence time on the surface, the protein may unfold for interaction with additional binding sites. This results in a time-dependent increase in the contact points between protein and surface. This further makes [[desorption]] less likely.&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt;

==Experimental approaches for studying protein adsorption==
===Solution depletion technique===
This technique measures a concentration change of proteins in bulk solution before and after [[adsorption]], Δc&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Any protein concentration change is attributed to the adsorbed layer, Γ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.

Γ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = Δc&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; V/A&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;

where:
*V = total volume of protein solution
*A&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = Total area available for [[adsorption]]
This method also requires a high surface area material such as particulate and beaded adsorbents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hlady|first=V.|title=Methods for Studying Protein Adsorption|journal=Methods Enzymol|year=1999|volume=309 |pages=402–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ellipsometry===
[[Ellipsometry]] has been used widely for measuring protein adsorption [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] as well as the structure of the adsorbed protein layer. It is an optical technique that measures the change of the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization of light]] after reflection from a surface. This technique requires planar, reflecting surfaces, preferably quartz, silicon or silica, and a strong change in [[refractive index]] upon protein adsorption.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

===Atomic-force microscopy===
[[Atomic-force microscopy]] (AFM) is a powerful [[microscopy]] technique used for studying samples at a nanoscale and is often used to image protein distribution on a surface. It consists of a [[cantilever]] with a tip to scan over the surface. It is a valuable tool for measuring protein-protein and protein-surface interaction. However, the limiting factor of many AFM studies is that imaging is often performed after drying the surface which might affect protein folding and the structure of the protein layer. Moreover, the cantilever tip can dislodge a protein or corrugate the protein layer.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lea|first=AS.|title=Manipulation of Proteins on Mica by Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=Langmuir|year=1992|volume=8 | issue = 1 |pages=68–73|doi=10.1021/la00037a015|pmc=4137798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface plasmon resonance===
[[Surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR) has been widely used for measuring protein adsorption with high sensitivity. This technique is based on the excitation of surface plasmons, longitudinal electromagnetic waves originated at the interface between metals and dielectrics. The deposition on the conducting surface of molecules and thin layers within 200&amp;nbsp;nm modifies the [[dielectric]] properties of the system and thus the SPR response, signaling the presence of molecules on a metal surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Servoli|first=E.|title=Comparative methods for the evaluation of protein adsorption|journal=Macromolecular Bioscience|year=2009|volume=9 | issue = 7 |pages=661–670|doi=10.1002/mabi.200800301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quartz crystal microbalance===
[[Quartz crystal microbalance]] (QCM) is an acoustic sensor built around a disk shaped [[quartz]] crystal. It makes use of the converse [[piezoelectric]] effect. QCM has been widely used for protein adsorption studies, especially, real time monitoring of label-free protein adsorption. In addition to the adsorption studies, QCM also provides information regarding elastic moduli, [[viscosity]], surface charge densities, protein conformational changes, net charge of biomolecules etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fulga|first=F.|author2=D.V.Nicolau|title=Biomolecular layers: Quantification of mass and thickness|journal=Wiley Encyclopedia of Biomedical Engineering|year=2006|doi=10.1002/9780471740360.ebs1351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy===
Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) is a device that relies on a thin-film optical waveguide, enclosing a discreet number of guided electromagnetic waves. Guidance is achieved by means of a grating coupler. It is based on the measurements of effective refractive index of a thin-film layer above the waveguide. This technique works only on highly transparent surfaces. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fulga|first=F.|author2=D.V.Nicolau|title=Biomolecular layers: Quantification of mass and thickness|journal=Wiley Encyclopedia of Biomedical Engineering|year=2006|doi=10.1002/9780471740360.ebs1351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods widely used for measuring the amount of protein adsorbed on surfaces include radio-labelling, [[Lowry assay]], scanning angle reflectometry, [[total internal reflection fluorescence]], [[bicinchoninic acid assay]] etc.

==Protein Adsorption to Metals==

===Chemical composition===
[[Metallic bond]]ing refers to the specific bonding between positive metal ions and surrounding valence electron clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kopeliovich|first=Dimitri|title=Metals Crystal Structure|url=http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=metals_crystal_structure|work=SubsTech|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intermolecular force is relatively strong, and gives rise to the repeated [[crystal]]line orientation of atoms, also referred to as its [[lattice system]]. There are several types of common lattice formations, and each has its own unique packing density and atomic closeness. The negatively charged electron clouds of the metal ions will sterically hinder the adhesion of negatively charged protein regions due to [[electric charge|charge repulsion]], thus limiting the available binding sites of a protein to a metal surface.

The lattice formation can lead to connection with exposed potential metal-ion-dependent adhesion sites (MIDAS)  which are binding sites for collagen and other proteins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasebj.org/content/23/8/2490.full The crystal structure of the signature domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein: implications for collagen, glycosaminoglycan and integrin binding]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the metal has different properties than the bulk since the normal crystalline repeating subunits is terminated at the surface. This leaves the surface atoms without a neighboring atom on one side, which inherently alters the electron distribution. This phenomenon also explains why the surface atoms have a higher energy than the bulk, often simply referred to as ''[[surface energy]]''. This state of higher energy is unfavorable, and the surface atoms will try to reduce it by binding to available reactive molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeda|first=Satoshi |author2=Makoto Fukawa |author3=Yasuo Hayashi |author4=Kiyoshi Matsumoto|title=Surface OH group governing adsorption properties of metal oxide films|journal=Thin Solid Films|date=8 Feb 1999|volume=339|issue=1–2|pages=220–224|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609098011523|accessdate=27 May 2011 | doi=10.1016/S0040-6090(98)01152-3 |bibcode = 1999TSF...339..220T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Fe4C.png|thumb|Notice in the diagram of Fe4C that the surface atoms are missing neighboring atoms.]] This is often accomplished by protein adsorption, where the surface atoms are reduced to a more advantageous energy state.

The internal environment of the body is often modeled to be an aqueous environment at 37&amp;nbsp;°C at pH 7.3 with plenty of dissolved oxygen, electrolytes, proteins, and cells.&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt;  When exposed to oxygen for an extended period of time, many metals may become [[redox|oxidized]] and increase their surface [[oxidation state]] by losing electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Over|first=H.|author2=Seitsonen |title=A.P.|journal=Science|date=20 September 2002|volume=297|series=5589|pages=2003–2005|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/297/5589/2003.full|accessdate=24 May 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1077063|issue=5589}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new [[cation]]ic state leaves the surface with a net positive charge, and a higher affinity for negatively charged protein side groups. Within the vast diversity of metals and metal alloys, many are susceptible to corrosion when implanted in the body. Elements that are more electronegative are corroded faster when exposed to an electrolyte-rich aqueous environment such as the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=Liping|author2=Guoning Yu |author3=Erlin Zhang |author4=Feng Pan |author5=Ke Yang |title=In vivo corrosion behavior of Mg-Mn-Zn alloy for bone implant application|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A|date=4 June 2007|volume=83A|issue=3|pages=703–711|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbm.a.31273/full|accessdate=25 May 2011|doi=10.1002/jbm.a.31273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both oxidation and corrosion will lower the free energy, thus affecting protein adsorption as seen in Eq. 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Joon Bu|title=Biomaterials Science and Engineering|year=1984|publisher=A Division of Plenum Publishing Corporation|location=Cal Poly Library|isbn=0-306-41689-1|pages=171–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of Topography===
Surface roughness and texture has an undeniable influence on protein adsorption on all materials, but with the ubiquity of metal machining processes, it is useful to address how these impact protein behavior. The initial adsorption is important, as well as maintained adhesion and integrity. Research has shown that surface roughness can encourage the adhesion of scaffold proteins and  osteoblasts, and results in an increase in surface mineralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deligianni|first=DD|author2=Katsala N |author3=Ladas S |author4=Sotiropoulou D |author5=Amedee J |author6=Missirlis YF |title=Effect of surface roughness of the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V on human bone marrow cell response and on protein adsorption.|journal=Biomaterials|year=2001|volume=22|pages=1241–1251|doi=10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00274-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surfaces with more topographical features and roughness will have more exposed surface area for proteins to interact with.&lt;ref name=Dee /&gt;  In terms of biomedical engineering applications, [[surface micromachining|micromachining]] techniques are often used to increase protein adhesion to implants in the hopes of shortening recovery time. The technique of laserpatterning introduces grooves and surface roughness that will influence adhesion, migration and alignment. Grit-blasting, a method analogous to sand blasting, and chemical etching have proven to be successful surface roughening techniques that promote the long-term stability of titanium implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hacking|first=SA|author2=Harvey EJ |author3=Tanzer M |author4=Krygier JJ |author5=Bobyn JD |title=Acid-etched microtexture for enhancement f bone growth into porous-coated implants|journal=J Bone Joint Surg|year=2003|volume=85B|pages=1182–1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in stability is a direct result of the observed increase in extracellular matrix and collagen attachment, which results in increased osteoblast attachment and mineralization when compared to non-roughened surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=SX|author2=L Salvati |author3=P Suh |title=How does silica grit-blasting affect Ti6Al4V alloy mineralization in a rat bone marrow cell culture system|journal=Medical Device Materials|date=23–25 September 2007|volume=IV|pages=182–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adsorption is not always desirable, however.  Machinery can be negatively affected by adsorption, particularly with [[Protein adsorption in the food industry]].

==Protein adsorption to polymers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Firkowska-Boden|first=I.|author2=Zhang, X.|author3=Jandt, Klaus. D.|title=Controlling Protein Adsorption through Nanostructured Polymeric Surfaces.|journal=Advanced Healthcare Materials|year=2017|pages=1700995|doi=10.1002/adhm.201700995}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[Polymer]]s are of great importance when considering protein adsorption in the biomedical arena. Polymers are composed of one or more types of "mers" bound together repeatedly, typically by directional covalent bonds. As the chain grows by the addition of mers, the chemical and physical properties of the material are dictated by the molecular structure of the monomer. By carefully selecting the type or types of mers in a polymer and its manufacturing process, the chemical and physical properties of a polymer can be highly tailored to adsorb specific proteins and cells for a particular application.

===Conformation effects===
Protein adsorption often results in significant conformational changes, which refers to changes in the [[Secondary protein|secondary]], [[Tertiary protein|tertiary]], and quartary structures of proteins.  In addition to adsorption rates and amounts, orientation and conformation are of critical importance.  These conformational changes can affect protein interaction with [[ligand]]s, [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]], and [[antigen]]s which are dependent on the orientation of the binding site of interest.  These conformational changes, as a result of protein adsorption, can also [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] the protein and change its native properties.[[File:Proteinadsorption.jpg|thumb|Illustration of protein (green) ligand (red star) binding site alteration by the conformational change of the protein as a result of surface (blue) adsorption.

===Adsorption to polymer scaffolds===
[[Tissue engineering]] is a relatively new field that utilizes a [[scaffolding]] as a platform upon which the desired cells proliferate.  It is not clear what defines an ideal scaffold for a specific tissue type.  The considerations are complex and protein adsorption only adds to the complexity.  Although architecture, structural mechanics, and surface properties play a key role, understanding degradation and rate of protein adsorption are also key.  In addition to the essentials of mechanics and geometry, a suitable scaffold construct will possess surface properties that are optimized for the attachment and migration of the cell types of particular interest.

Generally, it has been found that scaffolds that closely resemble the natural environments of the tissue being engineered are the most successful.  As a result, much research has gone into investigating natural polymers that can be tailored, through processing methodology, toward specific design criteria.  [[Chitosan]] is currently one of the most widely used polymers as it is very similar to naturally occurring [[glycosaminoglycan]] (GAGs) and it is degradable by human [[enzymes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drury|first=J.L.|author2=Mooney, D.J. |title=Hydrogels for tissue engineering: scaffold design variable and application.|journal=Biomaterials|year=2003|volume=24|issue=24|pages=4337–4351|doi=10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chitosan====
Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide containing linked chitin-derived residues and is widely studied as a biomaterial due to its high compatibility with numerous proteins in the body. Chitosan is cationic and thus electrostatically reacts with numerous [[proteoglycans]], anionic GAGs, and other molecules possessing a negative charge. Since many [[cytokines]] and growth factors are linked to GAG, scaffolds with the chitosan-GAG complexes are able to retain these proteins secreted by the adhered cells. Another quality of chitosan that gives it good biomaterial potential is its high charge density in solutions. This allows chitosan to form ionic complexes with many water-soluble anionic polymers, expanding the range of proteins that are able to bind to it and thus expanding its possible uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Blitterswijk|first=Clemens|title=Tissue Engineering|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein adsorption prediction==
Protein adsorption is critical for many industrial and biomedical applications and hence [[prediction]] of protein adsorption gets crucial.

===Biomolecular Adsorption Database===
Biomolecular Adsorption Database (BAD) is a freely available online database with experimental protein adsorption data collected from the literature.
The database can be used for the selection of materials for microfluidic device fabrication and for the selection of optimum operating conditions of [[lab-on-a-chip]] devices. The amount of protein adsorbed to the surface can be predicted using [[neural networks]]-based prediction available at BAD. This prediction has been validated to be below 5% error for the overall data available in the BAD. Other parameters, such as the thickness of protein layers and the [[surface tension]] of protein-covered surfaces, can also be estimated.[http://bad.molecularsense.com/]

[[Image:strass.jpg|thumb|Rhinestones on a [[tiara]]]]
[[File:Rowenta enamel rhinestone compact.jpg|thumb|Rowenta enamel rhinestone compact]]

A '''rhinestone''', '''paste''' or '''diamante''' is a [[diamond simulant]] originally made from [[rock crystal]] but since the 19th century from [[Lead_glass|crystal glass]] or polymers such as [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]].

== Original ==

Originally, rhinestones were rock crystals gathered from the river [[Rhine]], hence the name, although some were also found in areas like the [[Alps]], but today the name "rhinestone" applies only to varieties of lead glass known as [[crystal glass]]. The availability was greatly increased in the 18th century when the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[jeweller]] [[Georg Friedrich Strass]] had the idea to imitate diamonds by coating the lower side of lead glass with metal powder. Hence, rhinestones are called ''strass'' in many [[Languages of Europe|European languages]].

As opposed to the classic rhinestones, which had a metal powder coating on the bottom side only, several companies have opted to mass-produce iridescent lead glass, by reducing the metal coating thickness and apply it uniformly, not using metal powder with a binder but by applying various forms of metal deposition (thin foil, vapor deposition, etc): [[Favrile glass]] by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] in 1894, [[Carnival glass]] under the name "Iridrill" by [[Fenton Art Glass Company|Fenton]] in 1908, "Aurora Borealis" glass by [[Swarovski]] in 1956 and [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD-coated]] [[dichroic glass]] in the late 20th century, amongst many other decorative lead glasses coated with a thin metal layer sold under various commercial names such as "rainbow glass", "aurora glass" and such.

Rhinestones can be used as imitations of diamonds, and some manufacturers even manage to partially reproduce the glistening effect real diamonds have in the sun.

== Compositions ==

Typically, crystal rhinestones have been used on [[costumes]], apparel and [[jewelry]]. Crystal rhinestones are produced mainly in [[Austria]] by [[Swarovski]] and in [[Czech Republic|the Czech Republic]] by [[Preciosa (corporation)|Preciosa]] and a few other glassworks in northern Bohemia. In the US, these are sometimes called "Austrian crystal".

The rhinestone-studded Nudie suit was invented by [[Nudie Cohn]] in the 1940s, an Americanization of the [[matador]]'s "[[Traje de luces|suit of lights]]". Rhinestone material is often used as an alternative to [[sequin]].

== In popular culture ==

Liberal use of rhinestones was associated with [[country music]] [[singer]]s, as well as with singer [[Elvis Presley]] and pianist [[Liberace]]. In 1974 [[David Allan Coe]] released the album ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'' and referred to himself as The Rhinestone Cowboy again in the 1977 song "Longhaired Redneck". In 1975 [[Glen Campbell]] had a top hit with the song "[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]" and became known as the "Rhinestone Cowboy".  That song served as the basis for the 1984 movie ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. [[Gorillaz]] has also released a single by the name of "[[Rhinestone Eyes]]". The closing track on Madvillain's Madvillainy is called Rhinestone Cowboy.

==Sizing guide==
Rhinestones are sized by using the term "ss", or stone size, followed by a number to indicate size (e.g. 8ss is equivalent to 2.3&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, 10ss is 2.8&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothingdictionary.com/rhinestones_and_rhinestone_jewelry.htm |title=Rhinestones and Rhinestone Jewelry |publisher=Clothingdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SS is more commonly used for apparel means, while PP (or pearl plate) is used for jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewelrymaking-beads-library.com/rhinestone-size.html |title=Rhinestone Size - SS Size and PP size |publisher=Jewelrymaking-beads-library.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot-fix rhinestones==
Hot-fix rhinestones, also called heat-transfer rhinestones, are mainly used for apparel. The flat bottom of the stone has a glue backing and, when heated, melts onto the surface of the clothing. These can be adhered using a regular iron, however, it is recommended to use a [[heat press]], as they are able to reach higher temperatures (standard transfers require temperatures of up to {{convert|350|-|400|F|C|disp=flip|sigfig=2}}) while applying heavy pressures resulting in a more professional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.swarovski-professional.com/en-WORLD/application/hotfix-application |title= Swarovski Hotfix Applikation |publisher=[[Swarovski|Swarovski]] |date= |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Santa Fe Institute (SFI)''' is an independent, nonprofit theoretical research institute located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] ([[New Mexico]], [[United States]]) and dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of the fundamental principles of [[complex adaptive system]]s, including physical, computational, biological, and social systems. As of 2016, the Institute is ranked 20th among the world's "Top Science and Technology Think Tanks" and 23rd among the world's "Best Transdisciplinary Research Think Tanks" according to the ''Global Think Tank Report'' published annually by the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGann|first1=James G.|title=2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report|journal=TTCSP Global Go To Think Tank Index Reports|date=2017|volume=12|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute consists of a small number of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large group of external faculty whose primary appointments are at other institutions, and a number of visiting scholars. The Institute is advised by a group of eminent scholars, including several Nobel Prize–winning scientists. Although theoretical scientific research is the Institute's primary focus, it also runs several popular summer schools on complex systems, along with other educational and outreach programs aimed at students ranging from middle school up through graduate school.

The Institute's annual funding comes from a combination of private donors, grant-making foundations, government science agencies, and companies affiliated with its business network. The 2014 budget was just over $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafe.edu/about/governance/annual-report/ |title=2014 Annual Report |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theorist [[David Krakauer (scientist)|David Krakauer]] became the Institute's president on August 1, 2015.

== History ==
The Santa Fe Institute was founded in 1984 by scientists [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], [[Herbert L. Anderson|Herb Anderson]], [[Peter A. Carruthers]], and [[Richard Slansky]]. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. In conceiving of the Institute, the scientists sought a forum to conduct theoretical research outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries of academic departments and government agency science budgets.&lt;ref name=Waldrop&gt;{{cite book | author = Mitchell M. Waldrop | year = 1993 | title = Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | url =https://books.google.com/books/about/Complexity.html?id=JTRJxYK_tZsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite book | author = George A. Cowan | year = 2010 | title = Manhattan Project to the Santa Fe Institute: The Memoirs of George A. Cowan | publisher = University of New Mexico Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a new [[interdisciplinary]] research area called [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] or simply [[complex system]]s. This new effort was intended to provide an alternative to the increasing specialization the founders observed in science by focusing on synthesis across disciplines.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of the Santa Fe Institute: Institutional and Individual Qualities of Expert Interdisciplinary Work |first=Dan |last=Dillon |url=http://thegoodproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GoodWork22.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the idea of interdisciplinary science increased in popularity, a [[Complex systems#Research centers, conferences, and journals|number of independent institutes and departments]] emerged whose focus emphasized similar goals.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;

The Santa Fe Institute was created to be a visiting institution, with no permanent or tenured positions, a small group of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large visitors program, and a larger group of external faculty affiliated with the Institute but located at other institutions. The motivation of this structure was to encourage active turnover in ideas and people, allowing the research to remain on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt; Today, the Santa Fe Institute continues to follow this organizational model.

== Organization ==
The Institute is composed of several distinct groups. The resident faculty are researchers whose primary appointment is at the Institute. Along with the Omidyar Fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/programhub.asp?sort=PDC-SantaFeInstitute-OmidyarFellowship |title=Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellowship – Program Info |publisher=Pathways to Science |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of postdoctoral scholars in residence, the resident faculty makes up the majority of the researchers physically present at the Institute. The external faculty is a group of roughly 100 affiliated researchers whose primary appointments are at other institutions, typically universities. These individuals form a large and distributed community of scholars who frequently visit the Institute and contribute to its overall research program. The Institute's Business Network is a group of private companies and government agencies interested in complex systems research. Members of the business network often send representatives to Institute meetings or to serve as research fellows in residence at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Santa Fe Institute Business Network |url=http://www.santafe.edu/network/ |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business Network Members |url=http://www.santafe.edu/network/members/ |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's Science Board is a large group of eminent scholars who advise the Institute on important strategic matters. This group includes a number of Nobel Prize winners.&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

The Institute is headed by a president, currently evolutionary theorist David Krakauer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/new-sfi-president-sees-unique-opportunities-at-institute/article_80018249-4ae4-54fc-b9d4-0823a8e477a5.html |title=New SFI president sees new opportunities |publisher=Santa Fe New Mexican |accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Vice President for Science, currently network ecologist Jennifer Dunne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/356/35663/ |title=The Morrison Institute Winter Colloquium presents Professor Jennifer Dunne of the Santa Fe Institute, "Structural and Dynamical Roles of Human Hunter-Gatherers in Northwest Pacific Marine Food Webs" |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is governed by a Board of Trustees, which is chaired by [[Michael Mauboussin]] of [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladailypost.com/content/santa-fe-institute-elects-new-chair |title=Santa Fe Institute Elects New Chair |publisher=Los Alamos Daily Post |date=2012-11-24 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Research at the Institute focuses on systems commonly described as [[complex adaptive system]]s or simply [[complex system]]s. Recent research has included studies of [[evolutionary computation]], metabolic and ecological scaling laws, the fundamental properties of cities, the evolutionary diversification of viral strains, the interactions and conflicts of primate social groups, the history of languages, the structure and dynamics of species interactions including food webs, the dynamics of financial markets, and the emergence of hierarchy and cooperation in the human species, and biological and technological innovation.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

Historically, researchers affiliated with the Institute played roles to varying degrees in the development and use of methods for studying [[complex system]]s, including [[agent-based model]]ing, [[network theory]], [[computational immunology]], the [[physics of financial markets]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, the physics of computation, and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;

The Institute also studies foundational topics in the physics and mathematics of complex systems, using tools from related disciplines such as [[information theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[computational complexity theory]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. Recent research in this area has included studies of phase transitions in [[NP-hard]] problems.

Some of the Institute's accomplishments include:

== Educational programs ==
The Santa Fe Institute runs a number of education programs aimed at introducing students as young as middle school and as old as graduate school to the core ideas of complex systems. The longest running education program is the annual Complex Systems Summer School, held annually for 30 years in Santa Fe at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]]. The CSSS hosts 50-60 graduate students and early postdocs, along with select Business Network fellows, for four week course on complex systems. Lectures are provided by Institute researchers, and students work on a small collaborative project on complex systems.&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

The Institute also awards an annual High School Prize for Scientific Excellence to a local high school student and a local teacher.

The educational programs include:
* Complex Systems Summer School (graduate and postdoctoral level)&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complex Systems Summer School|url=http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/|publisher=Santa Fe Institute|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism''''' was an exhibition curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48720&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, through bringing about a hundred works each of four modern Indian artists, namely [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] on the centre stage, put the Santiniketan art movement into focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1418/14180690.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar argues that the "Santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style, and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique. Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual modernism==
The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition "Place for People"—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian Kumar’s exhibition and related publication, ''A Contextual Modernism'', focused on the [[Santiniketan]] artists [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. Of the Santiniketan artists, Kumar observed that they "reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kumar "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual modernism and the Bengal School of Art==
{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kumar had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 1980s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was misleading. According to Kumar, "this happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiniketan: art movement and school==
{{History of art sidebar}}
Kumar draws distinction between ''Santiniketan the art movement'' and ''Santiniketan the School'':

{{Quotation| I am not sure, however, if everyone noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan as an art movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position and the other a modernist position. I am not suggesting that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.|''ALL THE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF THE LIVED WORLD &lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The shared perspectives==
{{Quotation|The brief survey of the individual works of the core Santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but by a community of ideas. Which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward. Thus they do not represent a school but a movement.|''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism, 1997}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="818">'''Semantic audio''' is the extraction of symbols or meaning from an audio stream. [[Speech recognition]] is an important semantic audio application. But for speech, other semantic operations include language, speaker or gender identification. For more general audio or music, it includes identifying a piece of music (e.g. [[Shazam (service)]]) or a movie soundtrack.

Areas of research in semantic audio include the ability to label an audio waveform with where the harmonies change and what they are and where material is repeated and what instruments are playing.

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Music/|title=Ancient Greek Music|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include [[vocal coaches]], [[choral music|choral directors]], [[Music education|vocal music educators]], [[List of opera directors|opera directors]], and other teachers of singing.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000). "The progressively changing songs of humpback whales: a window on the creative process in a wild animal." In The Origins of Music. Edited by N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 135–150. Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Graduate Research Grants===
'''Graduate Research Grants''' are designed to the support students working toward the completion of a Master's Theses or Doctoral Dissertation within the traditional Humanities disciplines. Grants may also be awarded to students studying outside the traditional Humanities if their research is clearly grounded in the Humanities. Winners are awarded up to $1000. Applicants are accepted twice an academic year, once during the Spring, and once during the Fall. The primary criteria by which the board evaluates applications include: "the significance of the project to knowledge in the specific field, the significance of the project to knowledge of the humanities in general, the quality of the project, including its originality, independence, initiative, and clarity, the feasibility of the proposal and the likelihood of timely completion of the project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Research Grants|url=http://web.uri.edu/humanities/graduate_research/|website=www.uri.edu|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Excellence Awards===
As part of the annual Humanities Festival each Spring, the Center for Humanities acknowledges two students who have demonstrated excellence in Humanities related study throughout their academic careers at the University of Rhode Island. Students are nominated by faculty members who recognize the high quality of the student’s academic rigor and passion for the Humanities. Such excellence can be interpreted in terms of high grade point average in Humanities courses, an exceptional research or artistic prevention, the student’s professional promise in a Humanities related career, or any combination thereof. Winners are awarded $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Awards for Excellence in the Humanities|url=http://web.uri.edu/humanities/student-awards-for-excellence-in-the-humanities/|website=www.uri.edu|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] with the Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) and the types of telescopes used to image parts of the spectrum.]]'''Visible-light astronomy''' encompasses a wide variety of [[observation]]s via [[telescope]]s that are sensitive in the range of [[visible light]] ([[optical telescope]]s). Visible-light astronomy is part of optical astronomy, and differs from astronomies based on invisible types of light in the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation spectrum]], such as [[Radio astronomy|radio waves]], [[Infrared astronomy|infrared waves]], [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet waves]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray waves]] and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray waves]]. Visible light ranges from 380 to 750 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in [[wavelength]]. 

Visible-light astronomy has existed as long as people have been looking up at the night sky, although it has since improved in its observational capabilities since the invention of the telescope, which is commonly credited to [[Hans Lippershey]], a German-Dutch spectacle-maker,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Hans+Lippershey+inventor+of+the+telescope.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uJKiTJvkIsP6lweQ4dHbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Hans%20Lippershey%20inventor%20of%20the%20telescope.&amp;f=false|title=The History of the Telescope|last=King|first=Henry C.|date=2003|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486432656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Galileo played a large role in the development and creation of telescopes. Visible-light astronomy continues to advance in the modern day, with projects such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]] being projected for launch in the next few years. 

Since visible-light astronomy is restricted to only visible light, no equipment is necessary for simply [[Amateur astronomy|star gazing]]. This means that it's the most commonly participated in type of astronomy, as well as the oldest.  

==History==
===Beginning===
{{Main|Galileo Galilei}}Before the advent of telescopes, astronomy was limited solely to unaided eyesight. Humans have been looking at stars and objects in the night sky for thousands of years, as is evident in the naming of many constellations, notably the largely Greek names used today. [[File:Bertini fresco of Galileo Galilei and Doge of Venice.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco by [[Giuseppe Bertini]] depicting Galileo showing the [[Doge of Venice]] how to use the telescope]]

[[Hans Lippershey]], a German-Dutch spectacle-maker, is commonly credited as being the first to invent the [[telescope]]. [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] is the first recorded person to apply for a patent for a telescope,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however it is unclear if [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] was the first to build a telescope. Based only on uncertain descriptions of the [[telescope]] which [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent for, Galileo made a telescope with about 3x magnification in the following year. Galileo later made improved versions with up to 30x magnification.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} With a [[Refracting telescope#Galileo's telescope|Galilean telescope]] the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. Galileo could also use it to observe the sky, and for a time was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, Galileo demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of up to 8 or 9, to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. Galileo's telescopes were also a profitable sideline; selling them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 1–2])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern day ===
In the modern day, visible-light astronomy is still practiced by many [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]], especially since [[Telescope|telescopes]] are much more widely available for the public, as compared to when they were first being invented. Government agencies, such as [[NASA]], are very involved in the modern day research and observation of visible objects and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. In the modern day, the highest quality pictures and data are obtained via [[Space telescope|space telescopes]]; [[Telescope|telescopes]] that are outside of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. This allows for much clearer observations, as the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] is not disrupting the image and [[Astronomical seeing|viewing quality]] of the telescope, meaning objects can be observed in much greater detail, and much more distant or low-light objects may be observed. Additionally, this means that observations are able to be made at any time, rather than only during the night.

==== Hubble Space Telescope ====
{{Main|Hubble Space Telescope}}
The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is a [[space telescope]] created by [[NASA]], and was launched into [[low Earth orbit]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html|title=NASA - NASA's Great Observatories|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=http://teachspacescience.org/graphics/pdf/10000870.pdf, http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/, http://chandra.harvard.edu/, http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in operation today. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s four main instruments observe in the [[Ultraviolet|near ultraviolet]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[Infrared|near infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]]. Hubble's images are some of the most detailed images ever taken, leading to many breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as accurately determining the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

==== James Webb Space Telescope ====
{{Main|James Webb Space Telescope}}
The James Webb Space Telescope is the formal successor of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webbtelescope.org/webb_telescope/webb_past_and_future/|title=James Webb Telescope -|website=webbtelescope.org|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set to launch in March 30, 2021,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwst.nasa.gov/news_archive.html|title=News JWST/NASA|website=jwst.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is "one of the most ambitious and technically complex missions NASA has ever set its focus upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasas-most-technically-complex-space-observatory-requires-precision|title=James Webb Space Telescope (WEBB/JWST) NASA|last=|first=|date=|website=jwst.nasa.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Webb Space Telescope is a space-based telescope, and is set to orbit near the second [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange point]] of the Earth-Sun system, 1,500,000 kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwst.stsci.edu/|title=STScI {{!}} James Webb Telescope (JWST)|website=jwst.stsci.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optical telescopes ==
{{Main|Optical telescope}}
There are three main types of telescopes used in visible-light astronomy:

*[[Refracting telescope|Refracting telescopes]], which use lenses to form the image. Commonly used by amateur astronomers, especially for viewing brighter objects such as the [[Moon]], and [[Planet|planets]], due to lower cost and ease of usage.
*[[Reflecting telescope|Reflecting telescopes]], which use mirrors to form the image. Commonly used for scientific purposes.
*[[Catadioptric Telescope|Catadioptric telescopes]], which use a combination of lenses and mirrors to form the image; essentially a combination of [[Refracting telescope|refracting]] and [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescopes.

Each type of telescope suffers from different types of [[Optical aberration|aberration]]; [[Refracting telescope|refracting telescopes]] have [[chromatic aberration]], which causes colors to be shown on edges separating light and dark parts of the image, where there should not be such colors. This is due to the lens being unable to focus all colors to the same convergence point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marimont|first=David H.|last2=Wandell|first2=Brian A.|date=1994-12-01|title=Matching color images: the effects of axial chromatic aberration|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-11-12-3113|journal=JOSA A|language=EN|volume=11|issue=12|pages=3113–3122|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.11.003113|issn=1520-8532}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reflecting telescope|Reflecting telescopes]] suffer from several types of optical inaccuracies, such as off-axis aberrations near the edges of the field of view. Catadioptric telescopes vary in the types of optical inaccuracies present, as there are numerous catadioptric telescope designs. 

==Effect of ambient brightness==
[[File:Light_pollution_europe.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Light_pollution_europe.jpg|thumb|Light pollution map of Europe]]The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution, with the presence of the [[Moon]] in the night sky historically hindering astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, [[light pollution]] has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas. In order to avoid light pollution of Earth's sky, among other reasons, many telescopes are put outside of the Earth's atmosphere, where not only light pollution, but also atmospheric distortion and obscuration are minimized. 

== Commonly observed objects ==
The most commonly observed objects tend to be ones that do not require a telescope to view, such as the [[Moon]], [[Meteoroid|meteors]], [[Planet|planets]], [[Constellation|constellations]], and [[Star|stars]].

The [[Moon]] is a very commonly observed astronomical object, especially by [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] and [[Skygazing|skygazers]]. This is due to several reasons: the Moon is the brightest object in the night sky, the Moon is the largest object in the night sky, and the Moon has long been significant in many cultures, such as being the basis for many calendars. The Moon also does not require any kind of telescope or binoculars to see effectively, making it extremely convenient and common for people to observe.

[[Meteoroid|Meteors]], often called "shooting stars" are also commonly observed. [[Meteor shower|Meteor showers]], such as the [[Perseids]] and [[Leonids]], make viewing meteors much easier, as a multitude of meteors are visible in a relatively short period of time.

[[Planet|Planets]] are usually observed with the aid of a telescope or binoculars. [[Venus]] is likely the easiest planet to observe without the aid of any instruments, as it is very bright, and can even be seen in daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995JBAA..105..311E|title=1995JBAA..105..311E Page 311|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]] can also be seen without the aid of telescopes or binoculars.

[[Constellation|Constellations]] and [[Star|stars]] are also often observed, and have been used in the past for navigation, especially by ships at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/navigating-at-sea/navigating-without-a-clock/celestial-navigation|title=Celestial Navigation {{!}} Time and Navigation|website=timeandnavigation.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recognizable constellations is the [[Big Dipper]], which is part of the constellation [[Ursa Major]]. Constellations also serve to help describe the location of other objects in the sky.
