'''Western Esotericism''' is an [[academic field]] of [[research]], [[scholarship]], and [[education]] that focuses on the history of [[Europe]]an and [[Western esotericism]].

==Origins and development==
The academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that &amp;ndash; although it had been ignored by previous scholarship &amp;ndash; the impact which pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought had exerted on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=4}} One of the key centres for this was the [[Warburg Institute]] in London, where scholars like [[Frances Yates]], [[Edgar Wind]], Ernst Cassier, and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater impact on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|pp=4–5}} In 1965, the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] in the [[Sorbonne]], Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was [[François Secret]], a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} In 1979 the scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the "History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=x}} Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=5}}

Faivre noted that there were two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was that there was an engrained prejudice towards esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} The second was that esotericism is a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it "participates in all these fields" it does not squarely fit into any of them.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|pp=1–2}} 

In 1980, the U.S.-based [[Hermetic Academy]] was founded by [[Robert A. McDermott]] as an outlet for scholars interested in Western esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]] under the rubric of the "Esotericism and Perennialism Group".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented the fact that it had not done so in Germany.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}}
By 2008, there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, at the [[University of Sorbonne]], [[University of Amsterdam]], and the [[University of Exeter]], with the latter two institutions also offering [[master's degree]] programs in it.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=3}}

On the basis of the fact that "English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism", in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that [[English studies]] also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.{{sfn|Brînzeu|Szönyi|2011|p=184}}

==Schools==
The following Universities have academic chairs in the subject:
* [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands
* [[École pratique des hautes études]] in France

Specific degrees that can be granted include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15074">'''Advanced oxidation processes''' (abbreviation: '''AOPs'''), in a broad sense, are a set of chemical treatment procedures designed to remove organic (and sometimes inorganic) materials in [[water]] and [[wastewater]] by [[oxidation]] through reactions with [[hydroxyl radicals]] (·OH).&lt;ref name="glaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glaze|first=William|author2=Kang, Joon-Wun|author3= Chapin, Douglas H.|title=The Chemistry of Water Treatment Processes Involving Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide and Ultraviolet Radiation.|journal=Ozone: Science &amp; Engineering |year=1987|volume=9|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1080/01919518708552148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world applications of [[wastewater treatment]], however, this term usually refers more specifically to a subset of such chemical processes that employ [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and/or UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Water Research Institute|title=Treatment Technologies for Removal of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) from Drinking Water: Chapter III Advanced Oxidation Processes|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such type of process is  called [[in situ oxidation|in situ chemical oxidation]].

==Description==
AOPs rely on in-situ production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH). These reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and can virtually oxidize any compound present in the water matrix, often at a diffusion controlled reaction speed. Consequently, ·OH reacts unselectively once formed and contaminants will be quickly and efficiently fragmented and converted into small inorganic molecules. Hydroxyl radicals are produced with the help of one or more primary oxidants (e.g. [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[oxygen]]) and/or energy sources (e.g. [[ultraviolet]] light) or catalysts (e.g. [[titanium dioxide]]). Precise, pre-programmed dosages, sequences and combinations of these reagents are applied in order to obtain a maximum •OH yield. In general, when applied in properly tuned conditions, AOPs can reduce the concentration of contaminants from several-hundreds [[Parts per million|ppm]] to less than 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and therefore significantly bring [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Total organic carbon|TOC]] down, which earned it the credit of “water treatment processes of the 21st century”.&lt;ref name="munter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munter|first=Rein|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes–Current Status and Prospects.|journal=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Chemistry|year=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOP procedure is particularly useful for cleaning biologically toxic or non-degradable materials such as [[aromatics]], [[pesticides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Misra|first=N.N.|title=The contribution of non-thermal and advanced oxidation technologies towards dissipation of pesticide residues|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=2|pages=229–244|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2015.06.005|year=2015|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=schfsehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[petroleum]] constituents, and [[volatile organic compound]]s in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Enric Brillasa |author2=Eva Mur |author3=Roser Sauleda |author4=Laura Sànchez |author5=José Peral |author6=Xavier Domènech |author7=Juan Casado |title=Aniline mineralization by AOP's: anodic oxidation, photocatalysis, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |date=March 1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1016/S0926-3373(97)00059-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TF6-3VN03K2-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d557b71411fdce56af991813ef191bf7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, AOPs can be used to treat effluent of secondary treated wastewater which is then called [[tertiary treatment]].&lt;ref name="audenaert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.T.M. Audenaert |author2=Y. Vermeersch |author3=S.W.H. Van Hulle |author4=P. Dejans |author5=A. Dumouilin |author6=I.

A goal of the wastewater purification by means of AOP procedures is the reduction of the chemical contaminants and the toxicity to such an extent that the cleaned wastewater may be reintroduced into receiving streams or, at least, into a conventional [[sewage treatment]].

Although oxidation processes involving ·OH have been in use since late 19th century (such as in Fenton reagent, which, however, was an analytical reagent at that time), the utilization of such oxidative species in water treatment did not receive adequate attention until Glaze et al.&lt;ref name="glaze"/&gt;  suggested the possible generation of ·OH “in sufficient quantity to affect water purification” and defined the term “Advanced Oxidation Processes” for the first time in 1987. AOPs still have not been put into commercial use on a large scale (especially in developing countries) even up to today mostly because of the relatively high costs. Nevertheless, its high oxidative capability and efficiency make AOPs a popular technique in tertiary treatment in which the most recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants are to be eliminated. The increasing interest in water reuse and more stringent regulations regarding water pollution are currently accelerating the implementation of AOPs at full-scale.
There are roughly 500 commercialized AOPs installations around the world at present, mostly in [[Europe]] and [[the United States]]. Other countries like [[China]] are showing increasing interests in AOPs.

==Chemical principles==
Generally speaking, chemistry in AOPs could be essentially divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazille |first=Félicien |title=Advanced Oxidation Processes {{!}} SSWM. Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management |url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528100827/http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Formation of ·OH;
# Initial attacks on target molecules by ·OH and their breakdown to fragments;
# Subsequent attacks by ·OH until ultimate [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].
The mechanism of ·OH production (Part 1) highly depends on the sort of AOP technique that is used. For example, ozonation, UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and photocatalytic oxidation rely on different mechanisms of ·OH generation:
*UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="audenaert" /&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → 2·OH ''(homolytic bond cleavage of the O-O bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to formation of 2·OH radicals)''

:HO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;· → ·OH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''
*Photocatalytic oxidation with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="beltran" /&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(irradiation of the photocatalytic surface leads to an excited [[electron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and electron gap (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)''
:Ti(IV) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(water adsorbs onto the catalyst surface)''
:Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}}  Ti(IV)-·OH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''the highly reactive electron gap will react with water''
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''

Currently there is no consensus on the detailed mechanisms in Part 3, but researchers have cast light on the processes of initial attacks in Part 2. In essence, ·OH is a radical species and should behave like a highly reactive electrophile. Thus two type of initial attacks are supposed to be [[Hydrogen Abstraction]] and [[Addition reaction|Addition]]. The following scheme, adopted from a technical handbook and later refined, describes a possible mechanism of the oxidation of [[benzene]] by ·OH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solarchem Environmental System|title=The UV/Oxidation Handbook|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Mechanism of OH with benzene.png|800px|Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals]]

''Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals''

The first and second steps are electrophilic addition that breaks the aromatic ring in benzene (A) and forms two hydroxyl groups (–OH) in intermediate C. Later an ·OH grabs a hydrogen atom in one of the hydroxyl groups, producing a radical species (D) that is prone to undergo rearrangement to form a more stable radical (E). E, on the other hand, is readily attacked by ·OH and eventually forms 2,4-hexadiene-1,6-dione (F).
As long as there are sufficient ·OH radicals, subsequent attacks on compound F will continue until the fragments are all converted into small and stable molecules like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the end, but such processes may still be subject to a myriad of possible and partially unknown mechanisms.

==Advantages==
AOPs hold several advantages that are unparalleled in the field of water treatment:
*They can effectively eliminate organic compounds in aqueous phase, rather than collecting or transferring pollutants into another phase.
*Due to the remarkable reactivity of ·OH, it virtually reacts with almost every aqueous pollutant without discriminating. AOPs are therefore applicable in many, if not all, scenarios where many organic contaminants must be removed at the same time.
*Some [[heavy metals]] can also be removed in forms of precipitated M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.
*In some AOPs designs, [[disinfection]] can also be achieved, which makes these AOPs an integrated solution to some water quality problems.
*Since the complete reduction product of ·OH is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, AOPs theoretically do not introduce any new hazardous substances into the water.

==Current shortcomings==
It should be realised that AOPs are not perfect and have several drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes|url=http://neopuretech.com/advanced-oxidation-processes/|publisher=Neopure Technologies|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most prominently, the cost of AOPs is fairly high, since a continuous input of expensive chemical reagents is required to maintain the operation of most AOP systems. As a result of their very nature, AOPs require hydroxyl radicals and other reagents proportional to the quantity of contaminants to be removed.
*Some techniques require pre-treatment of wastewater to ensure reliable performance, which could be potentially costly and technically demanding. For instance, presence of [[bicarbonate]] ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can appreciably reduce the concentration of ·OH due to [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging processes]] that yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a much less reactive species, ·CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="munter"/&gt; As a result, bicarbonate must be wiped out from the system or AOPs are compromised.
*It is not cost effective to use solely AOPs to handle a large amount of wastewater; instead, AOPs should be deployed in the final stage after [[primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] have successfully removed a large proportion of contaminants.

==Future ==
Since AOPs were first defined in 1987, the field has witnessed a rapid development both in theory and in application. So far, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, and Fenton, photo-Fenton and Electro-Fenton systems have received extensive scrutiny. However, there are still many research needs on these existing AOPs.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

Recent trends are the development of new, modified AOPs that are efficient and economical. In fact, there has been some studies that offer constructive solutions. For instance, [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with non-metallic elements could possibly enhance the [[photocatalytic]] activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Tracy L|author2=Yates, John T|title=Surface science studies of the photoactivation of TiO2–new photochemical processes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2006|volume=106|issue=10|pages=4428–4453|doi=10.1021/cr050172k|pmid=17031993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementation of ultrasonic treatment could promote the production of hydroxyl radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berberidou|first=C|author2=Poulios I.|author3= Xekoukoulotakis, N.

'''Alejo Carpentier y Valmont''' (December 26, 1904 – April 24, 1980) was a [[Cuba]]n novelist, essayist, and [[musicologist]] who greatly influenced [[Latin American literature]] during its famous [[Latin American Boom|"boom" period]]. Born in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], and despite his European birthplace, he  strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as [[Fidel Castro]]'s Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies.

With a developed knowledge of music, Carpentier explored musicology, publishing an in-depth study of the [[music of Cuba]], ''La música en Cuba'' and integrated musical themes and literary techniques throughout his works. He explored elements of [[Afro-Cuban]]ism and incorporated the cultural aspects into the majority of his writings. Although Carpentier wrote in a myriad of genres, such as journalism, radio drama, playwrighting, academic essays, opera and libretto, he is best known for his novels. He was among the first practitioners of [[magical realism]] using the technique, ''lo real maravilloso'' to explore the fantastic quality of Latin American history and culture. The most famous example of Afro-Cuban influence and use of ''lo real maravilloso'' is Carpentier's 1949 novel ''[[El reino de este mundo]]'' (''[[The Kingdom of this World]]'') about the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century.

Carpentier's writing style integrated the resurgent [[Baroque]] style, or ''New World Baroque'' style that Latin American artists adopted from the European model and assimilated to the Latin American artistic vision. With a first-hand experience of the French Surrealist movement, Carpentier also adapted the [[Surrealist]] theory to Latin American literature. Always eager to explore more than Cuban identity, Carpentier used his traveling experiences throughout Europe and Latin American to expand his understanding of Latin American identity. Carpentier wove elements of Latin American political history, music, social injustice and art into the tapestries of his writings, all of which  exerted a decisive influence on the works of younger Latin American and Cuban writers like [[Lisandro Otero]], [[Leonardo Padura]] and Fernando Velázquez Medina.

Carpentier died in Paris in 1980 and was buried in Havana's [[Colon Cemetery]] with other Cuban political and artistic luminaries.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Carpentier was born on December 26, 1904, in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, to Jorge Julián Carpentier, a French architect, and Lina Valmont, a Russian language teacher.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Belnap|1993|pp= 263–264, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time it was believed that he was born in [[Havana]], where his family moved immediately after his birth; however, following Carpentier's death, his birth certificate was found in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Belnap|1993|pp= 263–264, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Alejo and his family moved from [[Cuba]] to Paris. He also spoke French and as an adolescent, he read Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"/&gt; In 1921, Carpentier attended the School of Architecture of the University of Havana. When he was 18, his parents' marriage broke up and his father left. The following year, Carpentier left his studies and tried to find work to support his mother.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"/&gt; He turned to journalism, working for the Cuban newspapers ''Carteles'' and ''Social''. He also studied music.&lt;ref name="Colchie"&gt;Colchie, Thomas (editor), ''A Hammock Beneath the Mangoes: stories from Latin America''; Penguin Group, 416–417 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba and exile in France===

In 1921, while studying in Havana, Carpentier became a cultural journalist, writing mostly about avant-garde developments in the arts, particularly music."&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"&gt;Bergh 1972, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed columns to ''La Discusión'', a daily journal from Havana. His journalistic work, which was considered leftist, helped establish the [[Cuban Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;
During 1923 and 1924 he continued to work as a columnist and also edited musical and theatre reviews for ''La Discusión'' and ''[[El Heraldo de Cuba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, with the help of Jorge Mañach, Juan Marinello, Francisco Ichaso, and Martí Casanovas, he became a founding member of ''Revista de Avance'', a magazine devoted to nationalism, radicalism and new ideas in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue appeared on March 15, 1927; it lasted until September 15, 1930, and became the "voice of the vanguard" and the primary voice of expression of the Cuban movement.&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"/&gt; Because of his involvement in such projects, Carpentier was often suspected of having subversive and ultramodern cultural ideas. Carpentier was arrested in 1927 for opposing [[Gerardo Machado y Morales]] dictatorship and had signed a democratic and anti-imperialist manifesto against Machado's regime and, as a result, spent forty days in jail.&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"/&gt; During this brief period in jail he started working on his first novel, ''Ecué-Yamba-O'', an exploration of Afro-Cuban traditions among the poor of the island.&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; (The book was eventually completed in 1933.)

After his release, he escaped Cuba with the help of journalist [[Robert Desnos]] who lent him his passport and papers.&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he was fortunate enough to avoid the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave.

During this time abroad, his disconnection from Cuba and the interaction with different groups of intellectuals and artists in Paris helped with his ‘critical vision’.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier felt that it was important for him to remain outside the influences of movements because he believed in maintaining a “balance against the insularity of his homeland”.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"&gt;Echevarría 1990, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in Paris he immediately began working on poems and editorials in Parisian and Cuban magazines. Contributions to the Parisian Journal such as the short story "Cahiers du Sud" (1933), in French, were an effort to acquire European readers as a way to improve his recognition.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt; He also contributed to the magazines ''Documents'' and ''L’Intransigeant''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier was familiar with the activities of the ''Comité de Jeunes Revolutionnaires Cubains'', a group of exiled Cuban leftists who had published ''La Terreur á Cuba'', a brochure against the Machado government. He documented the latest news about this group and their activities in his book ''Homenaje a nuestros amigos de Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this time that, with the help of Robert Desnos, Carpentier became part of the surrealist movement which became a positive influence in his work. While in France, Carpentier also founded a literary magazine called ''Imán'' in 1931, for which he became editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Mocega-Gonzalez 1980, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the authors who worked with him in ''La Revolution Surrealiste'' also contributed works in ''Imán'' under the title “''Conocimiento de America''”.&lt;ref name="Janney 1981, p.69"&gt;Janney 1981, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier contributed the short story ''Histoire de Lunes'' (1933); it was experimental for its time as it contained elements of fantasy and folklore characterized as magical reality.&lt;ref name="Janney 1981, p.69"/&gt;

Surrealism helped Carpentier to see contexts and aspects, especially those of American life, which he did not see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his “surrealist attempts ha[d] been in vain” describing his frustration, as he felt he had “nothing to add to this movement in France".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

As Carpentier became acquainted with those among the arts community he had several encounters to meet other famous authors such as [[Pablo Neruda]], who had sent him a draft of his book “''Residencia el la Tierra''” to review; Guatemalan author [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]], whose work on pre-Columbian mythology influenced his writing;&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;  and [[Pablo Picasso]], an introduction made possible through Carpentier's connection with friends in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his time in France Carpentier was occupied with not only literary works, but also other projects that kept him engaged within the arts. He collaborated with French composer Marins François Gaillard on the musical ''Yamba-O'', “a burlesque tragedy”, that was presented in the ''Théâtre Beriza'' in Paris (1928); and with composer [[Amadeo Roldán]] helped organize the Cuban premieres of works by [[Stravinsky]] and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]. In film, Carpentier wrote text and edited music for the French documentary ''Le Vaudou''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to earn his living by writing on contemporary culture, both in French and Spanish. He also began working for a French radio station as a sound-technician and producer. From 1932 until 1939 Carpentier worked on several projects produced by Foniric Studios.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt; He directed the production of ''[[Le Livre de Christophe Colomb]]'' and collaborated with Desnos on arranging readings of Edgar Allan Poe's ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'', and Walt Whitman’s ''Salute to the World''. Although abroad, Carpentier still maintained contact with Cuba by sending articles and poems to contribute to Havana publications such as ''Ensayos Convergentes''.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt;

When the Machado regime came to an end in 1933, Carpentier decided to make plans to return to his native land to visit, and in 1936 he made the trip back to Cuba. The time he had spent in Paris for over eleven years had enriched and "oriented his expressive abilities".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier himself indicated that he was tiring of Paris, and "...in 1939 without any other reason than the nostalgia of Cuba, I vacated my apartment and started the return to La Havana".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Years in Haiti and Return to Cuba ===

In 1943, accompanied by French theatrical director [[Louis Jouvet]], Carpentier made a crucial trip to [[Haiti]], during which he visited the fortress of the [[Citadelle Laferrière]] and the Palace of Sans-Souci, both built by the black king [[Henri Christophe]]. This trip, along with readings from [[Oswald Spengler]]'s cyclical interpretation of history, provided the inspiration for his second novel, ''El Reino de Este Mundo'' ''([[The Kingdom of this World]])'' (1949).

Carpentier returned to Cuba and continued to work as a [[journalist]] at the outbreak of World War II. He worked on a history of [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]], eventually published in 1946 as ''La música en Cuba''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 1972. ''La Musica en Cuba''. Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life in Venezuela ===

In 1945, Carpentier moved to Caracas as an exile. From 1945 to 1959 he lived in [[Venezuela]], which is the inspiration for the unnamed South American country in which much of his novel ''The Lost Steps'' takes place.

He wrote short stories which were later collected in ''The War of Time'' (1958).&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; While in Cuba, Carpentier attended a ''[[santería]]'' ceremony that was to further deepen his interest in Afro-Cubanism. In 1949, he finished his novel ''The Kingdom of this World''. This novel has a prologue that "outlines Carpentier's faith in the destiny of [[Latin America]] and the aesthetic implications of its peculiar cultural heritage."&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;

===Later life===
Carpentier returned to Cuba after [[Fidel Castro]]'s Communist revolution in 1959. He worked for the State Publishing House while he completed the baroque-style book, ''El Siglo de las Luces'' ''([[Explosion in a Cathedral]])'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; This novel discusses the advent of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] in the New World. It has twin [[leitmotifs]] of the printing press and the [[guillotine]] and can be read as a "meditation on the dangers inherent in all revolutions as they begin to confront the temptations of dictatorship."&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; After reading the book, [[Gabriel García Márquez]] is said to have discarded the first draft of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' and begun again from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- original edit doesn't give the year - either 1990 or 1993 --&gt;

In 1966, Carpentier settled in Paris where he served as Cuban ambassador to France. In 1975 he was the recipient of the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]. He received the [[Premio Cervantes|Cervantes Prize]]&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{Fr icon}}[http://www.chez.com/jpquin/carpenti.html Une autre vision de Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 and was recipient of the French Laureates [[Prix Médicis]] étranger in 1979 for ''La harpe et l'ombre''.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiki&gt;[[Prix Médicis]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lettre&gt;{{Fr icon}}[http://www.lettresdecuba.cult.cu/global/loader.php?&amp;cont=showpersona.php&amp;num=1&amp;seccion=4&amp;id=7 Lettres de Cuba, Alejo Carpentier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125130521/http://www.lettresdecuba.cult.cu/global/loader.php |date=2007-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpentier was struggling with cancer as he completed his final novel, ''El arpa y la sombra'', and finally died in Paris on April 24, 1980. His remains were returned to Cuba for interment in the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana]].

''[[École Française de la Havane|École Française de la Havane "Alejo Carpentier"]]'', a French international school in Havana, is named after him.

==Themes==

===Lo real maravilloso===
Carpentier is widely known for his theory of ''lo real maravilloso''. This is the notion that the history and the geography of Latin America are both so extreme as to appear fictional or even magical to outsiders. Thus, Latin America is a region where the line between magic and reality is blurred. It was in the prologue to ''The Kingdom of this World'', a novel of the [[Haitian Revolution]], that he described his vision of ''lo real maravilloso'': "But what is the history of Latin America but a chronicle of magical realism?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gosser Esquilín|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel itself develops the outlandish (but true) history of [[Henri Christophe]], first king of Haiti, as an example of how the real history of Latin America is so strange as to appear fictional. Some critics interpret the ''real maravilloso'' as being synonymous with [[magical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|2004|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carpentier's theory and its development in his work are more limited in their scope than is the magical realism of, for example, Gabriel García Márquez. Whereas García Márquez's works include events that the reader never mistakes for reality (rainfall of flowers, old men with wings, etc.), Carpentier, for the most part, simply writes about extreme aspects of the history and geography of Latin America, aspects that are almost unbelievable, but that are in fact true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
As a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under [[Pablo Casals]], and his grandmother played the organ.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier studied music theory at the Lycée Jeanson de Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Colchie|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier's own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|pp=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was [[Amadeo Roldán]], a French musician of Cuban background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|pp= 42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era ''Conciertos de música nueva'' (''Concerts of New Music''), featuring composers such as [[Stravinsky]], [[Milhaud]], [[Ravel]], [[Malipiero]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] and [[Erik Satie]]. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Roldán were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. "¡Abajo la lira, arriba el bongó!"&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Roldán collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece ''Obertura sobre temas cubanos'' (''Overture on Cuban Themes'') which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 43"/&gt;  Other well-known collaborations between the two included ''Tres pequeñas poemas: Oriente, Pregón, Fiesta negra'' (''Three little poems'') produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: ''La Rebambaramba'', a colonial ballet  in two parts (1928) and ''El milagro de Anaquille'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpentier's interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier's works are more listeners than they are readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music's influence over Carpentier's work.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 25"/&gt; In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying "Music is present in all of my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1983|, cited in Navarro (1999) p.156}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music.  As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology and Afro-Cubanism===
With this intrinsic appreciation of music and a fascination with Cuban identity, Carpentier began investigating the origins of Cuban music in a more academic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Carpentier published the ethnomusicological study ''La Música en Cuba'' which explores how European music, transplanted African music and the indigenous music of the island all blended together to create Cuban music. Carpentier took particular interest in Afro-Cuban themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly fascinated with the overwhelming influence of African music in Cuban music, Carpentier introduced Afro-Cuban influenced music called ''lo afrocubano'', (i.e. heavily improvised and rhythm based music) into what was deemed more formal music venues dependent on European styles, called ''lo guajiro''. Carpentier once wrote that ''lo guajiro'' was, "very poetic, but ''lo guajiro'' is not music...On the other hand, in mestizo and black music...the rich material has an incredible wealth to it...to make it the work of national expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 360–362, cited in Navarro (1999) p.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of racial tensions between white Cubans and black and [[criollo people|criollo]] Cubans, such preferences were not well received by the Cuban elite of the mid century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier devoted the majority of his musicology research to the [[Afro-Cuban]] influences present in Cuba. For example, Carpentier paid particular attention to [[Contradanza]], a wildly popular Cuban dance derived from the European style of music and dance, [[Country dance|Contredanse]]. The ample room left for musical improvisation and the element of group dance were easily adapted into African musical tradition where improvisation and dance play integral roles. Hence, a hybrid musical form unique to Cuba was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier argued that the improvisation inherent in African influenced music allowed for varied interpretations that catalyzed regional differences and therefore regional identity, and concluded that this was why Cuba had such a varied musical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''El reino de este mundo'' (The Kingdom of this World)===
Carpentier's ''[[El reino de este mundo]]'' (1949) highlights the [[Haitian Revolution]] of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paravisini-Gebert|2004|p= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel combines not only historical references of the event with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably [[Haitian vodou]]; but also the connections between corporeal and spiritual self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paravisini-Gebert|2004|pp= 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is seen through the eyes of the protagonist Ti Noël, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published on the subject of the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti Noël's point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the [[Sans-Souci Palace]] and the fortress of La Ferrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''La música en Cuba'' (The Music of Cuba)===

''La música en Cuba'' (''The Music of Cuba'') is an ethno-musicological study of the [[Music of Cuba]] starting from the sixteenth century with the arrival of European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different cultures&amp;mdash;black, white, mulattoes, [[criollo people|criollos]] and natives&amp;mdash;mirrors the blending of Cuba’s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, “Los Negros” ("The Blacks")&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th and 19th century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba’s past and integral relationships with a wide range of cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Guerra del tiempo'' (The War of Time)===

''Guerra del tiempo'' (''The War of Time'') is a set of surrealistic short-stories, in a variety of styles, which evidences Carpentier's ability to work with the fantastic and the surreal. The most important is the first one, "El Camino de Santiago" (The Way of Santiago), which narrates the adventures of a commoner, a Spaniard in the Age of Discovery, who is today a soldier, tomorrow pilgrim, then a sailor, a colonizer, prisoner, and so on; he pursues every dream and suffers every disappointment. The second tale is called "Viaje a la semilla" (Journey Back to the Source). This narrative is striking for the function of the time inversion that the narrator operates to tell the life of the main character, Don Marcial (Marqués de Capellanías).

=== ''El Acoso'' (''The Chase'') ===
Carpentier's masterpiece, ''El Acoso'', was originally published in Spanish in 1956 by ,  and translated into American English by Alfred Mac Adam as ''The Chase'' and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1989,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chase|last=Carpentier|first=Alejo|publisher=New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux|year=1989|isbn=|location=|publication-date=1989|pages=|translator-last=Mac Adam|translator-first=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; after over three decades of suppression in the United States for Carpentier's affiliation with Fidel Castro's Cuba&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chase|last=Fuentes|first=Carlos|last2=Carpentier|publisher=Farrar, Straus, Giroux|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Carpentier had been Cuba's ambassador to France during this time).  The novel is one of the most influential novels in contemporary Latin American literature, cited by authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jose Donoso and others as a major influence in the movement known in North America as Latin American Magical Realism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The novel is highly compressed, richly atmospheric, philosophical, stylistically brilliant, and non-linear; plot is treated almost as an inconsequential side-effect.  Though short (121 pages in English), the novel exhibits a certain labyrinthine quality as its fragmented narrative cycles and circles in upon itself. Ostensibly a man is being chased by somewhat shadowy, probably sinister, perhaps governmental, forces.  The action starts on a rainy night at a symphonic concert and music plays a part in the clues necessary to piece together what is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  ''The Chase'' is perhaps Carpentier's strongest novel, and easily one of the better novels written in the 20th century, though it is almost unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of Mac Adam's superb 1989 translation.

==Style==

===Baroque===
The [[Baroque]] style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often defined as "the dominant style of art in Europe between the [[Mannerist]] and [[Rococo]] eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piper|1984|pp= 44–45, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes ''el barroco'' as ''un espíritu'', and not ''un estilo histórico'' ("a spirit, not an historical style").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1990|p= 175, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: "first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early ''Ecue-Yamba-O'' to the celebrated ''El reino de este mundo'', regarding Carpentier's use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically-inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of "nativism" by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the "New World Baroque", since Latin America didn't come into contact with the Enlightenment or "European modernity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|p= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''contraconquista'' (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|pp= 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that "American Baroque develop[ed] along with ''criollo'' culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a ''criollo''; and the ''criollo'' spirit is itself a Baroque spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1975|p= 100, cited in Kaup (2005) p.110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''criollo'' of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|p= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of travel===
Wakefield notes that Carpentier's diverse travels were motivated by his need to incorporate the sights he experienced into familiar descriptions within his novels. Carpentier's ''El reino de este mundo'' was inspired by his 1943 trip to Haiti, and ''Los pasos perdidos'' drew on his visit to Venezuela in 1949. Similarly, his travels to Guadeloupe and the Gulf of Sante Fe inspired ''El siglo de las luces'', and Vera and Enrique's firsthand descriptions of Baku and Mexico in ''La consegración de la primavera'' were drawn from Carpentier's trips to those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
During his visit to France early in his life, Carpentier met and collaborated with many figures of the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement. Taken with Surrealist theory, Carpentier absorbed much of it from his contemporaries, mainly his friend and colleague, the Parisian journalist [[Robert Desnos]]. Striving to portray unlikely beauty, termed, "the third beauty", Surrealist theory embraced unique perspectives of the world.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Surrealist theory was the concept of [[Primitivism]] or a reverence for presiding folkloric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leante|1970|pp= 21–22, cited in Navarro (1999) p.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier, inspired by French Surrealists, learned to view his Cuban home in this new light. He left France with a bursting sense of Cuban and Latin American pride and the artistic goal to capture what it meant to be both.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 62"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10906">The '''American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence''', often referred to as the '''American Board''', was launched with a $5 million federal grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Archibald, George, "Paige backs reform in certification of teachers, Washington Times (March 19, 2003) http://www.udel.edu/educ/whitson/897s05/files/Paige%20backs%20reform%20in%20certification%20of%20teachers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The non-partisan, [[non-profit organization]]'s mission is to certify subject experts, experienced professionals, career changers, and military veterans as teachers and was endorsed by U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Shawn Arévalo McCollough]] serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shawn Arévalo McCollough - President &amp; CEO|url = http://abcte.org/about-us/president/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online, [[alternative certification|alternative teaching certification]] program is approved in [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Become a Teacher, Teach, Become Certified to Teach|url = http://abcte.org/teach/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was launched in [[Arizona]] as the Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;AZ TV7, http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710190426/http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages |date=2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3"&gt;http://azctp.org/testimonials-2/&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/ariz-teachers-recruit-idUSnPNDC38485+1e0+PRN20130625&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The American Board is dedicated to preparing, certifying, and supporting individuals who want to improve their communities by becoming a teacher. The training and certification program is designed to inspire career changers to become a teacher and give them a rigorous and efficient process to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The program is entirely online and self-paced. Candidates have 12 months to complete the program, though the average amount of time it takes most candidates is between 7 and 10 months. A bachelor's degree is required for acceptance into the American Board teaching certification program, and participants must pass a background check. Candidates enrolled in the program study for and take two certification exams- one that covers Professional Teaching Knowledge (PTK) and one that covers subject area knowledge. The program is online,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-what-is-nctq-and-why-you-should-know/2012/05/23/gJQAg7CrlU_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; giving candidates the flexibility to work towards earning their certification on their own time.

==Acceptance of Certifications==
American Board certification is recognized in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. Many [[charter school|charter]] and [[private school]]s nationwide also recognize the certification. Certification areas are [[Primary education|elementary education]], English, mathematics, general science, biology, physics, chemistry, U.S. history, world history and [[special education]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of certification areas and requirements vary by state.

==History==
The American Board was founded in 2001 with a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Developed on the foundation that highly trained and skilled professionals should have the opportunity to pursue a career in teaching, the American Board was created with a mission to give enable qualified individuals a flexible and affordable path to teacher certification in their state.

The first state to accept the American Board certification for its public schools was Pennsylvania, when the State Board of Education adopted it in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202113008/http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early study of the American Board teacher certification by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found the program to be enrolling and screening increasing numbers of candidates with the average age of nearly 40, suggesting candidates are primarily career changers with more work experience than other entry-level teachers. Most candidates were able to find teaching positions soon after finishing the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/ABCTE.pdf “An Evaluation of American Board Teacher Certification: Progress and Plans”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217141845/http://mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/ABCTE.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} Mathematica Policy Research (May 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]] announced the American Board would receive a $35 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] for its continued development of a fast-track route into the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Julie. [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11062254/ed-dept-gives-35-million-teacher-credential-board “Ed. Dept. Gives $35 Million To Teacher-Credential Board”] Education Week (October 1, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idaho State Board of Education approved the American Board program as a route to a full teacher license in November 2003. Idaho Governor [[Dirk Kempthorne]] said should he decide to become a teacher after politics, he would use the American Board program to become a certified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130713023419/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=030304&amp;ID=s1494819 “Teacher Test Draws Praise and Complaints] The Spokesman Review (March 3, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida State Board of Education approved the American Board program in June 2004. Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] was a supporter,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Beth. [http://www.minnpost.com/learning-curve/2011/04/jeb-bush-touts-florida-school-reforms-capitols-supportive-gop-skeptical-dfl “Jeb Bush touts Florida school reforms to Capitol's supportive GOP, skeptical DFL”] Minn Post (April 26, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  and President [[George H.W. Bush]] received his teacher certification through an alternative program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://educationviews.org/test-3/ “George Bush Sr. Received an Alternative Teaching Certificate”] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130713023452/http://educationviews.org/test-3/ |date=2013-07-13 }} Education News (July 23, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Utah House Standing Committee introduced HB0110 and, although it did not pass, the American Board program was approved in November 2004 by the Utah State Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/utah-adopts-american-board-certification-helping-state/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, the New Hampshire Commissioner of Education approved the American Board program.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/new-hampshire/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mississippi Professional Standards Board approved the program in July 2006. Governor [[Haley Barbour]] said, "In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Mississippi faces years of recovery and rebuilding. To ensure that we accomplish our goals, Mississippi communities are working together to improve our schools so that every child in Mississippi has an opportunity to succeed. First and foremost, we must recruit the very best teachers for our students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://neshobademocrat.com/print.asp?ArticleID=13084&amp;SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=297 “Barbour Celebrates Launch of Teacher Certification Program”] The Neshoba Democrat (August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] adopted alternative certification as a pathway to teaching and cited the American Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://usmayors.org/workforce/documents/2006RECRUITINGResolution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina House Bill 3476 was signed into law on June 13, 2007, accepting American Board certification. Governor [[Mark Sanford]] said the program would "make a real impact in getting more qualified teachers in our classrooms, and we're pleased to welcome this program to our state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-option-for-south-carolina-teacher-certification-58092782.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Missouri Governor [[Matt Blunt]] signed Senate Bill 1066 on May 1, 2008 allowing American Board certificate holders to practice there. The Governor said, "Under the old system, Bill Gates couldn’t teach a class in computer software in a Missouri high school. This bill allows experienced professionals to become certified teachers.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showmedaily.org/2008/05/a-victory-for-a.html “A Victory for Certification”] Show Me Daily (May 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oklahoma House passed Senate Bill 582 with a unanimous vote of 99 to zero in April 2009, and it was soon signed into law, making Oklahoma the ninth American Board state.

In July 2009, the American Board announced that the organization's initial grant had drawn to a close and it had reached a financial position that will allow the organization to continue to operate without requesting an extension of these government funds.

The Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation was launched in 2013.&lt;ref name="AZ" /&gt; Then Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3" /&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ2"&gt;Gonzales, Angela “[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/06/27/center-for-teacher-preparation.html "Center for teacher preparation offering $1000 scholarships for wannabe teachers"]” Phoenix Business Journal (June 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Aid==
The American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence provides reduced enrollment pricing for those who fall within the parameters of the Federal Reduced Lunch Rate Act, which is based on household size, and combined income.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22907">'''Architectural endoscopy''' or '''architectural envisioning''' is used to photograph and film models of new buildings' exterior and interior in the planning stage. An [[architectural model]] of a new building in a 1:500 scale is thus correctly visualized from the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of a pedestrian walking by in the street. An endoscope connected to a video camera allows for the creation of walkthroughs, allowing the architect to develop the first draft further, and the public to share and critique the architect's vision of proposed buildings and cities.

== Nomenclature ==
In architecture the rigid [[Endoscopy|endoscope]] is called a ''Relatoskop'' (German), ''relatoscop'' (French), [[borescope]], etc. In this article, 'endoscope' is used as a generic term.

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-28849-0005, Rostock, Architekten bei der Stadtplanung.jpg|thumb|Architects examining a model (urban planning) from a bird's-eye view, [[Rostock]], 1955]]

The endoscope was invented in 1806 by [[Philipp Bozzini]], in medicine it was used to look inside the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Bozzini (1806), {{Google books|dn8tAAAAcAAJ||page=107-124 ''Lichtleiter, eine Erfindung zur Anschauung innerer Teile und Krankheiten, nebst der Abbildung'', Journal der practischen Arzneykunde und Wundarzneykunst}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Paris-based German architect, [[Martin Schulz van Treeck]] (van Treeck), was the first to use endoscopes for visualisation of architectural models. The endoscopes were his father's, [[Alfred Schulz van Treeck]], physician and pioneer in [[Otoscope|otoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;The father of Martin Schulz van Treeck [http://www.geni.com/people/Alfred-Schulz-van-Treeck/6000000013443143150 Alfred Schulz van Treeck]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orgues&gt;Jean-François Pousse [http://www.lemoniteur.fr/article/l-invention-de-la-tour-europeenne-13-30-les-orgues-de-flandre-1976-paris-754715 Orgues de Flandre] LE MONITEUR.FR, Publié le 03/07/09, Retrieved January 7. 2016. (fr)&lt;/ref&gt;

He published the first article in the architecture journal ''Bauen + Wohnen'' in 1957, titled "Real model photograph as a new representation method in architecture planning" (''Reale Modellphotographie als neue Darstellungsmethode in der Architekturplanung'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Reale Modellphotographie als neue Darstellungsmethode in der Architekturplanung'', Bauen + Wohnen, 1957, pp. 332—334.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architectural design competition]]s, it is common that a 1:500 scale model of the building is shown in addition to the plans during the presentation. These models are usually seen and photographed from a [[bird's-eye view]]. Van Treeck was aware of the problem to mediate architectural design to builders and investors, when seen from the traditional bird's-eye perspective. His idea was to use the endoscope photos as base for drawings of the model and present these to clients or the public, to show what the building would look like if they were walking or driving in the street next to it. He could place the endoscope in a pedestrian's position in the model. Architectural models in 1:500 or 1:100 scale were represented in photos, and later in videos, the way a pedestrian would see the finished building.&lt;ref name=Darstellung &gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Möglichkeiten der ''Darstellung'' und Abklärung architektonischer Projekte'', in DETAIL, Verlag Architektur + Baudetail GmbH, München, 1974, Nr. 4 Juli – August, pp. 635–642.&lt;/ref&gt;

The endoscope became known among architects and builders through its use by van Treeck in the [[Urban planning|planning]] of the [[Orgues de Flandre]] residential buildings on Avenue de Flandre, [[19th arrondissement of Paris|19th arrondissement]] in Paris. The four central residential towers of the settlement have different heights and are designed in the shape of [[organ pipe]]s. They are called ''Prelude'', ''Fugue'', ''Cantata'' and ''4'', which explains the name ''Orgues de Flandre'' ("Church organs of Flanders").&lt;ref Name=invention &gt;''Orgues de Flandre'' [http://www.lemoniteur.fr/article/l-''invention''-de-la-tour-europeenne-13-30-les-orgues-de-flandre-1976-paris-754715]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Relatoscope &gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/colan_0336-1500_1974_num_23_1_4130 ''Relatoscope'', ''Orgues de Flandre'', Martin S. van Treeck]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Treeck used an endoscope for photography and especially video films, on models in a 1:500 to 1:100 scale in the architectural competition and further planning of the ''Orgues de Flandre'' buildings. He documented his work using an endoscope from the beginning.

At the construction and architecture exhibition, ''Batimat'', November 1973 in Paris and ''Constructa'', February 1974 in Hannover, van Treeck and a company introduced the endoscope for the first time on a large scale to members of the international architecture and construction sector. In 1974, van Treeck described the endoscope and its uses for the ''Orgues de Flandre'' project, in an article in the German architecture magazine ''[[DETAIL (professional journal)|DETAIL]]''.&lt;ref name=Darstellung /&gt; A French article by François Loyer is available online as a PDF, and includes endoscope photos of the ''Orgues de Flandre'' project.&lt;ref Name=invention /&gt;&lt;ref name= Relatoscope /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Loyer: Pour bien lire une maquette d'architecture : le relatoscope, In: Communication et langages, 1974, Volume 23, Numéro 1, pp. 56-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In 1974, after the presentation at the trade fairs and the articles in specialist magazines, the use of endoscopes was examined at international universities in the scope of research projects on urban planning. For example, architects and town planners such as urban designer [[Carl-Axel Acking]] from [[Lund]], Sweden; [[Donald Appleyard]] from [[Berkeley, California]], United States; [[Hendrik van Leeuwen]] from [[Wageningen]], Netherlands and [[Antero Markelin]] from [[Stuttgart]], Germany; early on explored the use of endoscopes. The focus of their research was the use of video films in urban planning. For experiments, the simulation equipment presented by van Treeck at the fairs was purchased and, because of low funding, "model simulation systems" were built by the institutes for less money. This was done at the [[University of Stuttgart|Urban Planning Institute of the University of Stuttgart]] where Antero Markelin taught and researched. The result of his two-year research in Stuttgart in 1975–1977, was published in 1979 in the book ''Environmental Simulation, sensory simulation in urban development'' (''Umweltsimulation, sensorische Simulation im Städtebau'').&lt;ref name="Umweltsimulation"&gt;Antero Markelin, Bernd Fahle Hrsg: ''Umweltsimulation, Sensorische Simulation im Städtebau'', Stuttgart, Krämer, 1979, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first conference of the ''European Architectural Endoscopy Association'' (EAEA) in 1993 at the [[Tampere University of Technology]] in Finland, the ''Urban Simulator'' that the Tampere School of Architecture started to build in 1978 was demonstrated. The system as well as the computer control was primarily developed and built by the researchers at the school, because the existing financial resources were very small.&lt;ref name= Siitonen &gt;''Siitonen'', Petri: "Future of Endoscopy", in: Seppo Aura (et al.), Endoscopy as a Tool in Architecture. Tampere, 1993, pp. 181-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?cc06 Future of Endoscopy in Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Petri Siitonen at the Faculty of Architecture of [[Helsinki University of Technology]], spoke at the conference in his lecture ''The Future of Endoscopy'', about a comparison between the use of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and endoscope in works made by students. At that time, a study revealed that endoscopy got 27 points and CAD 20 points. He also mentioned that this would change in the years to come.&lt;ref name=Siitonen /&gt;

== European Architectural Endoscopy Association (EAEA) ==
The [[European Architectural Endoscopy Association]] (EAEA) was established in 1993. The founding meeting took place at a conference at the Institute of Architecture Technical University of Tampere in Finland. It was the first international conference at which experts from fifteen universities that conducted research and teaching in the field of visualization with endoscopes, presented their results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/10794 first conference in 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conferences have been held every second year since then. The ninth conference was organized by the [[Brandenburg University of Technology|Faculty of Architecture of the Technical University of Cottbus-Senftenberg]] in 2009. At that conference, the participants agreed to change the name of the EAEA. Instead of ''endoscopy'', the word ''envisioning'' would henceforth be used by the association. {{As of|2015}}, their name is ''European Architectural Envisioning Association'' (EAEA). Thus, the rapid development of computer hardware and software for visualization of construction projects, from single-family homes to urban planning, was included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tudelft-architecture.nl/chairs/form-modelling-studies/research/eaea2011-conference From Conference 9 to Conference 10 – From Endoscopy to Envisioning]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lodz University of Technology]] (TUL) hosted the 12th EAEA conference in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaea12-2015.p.lodz.pl/ Konferenz EAEA 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for conferences in [[Istanbul]], Turkey and [[Montana]] in 2016 and in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in 2017, were started in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wit.edu/news/2015/11/2015-11-25-staff-faculty.html Conferences for 2016 and 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The EAEA conferences are held each odd-numbered year.

== Practical application ==
In addition to funded research projects at universities, endoscopes have been used by photographers and videographers in studios since 1974, in works for architecture and advertising clients. As special optical instruments, endoscopes became part of the photographic or video equipment in photo studios. For example, in Germany, they were used since 1974 for visual examination of models in Ingo Wende's studio in [[Berlin]], and since 1975 by [[Alex Kempkens]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Wende: Modellsimulation, in Baumeister, München, 1/1981, pp. 58 – 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris Schmidt: ''Warten auf den Start.'' In: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', Nr. 294 vom 18./19. Dezember 1976, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Assignments from architects and builders were generally to take pictures of their models with [[Large format (photography)|large format camera]]s and endoscopes. Short films were produced as [[video]]s or [[16 mm film]]. The films were generally used on larger urban projects for public relations and public information.&lt;ref name="Umweltsimulation" /&gt; {{As of|2015}}, only a few photo studios working with endoscope photography still exists.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Orgues de Flandre - Paris - Martin Schulz van Treeck, Photo Maxim Pouska.jpg|thumb|Orgues de Flandre, Paris, by architect Martin Schulz van Treeck, 2016]]

Van Treeck wrote about the fact that, with an endoscope, a model is photographed from normal eye level.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Möglichkeiten der Darstellung und Abklärung architektonischer Projekte'', in DETAIL, Verlag Architektur + Baudetail GmbH, München, 1974, Nr. 4 Juli – August, pp. 636, 642.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sense of Relatoskopie lies in adjusting the view of the observer to the scale of the architecture model, and bring it inside the model at the usual human eye level. ... When comparing reality with simulation through a scale model reality, the credibility of Relatoskopie is proven. The transfer is not illusory, but it brings the essential information regarding the body of the building and its spatial organization forth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opponents of controversial construction projects were never convinced, and they criticize the method. Their main critique was that the pictures were photographed from an [[ant]]'s perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Kirchenhofer: ''Ansichten aus der Ameisenperspektive'', ZEITmagazin, München, 1980, Nr. 23, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The eye level of a {{convert|170|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} person is approximately {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}. In a 1:100 scale, the eye level of a pedestrian in a model is at {{convert|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} and this level can be precisely maintained with an endoscope, which preferably has a diameter of {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

== Working with endoscopes ==
To achieve higher quality photographs or films, rigid endoscopes were more suitable because of the quality of the images. An example of this was the [[Endoscopy#Rod-lens endoscopes|rod-lens endoscope]] invented by [[Harold Hopkins (physicist)|Harold Hopkins]]. The more flexible [[Optical fiber|fiber-optic]] endoscope, called [[fiberscope]] or flexoscope, made from bundled glass fibers do not produce the same quality pictures.

From the start, rigid endoscopes were used for direct viewing, photography, video and film in environmental simulation and for interior and exterior shots of models. Endoscopes used for industrial applications, called [[borescope]]s, were basically the same as those used in architecture. Specially developed borescopes were used temporarily in model visualization. Video and film needed strong light and lamps and spotlights with high wattages were required. In professional photo studios, powerful flash units were used. Light emitted from optical fiber systems, which was used in the medicine, was seldom used for architectural models.

The model simulation system presented by van Treek at trade fairs required the endoscope, connected to a video camera or a camera, to be mounted vertically above the model. This was necessary because the viewing angle of the optic was 90 degrees sideways. The system was complex and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Antero Markelin, Bernd Fahle Hrsg.: Umweltsimulation, sensorische Simulation im Städtebau, Stuttgart, Krämer, 1979, pp. 74–81, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; When used for photography, endoscopes with different viewing angles could be used, and because of this the camera did not have to be in a vertical position above the model.

== Model visualization before and after 1995 ==
Starting in the early 1960s, research has been done and published on the use of computers in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnett: ''Will the Computer Change the Practice of Architecture?'' In: Architectural Record, January 1965, McGraw-Hill, pp. 143–150&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1995, visualization of a model as a computer image or a [[computer animation]] was so complex and expensive that it was rarely an alternative to the less costly endoscope photography or short film. Exceptions were made for prestigious projects, such as in 1984, when a computer model was made of the [[Louvre Pyramid|glass pyramid]] for the modernization of the [[Louvre]] by architect [[I. M. Pei|Ieoh Ming Pei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic30775.files/3-5_Louvre.pdf] HARVARD DESIGN SCHOOL CDI: THE GRAND LOUVRE.&lt;/ref&gt;

At move of the Tampere School of Architecture in 1995, the 20 year old "Urban Simulator" was replaced by a modern endoscope system. The latest endoscopes, components and computers were installed for camera control, image processing, and modern computing methods. The new laboratory was presented at the 1997 Conference of EAEA at the [[Delft University of Technology]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks.id-0e8f Developing a new endoscopy laboratory with digital tools]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, endoscope technology for visualization of architectural models is only offered at a few universities in the context of education and research. This is now done parallel with [[architectural animation]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]], [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[Virtual reality|VR]] simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Ryuzo OHNO, [http://www.enveng.titech.ac.jp/ohno/simulation_methods-e.html ''SIMULATION METHODS''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070109/http://www.enveng.titech.ac.jp/ohno/simulation_methods-e.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}, Tokyo Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of technology in computers, lighting, software, wireless data transmission, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD-Sensors]], [[Endoscopy|Videoendoscope]] and more, was so rapid in the decades following 1995, that an architecture student in the 2010s can barely imagine how laborious model simulation and visualization was earlier. The development of endoscopes also benefited from the new technology during those years. An example of this development is the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]], (DIAP), which was founded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.polimi.it/emma/showEvent.do?page%3D2100%26idEvent%3D60 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225546/http://emma.polimi.it/emma/showEvent.do?page=2100&amp;idEvent=60 |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the Politecnico di Milano&lt;/ref&gt; At the EAEA Conference in Milan in 2013, a demonstration was made of a mini car with a micro-camera that could go into a model street, {{convert|2.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, to record a video from the eye-level perspective in the car. The images were transmitted directly to a screen. The mini car was moved by hand through the city model. The earlier elaborate technical design for video recording was no longer necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaea11-2013.polimi.it/ 2013 EAEA Mailand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224110127/http://www.eaea11-2013.polimi.it/ |date=February 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2rxqB5dDpQ&amp;list=PL204DE54BAD787951&amp;index=3 Endoscopy Architectural MicroCar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genuine models that can be touched and examined from all angles, will continue to be built. They will be made for education and to meet clients demands as well as for presentation of projects at international property and investment trade fairs in Europe and worldwide. There are still models that can be viewed from a bird's-eye view in exhibition halls, such as the [[Expo Real]], [[Munich]] or the [[MIPIM]] in [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]], [[Cannes]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exporeal.net/messe/messeprofil/ EXPO REAL, München]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipim.com/ MIPIM, Cannes]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renaissance of endoscopy ==
At the EAEA Conference 1993 in Tampere Bob Martens said: "A renaissance of endoscopy could thus be envisaged at least for still pictures". He also worked with 3D computer simulation but said that endoscopy continues to have advantages in the training of students: "Endoscopy is not overloaded with theory; Students can tackle the subject in a playful manner ".&lt;ref name=martens&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martens|first1=Bob|title=A Renaissance of architectural endoscopy?|url=http://info.tuwien.ac.at/eaea/Renaissance/rae.html|website=www.tuwien.ac.at|publisher=[[Vienna University of Technology ]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He could not foresee the technical development plus the cost reduction in the decades following his presentation. In the summer of 2015, two of the largest retail chains in Germany sold [[videoscope]] cameras for €60 as "men's toys". At the present, it is even possible for students to create their own video with endoscopes to visualize their models for a presentation at the end of the semester. Rigid endoscopes and related photographic equipment have also become affordable. The reduction of costs for the use of endoscopes supports the thesis of Bob Martens, that it may 'come to a' 'Renaissance of endoscopy'.&lt;ref name=martens /&gt;

== Reception ==
Martin Schulz van Treeck's idea in 1954, was about the eye-level perspective of the pedestrian and the need to convey the concept of the design to clients and the citizens. At the time, an endoscope was the only tool available to photograph and film architectural models from this perspective. The digital revolution was in its infancy and had not yet developed tools ([[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]) sufficiently to realize his idea. Since then, decades have passed and with computers the eye-level perspective of a pedestrian can be visualized as a photo or a movie without difficulty. The endoscope of yesteryear has been supplemented in the digital age by new technologies, establishing van Treek's idea to present designs from the perspective of pedestrians.

'''Institut Pertanian Bogor''' ('''IPB''' or '''Bogor Agricultural University''') is a state-run agricultural university based in the city of [[Bogor]], [[Indonesia]].

The institute began as an agricultural school formed by the Dutch colonial regime in the early 20th century. After independence it was part of the [[Universitas Indonesia]] before becoming an independent institute on September 1, 1963.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-embrional-step History of IPB Embryonal Step (1941-1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Growth phase"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-growth-phase History of IPB Growth phase].&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Dr. Ir. Herry Suhardiyanto, M.Sc. serves as its director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/rectors-of-ipb History of IPB - Rectors] retrieved September 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016646.jpg|thumb|The Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg in the 1920s]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nederlands-Indische Veeartsenschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016929.jpg|thumb|The Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool in the 1920s]]
The first school in Bogor was established in 1876 under [[Rudolph Scheffer]], under the name ''landbouwschool te Buitenzorg'' (agriculture school).&lt;ref name="Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaalherbarium.nl/FMCollectors/S/SchefferRHCC.htm|title=Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel|publisher=[[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New schools for different fields were opened in the following years for Native Indonesians. The institute started in the early 20th century as a veterinary medicine and agricultural school.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"/&gt; Before World War II, the institutions were known as Middelbare Landbouwschool (secondary agricultural school), Middelbare Bosbouwschool (secondary forestry school) dan Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool (veterinary school).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|H. J. Lovink's]] appointment as department director of agricultural education in 1910 marked a curriculum shift toward training for the government and private sides of colonial agribusiness, including basic biology classes augmented with practical education about cultivation techniques and technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Floracrats: State-Sponsored Science and the Failure of the Enlightenment in Indonesia|last=Goss|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-299-24864-2|location=United States of America|pages=92|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|Lovink]] argued that department officials in the Ministry of Agriculture "needed to familiarize themselves with Javanese farming practices."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1940, the Dutch government founded an Institution of Agricultural Higher Education in Bogor with the name Landbouw Hogeschool, which later on 31 October 1941 was called Landbouwkundige Faculteit (Agronomy Faculty). However, the school was closed down during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945). The Nederlandsch Indische Veeartsenschool remained in operation, but its name was changed to Bogōru jūigakkō (ボゴール獣医学校) (Bogor Veterinary School).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

Sometime after the declaration of independence in 1946, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the new Republic of Indonesia upgraded the Veterinary School in Bogor to the College of Veterinary Medicine (PTKH).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

The Netherlands returned to Indonesia and retook control of the institution in 1947, thus Landbouwkundige Faculteit was reopened as the Faculteit Voor Landbouw-Wetenschappen, which had majors in Agriculture and Forestry. In 1948 the PTKH or College of Veterinary Medicine was changed to Faculteit voor Diergeneeskunde under Universiteit van Indonesië (later the [[University of Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; 
 
After Indonesia gained its independence in 1950, Landbouw-wetenschappen became the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Indonesia, with three departments — Socio-Economics, Physical Sciences, and Forestry. In 1957 the Department of Land Fishery was formed. Meanwhile, Faculteit voor Dieergeneeskunde became the Faculty of Veterinary Medicines and Animal Husbandry.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

IPB was founded on September 1, 1963 by the decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education No. 92/1963 and was approved by President [[Sukarno]]'s decree No. 279/1965.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt; At the time, the two faculties of University of Indonesia which is in Bogor were separated into an independent institution. The new university (IPB) has five faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Fisheries, Animal Science, and Forestry. In 1964 the Faculty of Technology and Mechanization of Agriculture was added.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt;

===Recent events===
On December 26, 2000 the Indonesia government changed IPB's autonomy status to a state-owned university.

In 2005, IPB applied the [[Minor (academic)|minor]] and [[Major (academic)|major]] system instead of the national curriculum system.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/index.php/education/undergraduate IPB Undergraduate system].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/12503 IPB Undergraduate system evaluation].&lt;/ref&gt; This allow IPB students to take more than one department field.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate" /&gt;

==Symbol and flags==

===Logo and philosophy===
[[File:Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) symbol.svg|alt=Bogor Agricultural University symbol|thumb|200x200px|Bogor Agricultural University symbol]]
The logo consist of "Institut Pertanian Bogor" text, a tree with three branches and five leaves, and an open book which are all lined by a white circle on a blue background. The logo reflects IPB as an academic institution, source of knowledge and technology, with the "Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi" obligation.

The basic blue color symbolizes IPB as a science and technology university, the open book symbolizes IPB as a source of knowledge, the circle symbolizes that science has no limits and always growing, the three branches growing from the book symbolize Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi (IPB's three commitments: Education, Research, and Community Service), and the five leaves represent the first five faculties of IPB and symbolize Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi which is based on [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]].&lt;ref name="Symbol and Flag"&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=IPB |title=Symbol and Flag |date=25 September 2013 |url=http://ipb.ac.id/about/symbol-and-flag |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculties and departments==
Institut Pertanian Bogor has agricultural, livestock, veterinary, and life science studies.

IPB consist of nine faculties providing an undergraduate program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=IPB |title=Faculties and Departements |date=25 September 2010 |url=http://ipb.ac.id/offices-and-services/fakdept |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate and postgraduate programs are managed by a separate graduate school. In 1972, IPB implemented a four-year undergraduate curriculum and, in 1975, opened the first graduate school in Indonesia.

IPB undergraduate new students are required to pass a Common First Year Program (''Tingkat Persiapan Bersama (TPB)'') before entering any faculties or department although they are enrolled as a student of specific faculties and department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visi dan Misi |url=http://tpb.ipb.ac.id/visi-a-misi |publisher=Tingkat Persiapan Bersama IPB |accessdate=25 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927132447/http://tpb.ipb.ac.id/visi-a-misi |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also required to live in dormitories during the first year.

Institut Pertanian Bogor has a diploma program that is separated from the faculties and managed under the Directorate of Diploma Program. Unlike the undergraduate students, a common first year program is unavailable for diploma program students.

===Faculty of Human Ecology===

==== History ====
The [http://fema.ipb.ac.id Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA)] is the youngest faculty in IPB; it was established on August 2, 2005 by the Rector’s decree no. 112/K13/OT/2005.  his establishment was IPB’s answer to changes that were taking place toward the era of higher education autonomy (IPB BHMN) which granted the university the power to form new study programs, departments, and faculties.

The roots of [http://fema.ipb.ac.id FEMA IPB] were the former Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture; Study Program of Agriculture Extension and Communication of Socioeconomy Department, Faculty of Agriculture; and socioeconomic study programs of all the other faculties in IPB.

The Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture was developed into [http://gizi.fema.ipb.ac.id Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ)] and [http://ikk.fema.ipb.ac.id Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK)]. While the Department of Agricultural Socioeconomy (SOSEK) of Faculty of Agriculture was transformed into [http://skpm.ipb.ac.id Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM)], Department of Agribusiness, and Department of Environmental Resource Economy (ESL). Furthermore; through the clustering process; the Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ), the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK), and the Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM) merged up to become the Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA).

[http://fema.ipb.ac.id FEMA IPB] is the first and only faculty of its kind in Indonesia and it is one of the three faculties of human ecology throughout South East Asia. The others are in the College of Human Ecology University of Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB) and the Faculty of Human Ecology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).

As a [[paraphilia]],&lt;!-- NOTE: The lead starts with "As a paraphilia" to better distinguish the paraphilia aspect from the normal attraction aspect; see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#First sentence. --&gt; '''breast fetishism''' (also known as '''mastofact''', '''breast partialism''', or '''mazophilia''')&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2003). Encyclopaedia of Murder and Violent Crime. Sage Publications Inc. {{ISBN|0-7619-2437-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly atypical [[sexual interest]] focused on female [[breast]]s (see [[partialism]]).&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Association|first=American Psychiatric|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders American Psychiatric Association - 5th edition. |year=2013|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Publishing]]|location=Arlington|isbn=978-0890425558|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''breast fetishism'' is also used in the non-paraphilic sense, to refer to cultural attention to female breasts and the [[sexuality]] they represent, with debate existing as to whether the modern widespread fascination with breasts among [[heterosexual]] males in western societies is a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latteier|1998|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==
Scientists have hypothesized that non-[[paraphilic]] sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a [[secondary sex characteristic]]. For instance, [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the [[Buttock cleavage|cleft between the buttocks]], which according to Morris in ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' is also unique to humans, other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris. ''Manwatching. A Field Guide to Human Behavior.''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1977. {{ISBN|0-8109-1310-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other [[primate]]s' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allows human females to "solicit [human] male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile".&lt;ref name=Crawford1998 &gt;{{citation |last=Crawford |first=Charles |year=1998 | title=''Handbook of evolutionary psychology : ideas, issues, and applications'' |chapter=How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature |last2=Krebs|first2=Dennis |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=9780805816662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverence and theorizing shown to breasts also appears in the science of modern civilization. Breast fetishism is claimed to be an example of a contagious thought (or [[meme]]) spreading throughout society, and that breasts are features that have evolved to influence human sexuality rather than serve an exclusive maternal function.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Paul. (1999). Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation. [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/2/review4.html ''Review of Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads through Society''.] Retrieved 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In clinical literature of the 19th century, the sexual focus on breasts was considered a form of paraphillia, but, in modern times, this attraction is considered normal unless it is highly atypical and is therefore a form of [[partialism]].&lt;ref name="DSM-5"/&gt;

==Alternative opinions==
The term ''breast fetishism'' is also used within [[ethnographic]] and feminist contexts to describe a society with a culture devoted to breasts, usually as sexual objects.&lt;ref name="ggf2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Phil. (1989). ''Motivation and Emotion''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-01475-1}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Feminism|feminists]] have argued that incidences of breast fetishism have been found going back to the [[neolithic]] era, with the goddess shrines of [[Catal Huyuk]] (in modern [[Turkey]]). The archaeological excavations of the town in c. 1960 revealed the walls of the shrine(s) adorned with disembodied pairs of breasts that appeared to have "an existence of their own". [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]] argues that breasts (along with [[phallus]]es) were revered by the women of [[Catal Huyuk]] as instruments of motherhood, but it was after what she describes as a patriarchal revolution – when men had appropriated both phallus worship and "the breast fetish" for themselves – that these organs "acquired the erotic significance with which they are now endowed".&lt;ref&gt;''The First Sex: The Breast Fetish'' (1971) by Davis, Elizabeth Gould. Penguin Books, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors from the United States have made the statement that attraction to the female breast is a sexual fetish, that it is the American fetish-object of choice,&lt;ref&gt;''Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide'' (2000) by Slade, Joseph W. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|978-0-313-31520-6}}, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; and that breast fetishism is predominantly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Laura. (2006). ''Beauty Up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics''. p. 74. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latteier|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, D. E., &amp; Holden, C. P. (1971).

==Cultural and historical background==
[[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] may have been forms of erotic art, or fertility icons. Shown here is the [[Venus of Willendorf]], 28,000 [[Before Common Era|B.C.E]] – 25,000 B.C.E.]]
There is a widespread fascination with women's breasts, and especially their size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yeung|first1=Peter|title=The female artists reclaiming their bodies|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/22316/1/the-female-artists-reclaiming-their-bodies|website=Dazed|accessdate=20 November 2014|quote=The fetishisation of womens’ bodies and their regular reduction to breasts is something that New York artist Cindy Hinant is acutely aware of}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern female fashions which focus on tight clothing and the display of [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] have been attributed to the increase in breast fetishism.&lt;ref name="ggf2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazier|Flowerday|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html secondary sex characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an important aspect of [[femininity]], and many women use [[décolletage]] or a low neckline that exposes cleavage as part of their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]].

Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as well as [[aesthetic]] or [[erotic]]. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's breasts,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.  Saunders, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it may draw attention.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, ''The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths'', Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9780985724931}}&lt;/ref&gt; During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with [[body image]] including breast size and shape.&lt;ref name=Ashlea&gt;Ashlea Worrel, ''An Examination of Women's Body Image and Sexual Satisfaction'', page 15, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549651444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]], [[Wonderbra]] sponsors a [[National Cleavage Day]] during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage.&lt;ref name=WONDERBRA&gt;[https://archive.is/20070406222144/http://www.wonderbra.co.za/nationalcleavageday.aspx "National Cleavage Day"] on Wonderbra.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmansohn |first=Karen |title=The Power of Cleavage |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html  |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered [[toplessness]], considered by some to be [[modesty|immodest]] and in some instances as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|9780792316572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[James Laver]] argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael ''Fashion classics from Carlyle to Barthes'', page 732, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film producers such as [[Russ Meyer]] produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of breast size. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Erica Gavin]], [[Tura Satana]], and [[Uschi Digard]] among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further.&lt;ref name=russmeyer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Russ |others=(Under the pseudonym "Adolph Albion Schwartz") |year=2000 | title=''A Clean Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer'' (3 volume set) |publisher=Hauck Pub Co |location=El Rio, TX |isbn=0-9621797-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and director [[William Rotsler]] said: "with ''Lorna'' Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= McDonough, Jimmy|year=2005| title=''Big bosoms and square jaws : the biography of Russ Meyer, king of the sex film'' | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-224-07250-1}}, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="933">'''Cand.scient.pol.''' (i.e. [[Latin]] ''candidatus/candidata scientiarum politicarum'', also translated into Danish as ''kandidat i statskundskab'',&lt;ref&gt;http://studier.ku.dk/kandidatuddannelser/statskundskab/&lt;/ref&gt; "candidate of political science") is a candidate's degree, viz. an advanced degree, in [[political science]], awarded by several Danish universities. The degree currently requires 5 years of studies, historically 6 years. The current 5-year degree is, since 2009, translated into English as "Master of Science in Political Science".

The equivalent degree used in Norway (until 2008) was called [[cand.polit.]] In Denmark, cand.polit. is a degree in economics.

20% of all members of parliament hold a cand.scient.pol. degree.

[[Greenhouse gas removal]] approaches, of which [[carbon dioxide removal]] represents the most prominent subcategory addresses the cause of global warming by removing [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

Climate engineering approaches are sometimes viewed as additional potential options for limiting [[climate change]] or its impacts, alongside [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is substantial agreement among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for [[climate change mitigation]].

Almost all research into solar radiation management has to date consisted of computer modelling or laboratory tests, and an attempt to move to outdoor experimentation has proven controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-technology-could-cool-the-planet-2017-7 |title=A last-resort ‘planet-hacking’ plan could make Earth habitable for longer – but scientists warn it could have dramatic consequences |author=Kevin Loria |date=July 20, 2017 |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[carbon dioxide removal]] practices, such as [[tree planting|afforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P.| title = Forests and global warming mitigation in Brazil: opportunities in the Brazilian forest sector for responses to global warming under the "clean development mechanism"| journal = Biomass and Bioenergy| last1 = Fearnside| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 171–189| year = 1999| doi = 10.1016/S0961-9534(98)00071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ecosystem restoration and [[bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] projects, are underway to a limited extent. Their scalability to effectively affect global climate is, however, debated. Ocean [[iron fertilization]] has been investigated in small-scale research trials.

Most experts and major reports advise against relying on climate engineering techniques as a main solution to global warming, in part due to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects. However, most experts also argue that the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of risks of dangerous global warming.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite book

Some authors have argued that any public support for climate engineering may weaken the fragile political consensus to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21stcenturychallenges.org/focus/geo-engineering/ |title=Geo-engineering – 21st Century Challenges – Royal Geographical Society with IBG |publisher=21st Century Challenges |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of climate change science}}
The 1965 landmark report, "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment" by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee warned of the harmful effects of fossil fuel emissions, the report also mentioned "deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes," including by "raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/03/geoengineering-a-short-history/|title=Geoengineering: A Short History|year=2013|publisher=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Teller|Teller]] et al. 1997 suggested to research and deploy reflective particles, to reduce incoming solar radiation, and thus to cancel the effects of fossil fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/Teller_etal_LLNL231636_1997.pdf|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|year=1997|title=Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects For Physics-Based Modulation Of Global Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Proposed strategies==
{{See also|List of proposed geoengineering schemes}}
Several climate engineering strategies have been proposed. IPCC documents detail several notable proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg3/176.htm |title=IPCC Third Assessment Report – Climate Change 2001 – Complete online versions &amp;#124; UNEP/GRID-Arendal – Publications – Other |publisher=[[UNEP/GRID-Arendal]] |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031948/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2FCLIMATE%2FIPCC_TAR%2Fwg3%2F176.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fall into two main categories: [[solar radiation management]] and [[carbon dioxide removal]].

===Solar radiation management===
{{Main|Solar radiation management}}
{{See also|Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|Marine Cloud Brightening}}
Solar radiation management (SRM)&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehardlook.typepad.com/thehardlook/files/schnare_supplemental_testimony_a_framework_for_geoengineering.pdf Proposed Outline for Solar Radiation Management (Geoengineering) Framework&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; techniques would seek to reduce sunlight absorbed ([[ultra-violet]], near [[infra-red]] and [[visible light|visible]]).  This would be achieved by deflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or by increasing the reflectivity ([[albedo]]) of the atmosphere or the Earth's surface. These methods would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[atmosphere]], and thus would not seek to address problems such as the [[ocean acidification]] caused by [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, solar radiation management projects presently appear to be able to take effect rapidly and to have very low direct implementation costs relative to greenhouse gas emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Furthermore, many proposed SRM methods would be reversible in their direct climatic effects. While [[greenhouse gas remediation]] offers a more comprehensive possible solution to global warming, it does not give instantaneous results; for that, solar radiation management is required.{{dubious|date=March 2013}}

Solar radiation management methods&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt; may include:
* Surface-based: for example, protecting or expanding polar sea ice and glaciers,&lt;ref&gt;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000410&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Reflective surfaces (geoengineering)|pale-colored roofing materials]], attempting to change the oceans' brightness, or growing high-albedo crops.
* Troposphere-based: for example, [[Cloud reflectivity modification|marine cloud brightening]], which would spray fine [[sea water]] to whiten clouds and thus increase cloud reflectivity.
* Upper atmosphere-based: creating reflective [[aerosols]], such as [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]], specifically designed [[photophoresis|self-levitating]] aerosols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16428.full |title=Photophoretic levitation of engineered aerosols for geoengineering |journal=PNAS |accessdate=2012-05-16 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1009519107 |volume=107 |issue=38 |pages=16428–16431 | last1 = Keith | first1 = D. W.|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716428K |year=2010 |pmc=2944714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other substances. 
* Space-based: [[space sunshade]]—obstructing [[solar radiation]] with space-based mirrors, dust,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bewick | first1 = R. | last2 = Sanchez | first2 = J. P. | last3 = McInnes | first3 = C.

===Carbon dioxide removal===

{{Refimprove|date=June 2013}}[[File:Phytoplankton SoAtlantic 20060215.jpg|upright|thumb|An oceanic [[phytoplankton]] bloom in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Argentina]]. The aim of ocean [[iron fertilization]] in theory is to increase such blooms by adding some iron, which would then draw [[carbon]] from the atmosphere and fix it on the seabed.]]
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Significant reduction in ice volume in the Arctic Ocean in the range between 1979 and 2007]]

Carbon dioxide removal (sometimes known as negative emissions technologies or greenhouse gas removal) projects seek to remove carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]].  Proposed methods include those that directly remove such gases from the atmosphere, as well as indirect methods that seek to promote natural processes that draw down and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g. tree planting).  Many projects overlap with [[carbon capture and storage]] projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators. Techniques in this category include:
* Creating [[biochar]], which can be mixed with soil to create [[terra preta]]
* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] to sequester carbon and simultaneously provide energy
* [[Carbon air capture]] to remove [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air
* [[Afforestation]], [[reforestation]] and [[forest restoration]] to absorb carbon dioxide
* [[Ocean fertilization]] including [[iron fertilization]] of the oceans

Many of the IPCC model projections to keep global mean temperature below 2C, are based on scenarios assuming deployment of negative emissions technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions|title=In-depth: Experts assess the feasibility of ‘negative emissions’|year=2016|publisher=CarbonBrief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise identity of such "tipping points" is not clear, with scientists taking differing views on whether specific systems are capable of "tipping" and the point at which this "tipping" will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchpages.net/ESMG/people/tim-lenton/tipping-points/ |title=Tipping points in the Earth system |publisher=ResearchPages.net |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a previous tipping point is that which preceded the rapid warming leading up to the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. Once a tipping point is crossed, cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will not be able to reverse the change. Conservation of resources and reduction of greenhouse emissions, used in conjunction with climate engineering, are therefore considered a viable option by some commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|title= We're Running the Risk of Unstoppable Climate Change|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|archivedate= 2008-12-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |archivedate=2008-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/global-warming-now-unstoppable-scientists-warn-702979.html | work= The Independent | location=London | title=Global warming now 'unstoppable', scientists warn | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2001-01-23 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buying time===
Climate engineering offers the hope of temporarily reversing some aspects of global warming and allowing the natural climate to be substantially preserved whilst greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control and removed from the [[atmosphere]] by natural or artificial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoengineering could buy the time needed to develop a sustainable energy economy|url = http://thebulletin.org/has-time-come-geoengineering/geoengineering-could-buy-time-needed-develop-sustainable-energy-economy|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Estimates of direct costs for climate engineering implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report ''Geoengineering the Climate'' the [[Royal Society]] judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the "highest affordability" (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D.

Such costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/thinktank/GeoEng_041209.pdf |title=Unilateral Geoengineering |publisher=CFR |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and responsibility===
Climate engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodansky | first1 = D | year = 1996 | title = May we engineer the climate? | url = | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi=10.1007/bf00142579 | bibcode=1996ClCh...33..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social religious commitments.  This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clingerman | first1 = F. | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Playing God: why religion belongs in the climate engineering debate | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1177/0096340214531181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator.  In contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of "stewardship" or benevolent management of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Clingerman, F. (2012) "Between Babel and Pelagius: Religion, Theology and Geoengineering," in Preston, C. (ed.), ''Engineering the Climate: The Ethics of Solar Radiation Management''. Lantham, MD: Lexington, pp. 201–219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.  For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering [[governance]] regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.&lt;ref name = geoengineering_option&gt;Victor, D. G., M. G. Morgan, J. Apt, J. Steinbruner, K. Ricke (2009) "The Geoengineering Option: A last resort against global warming?" ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics ===
It has been argued that regardless of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/12/environment-climate-change-poznan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Let's get real on the environment | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=David | last=Appell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/opinion/24caldiera.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=How to Cool the Globe | first=Ken | last=Caldeira | authorlink=Ken Caldeira | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effective failure of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide [[emissions reduction]] by the agreement of the [[international community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Extreme and risky action the only way to tackle global warming, say scientists | first=David | last=Adam | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of [[global warming skepticism]] and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |title=Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: Geoengineering and the New Climate Denialism |publisher=Worldchanging |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]]&lt;ref name="ETC"&gt;{{cite web|title=ETC website|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/climate-geoengineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals such as [[Raymond Pierrehumbert]] have called for a moratorium on climate engineering techniques.&lt;ref name="worldchanging1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/07/16/can-we-engineer-a-cooler-earth/ ''Can we engineer a cooler earth?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffectiveness===
The effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions. In ocean [[iron fertilization]], for example, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the [[atmosphere]] may be much lower than predicted, as carbon taken up by [[plankton]] may be released back into the atmosphere from dead plankton, rather than being carried to the bottom of the sea and sequestered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Author | first1 =  | year = 2007| title = Seasonal rhythms of net primary production and particulate organic carbon flux to depth describe the efficiency of biological pump in the global ocean | url = | journal = [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] | volume = 112 | issue = | page = C10011 | doi = 10.1029/2006JC003706 | bibcode=2007JGRC..11210011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model results from a 2016 study, suggest that blooming algae could even accelerate Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/algae-accelerate-arctic-warming-18929|title=Blooming Algae Could Accelerate Arctic Warming|year=2016|publisher=ClimateCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2&lt;/ref&gt;  This has generally been called a potential [[Moral Hazard|moral hazard]], although [[risk compensation]] may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss climate engineering for fear of reducing the imperative to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Moral hazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celsias.com/article/geo-engineering-a-moral-hazard/|title=Geo-Engineering – a Moral Hazard|date=14 November 2007|publisher=celsias.com|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertions of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of climate engineering, or of no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

==Governance==
{{See also|Solar radiation management#Governance}}Climate engineering opens up various political and economic issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called "[[free rider problem]]"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the "free driver" problem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049–1068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method. There is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research. The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[List of proposed geoengineering schemes|biomass ocean storage]] and [[ocean fertilization]]. Scientists at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at [[Oxford University]] have proposed a set of voluntary principles, which may guide climate engineering research. The short version of the 'Oxford Principles'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rayner | first1 = S. | last2 = Heyward | first2 = C. | last3 = Kruger | first3 = T. | last4 = Pidgeon | first4 = N. | last5 = Redgwell | first5 = C. | last6 = Savulescu | first6 = J. | title = The Oxford Principles | doi = 10.1007/s10584-012-0675-2 | journal = Climatic Change | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | volume=121 | issue = 3 | pages=499–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:
*Principle 1: Geoengineering to be regulated as a [[public good]].
*Principle 2: Public participation in geoengineering decision-making
*Principle 3: Disclosure of geoengineering research and [[open access publication|open publication]] of results
*Principle 4: Independent assessment of impacts
*Principle 5: Governance before deployment
These principles have been endorsed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology [[Select Committee]] on “The Regulation of Geoengineering”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oxford Geoengineering Programme // History of the Oxford Principles|url = http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/history/|website = www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03|author=Oxford Geoengineering Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been referred to by authors discussing the issue of governance.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15814427 We all want to change the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Asilomar conference]] was replicated to deal with the issue of climate engineering governance,&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; and covered in a [[TV documentary]], broadcast in Canada.

==Implementation issues==
There is general consensus{{Who|date=May 2017}} that no climate engineering technique is currently sufficiently safe or effective to greatly reduce climate change risks, for the reasons listed above. However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.

All proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988|first = National Research|last = Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.

In contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be "implemented" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[public good]]s, whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].

Before they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.

==Public perception==
In a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:
*What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?
*Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?
*Shouldn’t we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?
*Isn’t there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?
Moderators floated then the idea of a future "climate emergency" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of what is known about the suggested techniques is based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modelling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogues in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the 1991 [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modelling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt; and the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialled at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonisation]] of the economy.&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt;

The Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed  methods into "carbon dioxide removal" (CDR) and "solar radiation management" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that "Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions", and that "[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; Nonetheless, the report also recommended that "research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt;

In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that "[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production", and noted that "other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular "ocean pipes" appear to be ineffective".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; They concluded that "[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt;

In October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case "the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html "Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change"], October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Academy of Sciences===
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of  climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management). The differences between these two classes of  climate engineering "led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions."&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{!}} National-Academies.org {{!}} Where the Nation Turns for Independent, Expert Advice|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02102015|website = www8.nationalacademies.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the two-volume study released in February 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. ...Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet’s surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.&lt;ref name="nas-sites.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Climate Intervention Reports » Climate Change at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url = https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/2015-2/climate-intervention-reports/|website = nas-sites.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The project was sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], U.S. Intelligence Community, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[NASA]], and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]].&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49540|title=  Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change===

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) assessed the scientific literature on climate engineering (referred to as "geoengineering" in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19096">The '''compact city''' or '''city of short distances''' is an [[urban planning]] and [[urban design]] concept, which promotes relatively high residential density with mixed land uses. It is based on an efficient public transport system and has an urban layout which – according to its advocates – encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption and reduced pollution. A large resident population provides opportunities for social interaction as well as a feeling of safety in numbers and 'eyes on the street'.&lt;ref name = "jj"&gt;[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961) New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-60047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also arguably a more sustainable urban settlement type than [[urban sprawl]] because it is less dependent on the car, requiring less (and cheaper per capita) infrastructure provision (Williams 2000, cited in Dempsey 2010).&lt;ref name = "nd"&gt;Dempsey, Nicola (2010) Revisiting the Compact City? Built Environment 36(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving a compact city does not just mean increasing [[urban density]] ''per se'' or across all parts of the city. It means good planning to achieve an ''overall'' more compact urban form:
{{quote| Governments of sprawling cities can take many actions to seek a more compact form, often also involving higher densities. Other cities, such as Cairo, with large, dense slum areas, are responding by reducing urban densities in core areas. In either case, limiting outward urban expansion can be combined with more efficient use of land resources and more effective protection of natural resources. City growth can be physically limited in this way through legislated urban growth boundaries, non-urban green belts, and the quarantining of development in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

The term ''compact city'' was first coined in 1973 by [[George Dantzig]] and [[Thomas L. Saaty]],&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, G. B. and Saaty, T. L., 1973, ''Compact City: Plan for a Liveable Urban Environment'', W. H. Freeman, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; two mathematicians whose utopian vision was largely driven by a desire to see more efficient use of resources. The concept, as it has influenced [[urban planning]], is often attributed to [[Jane Jacobs]] and her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name ="jj"/&gt; a critique of [[modern architecture|modernist]] planning policies claimed by Jacobs to be destroying many existing [[inner-city]] communities.

Among other criticisms of the conventional planning and transport planning of the time, Jacobs' work attacked the tendency, inherited from the [[garden city movement]], towards reducing the density of dwellings in urban areas. Four conditions were necessary to enable the diversity essential for [[urban renewal]]: mixed uses, small walkable blocks, mingling of building ages and types, and "a sufficiently dense concentration of people". The 'sufficient' density would vary according to local circumstances but, in general, a hundred dwellings per acre (247 per hectare – high by American standards, but quite common in European and Asian cities) could be considered a minimum.

==The compact city and related concepts==

Although the concept of 'compact city' was coined by American writers, it has been used more in recent years by European and particularly British planners and academics. See, for example, the writings of Michael Jenks.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, M., Burton, E. and Williams, K. (Editors), 1996, ''The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form?'', Spon Press; {{ISBN|0-419-21300-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America the term '[[smart growth]]' has become increasingly common linked to the concept of '[[smart city]]'. The concept of 'smart growth' is very similar to 'compact city', although 'smart growth' carries more strongly normative connotations, implicitly accepting the emphasis in current mainstream debates that growth is necessary and good. The term is often used loosely to accommodate these debates&lt;ref&gt;[ See for example, https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/07/the-countrys-most-ambitious-smart-growth-project/242549/ Kaid Benfield, "The Country's Most Ambitious Smart Growth Project", ''The Atlantic'', July 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognate concepts include 'sustainable urban development' with no presumption that development equals growth.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative concept is 'green urbanism'. [[Steffen Lehmann]] has extensively written about the compact city and green urbanism. His work presents a series of international case studies and outlines 15 core principles for the design of compact, sustainable cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1057; Lehmann, S. (2010) Green urbanism: Formulating a series of holistic principles]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S'' '''3''' (2)''The Principles of Green Urbanism'' (Earthscan, 2010; {{ISBN|978-1-84407-817-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==The compact city, urban sprawl and automobile dependency==

Whether the compact city (or '[[smart growth]]') does or can reduce problems of [[automobile dependency]] associated with [[urban sprawl]] has been fiercely contested over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Petrol use urban density.svg|''Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook'', Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study's methodology has been criticised&lt;ref&gt;MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted – although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense [[suburb]]an and [[exurb]]an residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g910669635 Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)] was entirely devoted to this issue&lt;/ref&gt; people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paradox of intensification==

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour, Melia ''et al.'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of the compact city. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

For example, [[Portland, Oregon]], a U.S. city which has pursued [[smart growth]] policies,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainablefreedomlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-Portlanders-View-of-Smart-Growth.pdf|title=A Portlander’s View of Smart Growth|last=O’TOOLE|first=RANDAL|date=2004|website=Sustainable Freedom Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2017/03/29/portlands-urban-growth-boundary-a-driver-of-suburban-sprawl/#1e8bf28d6964|title=Portland's Urban Growth Boundary: A Driver of Suburban Sprawl|last=Beyer|first=Scott|date=29 March 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:
{{quote|[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.}}

At the city-wide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures, to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.

This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development, positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and [[carfree zone]]s.

== Influence in Europe ==
The [[European Commission]] published the [[Green Paper]] ''Towards a new culture for urban mobility''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0551:EN:NOT Green Paper - Towards a new culture for urban mobility, European Commission, 27 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; on 27 September 2007. Several institutions reacted&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;where=GRP_CITATION:52007DC0551&amp;whereihm=Instruments%20cited:52007DC0551 EU documents mentioning the 2007 European Commission Green Paper – Towards a new culture for urban mobility]&lt;/ref&gt; to the Green Paper among them the European Parliament.

Based on the preparatory work of its Committee on Transport and Tourism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A6-2008-0252&amp;language=EN Draft Report on: Towards a new culture of urban mobility], Motion for a European Parliament resolution, In: 2008/2041(INI). European Parliament, Committee on Transport and Tourism, 27 February 2009, downloaded 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Parliament]] in its Resolution of 9 July 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2008-0356&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A6-2008-0252 European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2008 on "Towards a new culture of urban mobility"]&lt;/ref&gt; called among other things for “drawing up customised sustainable mobility plans and supporting measures for regional and urban planning ('city of short distances'), a process in which all parties concerned should be involved from an early stage”. They referred among others to the EU strategy to combat climate change and other environmental problems.

===Influence in the Netherlands===

The Netherlands' urban planning is highly influenced by the 'compacte stad'. In the 1960s cities expanded in large, top-down planned neighbourhoods using the scarce space available to use as efficiently as possible. Later, cities weren't allowed to expand anyhow, giving way for completely new towns on moderate distances from the main city, in order to keep the new towns influenced mainly by their 'capital', however, giving the towns also some own air. Public transport between the main city and its towns in the rural areas connected them. This policy (''groeikernenbeleid'') resulted in typical commuter towns. Afterwards, in the 1980s, governments decided people need and want to live in this capital city itself and the groeikernenbeleid was rejected. New urban neighbourhoods had to be around a city, as a skin, encircling skins of older neighbourhoods. The new neighbourhoods were cleverly designed, relatively dense and with very good connections to get downtown by public transport or bicycle.

This history results in a lack of urban sprawl, or at least of new urban sprawl. As new neighbourhoods need to be built as an outer skin around existing settlements and as other policies prohibited establishing new settlements outside other towns or villages, no new linear villages could be founded without governmental intervention any more. This in order to keep the rural landscape 'clean' and cities dense and compact.

As a result, in Dutch towns all neighbourhoods are close to city centers, enabling inhabitants to get around quickly and cheaply by bike. Getting out of town doesn't involve driving through ever-ongoing sprawled suburbs, making it easy and popular to visit rural areas. By all these regulations, for instance the [[Groene Hart]] (Green Hart amid the Randstad) is kept green, while buffers around cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] avoids getting the cities grown together entirely.

===Influence in the United Kingdom===

The compact city had a particularly strong influence on planning policy in the UK during the Labour Governments of 1997–2010. The first Labour Government in 1998 set up the Urban Taskforce under [[Richard Rogers|Lord Rogers of Riverside]], which produced the report [[Towards an Urban Renaissance]]. Influenced by this report, the UK Government issued [[PPG 3]] Planning Policy Guidance on Housing which introduced a 60% [[brownfield]] target, a minimum net residential density guideline of 30 dwellings per hectare, a sequential hierarchy beginning with urban [[brownfield land]], maximum parking guidelines replacing the previous minima, and a policy of intensification around public transport nodes. Over the succeeding years, these targets were substantially exceeded, with the brownfield proportion reaching 80% by 2009, and average densities 43 dwellings per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;Land Use Change Statistics (England) 2009 – provisional estimates (July 2010) [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/lucs2009provisionaljuly Department of Communities and Local Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Russia and other ex-Soviet countries ==

Most cities in [[Russia]] such as regional capitals [[Yaroslavl]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Novosibirsk]], etc., as well as cities and towns in other ex [[Eastern Block]] countries (such as [[Trencin]] or [[Zvolen]] in [[Slovakia]]) can be qualified as compact cities, where most people live in residential areas made up of big apartment blocks between 3 to 8 floors, in parks full of trees, flowers, playgrounds, benches, etc. with small shops and cafés on the ground level or in clusters around the main paths. Residents have thus much space to socialize. Cars typically only have limited access to the “inner garden ” that surrounds the apartment blocks and are limited to the main boulevards. The high population density means people have to walk smaller distances to get to the supermarket, school, kindergarten, pub, restaurant, grocery, library, gym, or access the public transportation system – a mix of public buses and tramway and private minibuses. Most people in those cities do not own a car and if they do, they use it only in the summer to drive to their [[dacha]] (cars are typically covered in 2–3 m of snow in winter). Living in apartments also means fewer losses of energy spent on heating, each apartment block having one central heating system in the basement that can be either publicly or privately run.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

'''David S. Muir''' (born 4 January 1971) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] marketing and [[political communications]] professional. He was Director of Political Strategy for [[British prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] between 2008 and 2010.

==Biography==
Muir was born in Falkirk and attended his local comprehensive [[Falkirk High School]]. In 1988 attended the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1992 he graduated with a MA Hons 1st Class in Politics and Economics. He also won the Alistair Reid Prize for Politics for the outstanding study of politics and an ESU Scholarship to work with the US politician [[Byron Dorgan]]. He later graduated from [[London Business School]] with a [[Master of Business Administration]].

==Career==
In 1992 Muir joined the advertising agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], becoming New Business Director until taking a leave of absence to complete his MBA in 1999. In 2001 he returned to Ogilvy where he focussed on expanding the group through organic growth and acquisitions. In 2003 he wrote with Jon Miller ''The Business of Brands'', looking at how businesses could nurture and value their brands.

In 2005 he moved over to [[WPP plc|WPP]] to take over "The Channel" from Mandy Pooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Tylee |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/233834/Muir-takes-Channel/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=Muir takes over at The Channel - advertising news - Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=2005-01-28 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he helped develop WPP's research tool Brandz where he developed the BrandZ Top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.brandrepublic.com/blogs/ritson_on_brand/archive/2006/03/08/millward-brown-optimors-valuation-of-brands.aspx |title=Millward Brown Optimor's Valuation of Brands - Ritson on Brand - Blogs - Brand Republic |publisher=Community.brandrepublic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at The Channel he also developed Sportz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={1ea68e94-3aec-45c4-b8f8-a4dc6928d17e} |title=sports specialist companies launch global sports brands study: SportZ |publisher=WPP |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows global brands to evaluate sponsorship opportunities.

===Downing Street===
In 2008 Muir left WPP to become the British prime minister, [[Gordon Brown]]'s, Director of Political Strategy, replacing [[Spencer Livermore]] who had left&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/536926/team-brown-strengthens.thtml |title=Team Brown strengthens |publisher=The Spectator |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Downing Street Muir was the Prime Ministers leading political adviser after Stephen Carter left. He along with Kirsty McNeill developed Brown's "No time for a novice speech" at the 2008 Labour Party Conference which was "warmly received".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7630567.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; No time for a novice, says Brown |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513035509/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece |date=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir worked closely with [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Philip Gould]] on the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] campaign. He was the lead negotiator of the historic British TV Election Debates and was an early proponent of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418101319/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/election_2010/article7018474.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is believed to have argued for a hard edged attack on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and their threat to middle income earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/15/peter-mandelson-memoirs-brown-economy |title=Peter Mandelson on Brown: 'We were in a pit of debt. And we kept on digging' &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he pushed for the campaign to focus on the threat the Conservative's posed to child tax credits. It is also believed that he supported Gordon Brown's decision not to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/18/gordon-brown-ed-balls-resignation |title=Gordon Brown tried to announce resignation before election &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 18 May 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign denied the Conservatives an overall majority and Muir was part of small team that spent the next five days in discussions with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Muir left Downing Street when Gordon Brown resigned in May 2010.

Discovered by [[Diana Deutsch]] in 1973, '''Deutsch's "scale illusion"''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which principles of grouping by [[frequency]], [[proximity space|proximity]], and spatial [[Sound localization|location]] are put into conflict and in which frequency proximity wins out.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, Albert (1994). ''Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound'', p.76. {{ISBN|0-262-52195-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by simultaneous ascending and descending [[major scale]]s beginning in separate [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] channels with each successive [[note (music)|note]] being switched to the opposite [[stereo channel|channel]]. With the left channel: C'-D-A-F--A-D-C'; and the right: C-B-E-G-E-B-C; the ear hears both: C'-B-A-G--A-B-C'; and: C-D-E-F--E-D-C. The tones are equal-amplitude [[sine wave]]s, and the sequence is played [[repeat sign|repeatedly]] without [[rest (music)|pause]] at a rate of four tones per second. (Listen to the Stereo Sound Example linked below.)

When listening to the illusion over [[headphone]]s, most [[handedness|right-handers]] hear a [[melody]] corresponding to the higher tones as on the right and a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the higher tones continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the higher tones on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. [[Right-handedness|Right-handers]] and [[Left-handedness|left-handers]] differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.

In a clinical study, patients with [[hemispatial neglect]] were shown to experience the scale illusion. Further, in an MEG study on normal listeners the scale illusion was found to be neurally represented at or near the auditory cortex.

According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses?

They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.

[[Personalized medicine]] involves [[Medicine|medical treatments]] based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their [[medical history]], [[family history]], and [[genetics]]. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in [[medical genetics]] among physicians and the general public.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = N.

==Training==
As of 2009, the majority of primary care physicians did not have adequate training in genetics or [[genomics]].&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt; Although medical school curricula typically include medical genetics, fewer than half offer a standalone course, and the emphasis on practical applications is weak.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurston2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thurston | first1 = V.

In the United States, [[Stanford University]] was the first medical school in the United States to offer a course teaching the interpretation of genetic data.&lt;ref name="Roethel2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stanford genotype class asks: What's your type? |author=Kathryn Roethel |url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Stanford-genotype-class-asks-What-s-your-type-3258926.php |newspaper=SFGate |date=July 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were able to study their own [[genotype]]s, determined using commercially available [[Personal genomics|genotyping platforms]] ([[23andMe]] or [[Navigenics]]).&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exposing the Student Body: Stanford Joins U.C.

==Personal genotyping and education==
In 2010, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered entering students a genetic test for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] affecting alcohol, lactose, and folate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DNA education |author= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7300/full/465845b.html |newspaper=Nature |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013 |volume=465 |issue=7300 |doi=10.1038/465845b |pages=845–846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=College bound, DNA swab in hand |author=Tamar Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/education/19dna.html|newspaper=Nature |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was “to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works, the results of the students' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate.”&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"/&gt; However, criticism of the program led to an informational hearing by the California State Committee on Higher Education, and a bill was introduced by [[Chris Norby]] to prevent California state universities from genetically testing their students.&lt;ref name="Gross2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=UC Berkeley DNA testing goes before state committee |author=Rachel Gross |url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/08/11/dna-testing-at-u-c-berkeley-goes-before-state-committee/ |newspaper=Berkeleyside |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genome2010b"&gt;{{cite news |title=California Legislation Seeks to Bar UC Berkeley's Genetic Testing Plans |author= |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/california-legislation-seeks-bar-uc-berkeleys-genetic-testing-plans |newspaper=Genome Web Daily News |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Department of Public Health concluded that the program constituted clinical testing, and the university released only aggregate information instead of personal results.&lt;ref name="NNB2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=State halts UC Berkeley’s gene testing plans |author=Alla Katsnelson |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/08/state_halts_uc_berkeleys_gene_1.html |newspaper=Nature News Blog |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Right Type: Personal Genetic Testing in the Medical School Curriculum |author=Gina Shaw |url=https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb2012/273822/genetic-testing.html |newspaper=AAMC Reporter |date=February 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2010"/&gt; The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">The '''Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law''' Moot is an [[moot court|international moot competition]] for young practicing lawyers organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in [[law school]] or who have not been [[bar (law)|called to the bar]], the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including [[Queen's Counsel]] and [[Senior Counsel]]), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the [[Singapore International Commercial Court]]. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">The acronyms '''ELSI''' (in the United States) and '''ELSA''' (in Europe) refer to research activities that anticipate and address '''''ethical, legal and social implications''''' (ELSI) or '''''aspects''''' (ELSA) of emerging life sciences, notably [[genomics]] and [[nanotechnology]]. ELSI was conceived in 1988 when [[James Watson]], at the press conference announcing his appointment as director of the [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP), suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly declared that the ethical and social implications of genomics warranted a special effort and should be directly funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Deegan, R. 1994/1995. The gene wars: science, politics and the human genome. New York/London: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread ==

Various ELSI or ELSA programs have been developed, in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/ge3ls/&lt;/ref&gt; Europe&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/life/elsa/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshizawa G. et al (2014) ELSI practices in genomic research in East Asia: implications for research collaboration and public participation.

== Features ==

At least four features seem typical for an ELSA approach,&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Nelis A. (2009) What is ELSA genomics? Science and Society Series on convergence research. EMBO Reports 10 (6), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
# proximity (closeness to or embedding in large-scale scientific programs); 
# early anticipation (of societal issues and potential controversies); 
# interactivity (encouraging stakeholders and publics to assume an active role in co-designing research agendas); 
# interdisciplinarity (bridging boundaries between research communities such as for instance [[bioethics]] and STS).

== Reception ==

The ELSA approach has been widely endorsed by academics studying the societal impact of science and technology, but also criticized. Michael Yesley, responsible for the US Department of Energy (DOE) part of the ELSI programme, claims that the ELSI Program was in fact a discourse of justification, selecting topics of ethics research that will facilitate rather than challenge the advance of genetic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Yesley M.S. (2005) What’s ELSI got to do with it? Bioethics and the human genome project. New Genetics and Society 27: 1–6, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ELSA genomics as the handmaiden of genomics research. In Europe, in the context of the [[Horizon 2020]] program, ELSA-style research is now usually framed as [[Responsible Research and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Landeweerd L., Van Rooij A. (2014). Adapt or perish? Assessing the recent shift in the European research funding arena from ‘ELSA’ to ‘RRI’. Life Sciences, Society and Policy. 10:11 (14 May 2014). doi:10.1186/s40504-014-0011-x.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Examples of academic journals open to publishing ELSA research results are ''New Genetics and Society'' (Taylor and Francis) and ''[[Life Sciences, Society and Policy]]'' (SpringerOpen).

In the field of [[waste management]], '''extended producer responsibility''' ('''EPR''') is a strategy designed to promote the integration of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{OECD (2001). ''Extended Producer Responsibility: A Guidance Manual for Governments''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives as it
"focuses on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael R.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Ian P.|date=2014-10-01|title=Product recovery decisions within the context of Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923474813000817|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|series=Engineering and Technology Management for Sustainable Business Development|volume=34|pages=9–28|doi=10.1016/j.jengtecman.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by [[Thomas Lindhqvist]] in a 1990 report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist &amp; Karl Lidgren, "Models for Extended Producer Responsibility," in Sweden, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry, the following definition emerged: "[EPR] is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product, by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life-cycle of the product and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist, "Towards an [EPR]- analysis of experiences and proposals," April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

EPR uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach, which differs from [[product stewardship]], which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Waste to Wealth|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain [[priority product]]s by requiring manufacturers internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based upon the principle that because producers (usually brand owners) have the greatest control over product design and marketing and these same companies have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|title=Producer Responsibility Recycling|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|accessdate=May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111452/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR may take the form of a reuse, buy-back, or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party, a so-called ''producer responsibility organization'' (PRO), which is paid by the producer for used-product management. In this way, EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry, obliging producers, importers and/or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensuring the safe handling of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hanisch, C. (2000). Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?. Environ Sci Technol, 34 (7), pp.170 A-175 A.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example for producer responsibility organizations are the member organizations of PRO EUROPE. PRO EUROPE s.p.r.l. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, is the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO EUROPE are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner.  In many countries, this is done through the [[Green Dot (symbol)|Green Dot]]  trademark of which PRO EUROPE is the general licensor. The Green Dot has evolved into a proven concept in many countries as implementation of Producer Responsibility. In twenty-five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of sales packaging.

==Take-back==

In response to all of the growing problem of excessive waste, several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products' useful life, or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials, or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take-back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all wastes are managed in a way that protects public health and the environment.
The goals of take-back laws are to
#encourage companies to design products for reuse, recyclability, and materials reduction;
#correcting market signals to the consumer by incorporating waste management costs into the product’s price;
#promoting innovation in recycling technology.&lt;ref&gt;James Sallzman, Sustainable Consumption and the Law, 27ENVTL. L. 1274 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
Take-back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to redesign their products to minimize waste management costs, by designing their products to contain safer materials (so they do not need to be managed separately) or designing products that are easier to recycle and reuse (so recycling becomes more profitable).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Roeder, Hazardous Waste: Advocacy Group Recommendations Promote Manufacturer Responsibility, DAILY ENV”T REP., March 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest take-back activity began in Europe, where government-sponsored take-back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on [[WEEE|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)]]. The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/96/EC of 27 January 2003 on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), 203 O.J. (l 37) 46&lt;/ref&gt; These take-back programs have been now adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States, most of these policies have been implemented at the state level, due to the political impasse at the federal level.

== Plastic bags ==

Recycling, banning, and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/24472/epr.pdf|title=Extended Producer Responsibility An examination of its impact on innovation and greening products|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, under the Clinton presidency, the President's Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/EPR.html|title=Proceedings - Extended Product Responsibility|website=clinton2.nara.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can, however, make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market, which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toffel|first=Michael W.|last2=Stein|first2=Antoinette|last3=Lee|first3=Katharine L.|date=2008-01-01|title=Extending Producer Responsibility: An Evaluation Framework for Product Take-Back Policies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hbs/wpaper/09-026.html|publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is banning or taxation of plastic bags, which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States, EPR has not successfully been made mandatory, instead being voluntary.  What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation, producer responsibility, and recycling to combat pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160624090252/https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 24, 2016|title=Public Policy Approaches for the Reduction of Plastic Bag Marine Debris|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics==

Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of [[electronic waste|e-waste]] — used electronics contain materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In 2007, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, people threw away 2.5 million tons of cell phones, TVs, computers, and printers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reagan|first=Robert|date=March 15, 2015|title=A COMPARISON OF E-WASTE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CHINA|url=|journal=Vermont Journal of Environmental Law|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturer Takeback Programs|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronics/manufacturer-takeback-programs/|publisher=Electronics Takeback Coalition|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that local and manufacturer-supported extended producer responsibility laws give manufacturers greater responsibility for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of their own products.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;

The kinds of chemicals found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in the bulbs in flat screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system.  Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer.  Poorer countries are dumping grounds for the United States' e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, 25 states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/wp-content/uploads/Lessons-Learned-from-State-E-waste-laws.pdf|title=Ten Lessons Learned from State E-Waste Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronics TakeBack Coalition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e-waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.productstewardship.us/page/State_EPR_Laws_Map|title=Map of State EPR Laws|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Product Stewardship Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Essentially, these EPR programs have included some driver for increased collection of e-waste, and that is why these states have seen a greater impact on proper e-waste disposal than others. 

Advocates for EPR also argue that including "high expectations for performance" into the laws, and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements, contribute to making the laws successful. In this way, manufacturers can be incentivized to collect more and dispose of e-waste more properly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the larger the scope of products that can be collected, the more e-waste will be disposed of properly.

Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|European Union]] has taken steps to combat the issue of electronic waste management. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/e-waste1.htm|title=How E-waste Works|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|date=|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese laws regarding e-waste are similar to the ones in the EU, but they focus on banning the import of e-waste. This has proven to be difficult, however, because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-million-tons-illegal-e-waste-smuggled-china-each-year-180949930/|title=Eight Million Tons of Illegal E-Waste is Smuggled into China Each Year|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|date=February 28, 2014|website=Smithsonian|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to dispose of e-waste in [[Electronic waste in China|China]] today, a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution.

===Advantages===

When producers either face a financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, they may be incentivized to design more sustainable, less [[electronic waste|toxic]], and easily recyclable electronics.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806123116/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070812124841/http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers' end-of-life costs.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epr"&gt;http://www.eprworkinggroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended producer responsibility is often cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash|first=Bhavani|title=The Light Bulb Conspiracy: The Story of Planned Obsolescence|url=http://www.ecowalkthetalk.com/blog/2011/08/26/the-light-bulb-conspiracy-the-story-of-planned-obsolescence/|publisher=Eco Walk the Talk|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annie Leonard interview &amp; "Story of Electronics" release|url=http://www.nourishthespirit.com/annie-leonard-interview-story-of-electronics-release/|publisher=Nourish the Spirit|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one way to fight [[planned obsolescence]], because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer.

===Disadvantages===
Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle, such as [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium-ion polymer batteries]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility, it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value, such as with CRT televisions, which can contain up to five pounds of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do CRT monitors contain lead?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question678.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; 

Other critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera|first=Ray|title=Mayor Calls Electronics Recycling Bill 'Illegal'|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/mayor-says-hell-ignore-veto-on-electronic-recycling/#comment-39647|work=City Room|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market, by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally-friendly designs because "manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material-use per unit of output, reduced energy use in making and delivering each product, and improved environmental performance."&lt;ref&gt;Gattuso, Dana, and Joel Schwartz. "Extended Producer Responsibility." Reason Foundation. Reason Foundation, 1 June 2002. Web. 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reason Foundation]] argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling, but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials, so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/studies/show/extended-producer-responsibili|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|last=Schwartz|first=Joel|date=June 1, 2002|website=Reason Foundation|publisher=The Reason Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

EPR has been implemented in many forms, which may be classified into three major approaches:
* Mandatory
* Negotiated

It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers' preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries ("on-site" or "direct" allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale, most existing schemes for [[corporate sustainability]] reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company, and not supply-chain impacts&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council on Sustainable Development an World Resources Institute (2001). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Conches-Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this world view, "upstream and downstream [environmental] impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors' spheres of influence are not reflected".&lt;ref&gt;Spangenberg, J. H. and S. Lorek (2002). Environmentally sustainable household consumption: from aggregate environmental pressures to priority fields of action. Ecological Economics, 43, pp. 127-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence, especially in the industrialised world, are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer-focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption-related aspects, demand-side measures to environmental problems are rarely exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, T. (1999). Consumption and environment: some conceptual issues. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;Munksgaard, J. and K. A. Pedersen (2001). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accounts for open economies: producer or consumer responsibility. Energy Policy, 29, pp. 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Environmental Protection Agency (1998). Denmark's Second National Communication on Climate Change submitted under the UN FCCC. [http://www.mst.dk Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, at the company level, "when adopting the concept of eco-efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO 14001, it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company".&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. and L. Karlson (2002). Business incentives for sustainability: a property rights approach. Ecological Economics, 40, pp. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 "Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life-cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start."&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. (2005) Environmental Strategies in Industry: Turning Business Incentives into Sustainability. Report 5455. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; A life-cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks: "Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility (physical and/or financial) not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product, but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products."&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2001, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; "The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they were facing severe landfill shortages. [... As a result,] EPR is generally applied to post-consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management."&lt;ref&gt;Environment Protection Authority New South Wales 2003, p. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover, applying conventional [[life cycle assessment]], and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to [[Double counting (accounting)|double-counting]]. Using [[input-output analysis]], researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers' supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gallego, B. and M. Lenzen (2005). A consistent input-output formulation of shared producer and consumer responsibility. Economic Systems Research, 17(4), pp. 365-391.&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain – producers and consumers.

==Examples==

Auto Recycling Nederland (ARN) is a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) that organises vehicle recycling in the [[Netherlands]]. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union's [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]].

The Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology (SWICO), an ICT industry organisation, became a PRO to address the problem of [[electronic waste]].

The Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (CAP-EPR) was adopted in Canada in 2009 under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP-EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts, Canada fell short of many other [[Group of Eight|G8]] and [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/current_priorities/waste/pn_1499_epr_cap_e.pdf|title=Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=October 2009|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the CAP-EPR’s 2009 inception, most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. “Nine out of ten provinces have [since implemented] EPR programs or [put] requirements in place… As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones, almost half of the product categories for Phase 1 are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/extended/CAP-EPR%20Progress%20Report.pdf|title=Progress Report on the Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extender Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

In Germany, since the adoption of EPR, "between 1991 and 1998, the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from 94.7 kg to 82 kg, resulting in a reduction of 13.4%".&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"&gt;Hanisch, Carola. "Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?" Environmental Science &amp; Technology 34.7 (2000): 170A-75A. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to Germany's influence in EPR, the "European Commission developed one waste directive" for all of member states (Hanisch 2000). One major goal was to have all member states recycle "25% of all packaging material"&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"/&gt; and have accomplished the goal.

In the United States, EPR is gaining popularity "with 40 such laws enacted since 2008. In 2010 alone, 38 such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States, and 12 were signed into law."&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. "Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States." ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' 17.2 (2013): 175-85. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these laws are only at the state level as there are no federal laws for EPR. So far, "only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as 32 states having at least one EPR law".&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"/&gt;

'''Genetic engineering''', also called '''genetic modification''' or '''genetic manipulation''', is the direct manipulation of an organism's [[gene]]s using [[biotechnology]]. It is a set of [[Genetic engineering techniques|technologies]] used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]]. New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[recombinant DNA]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesising]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [[SV40]] with the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]]. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]].

An organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMO was a [[Genetically modified bacterium|bacterium]] generated by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1973. [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human [[insulin]] was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. [[Genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994, with the release of the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 [[AquAdvantage salmon|salmon]] modified with a growth hormone were sold.

Genetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create [[Model organism|animal model organisms]] of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through [[gene therapy]]. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.

The rise of commercialised [[genetically modified crops]] has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversy]] surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a [[scientific consensus]] that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. [[Gene flow]], impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and [[intellectual property]] rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.

Genetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]]. Unlike traditional [[animal husbandry|animal]] and [[plant breeding]], which involves doing multiple crosses and then selecting for the organism with the desired [[phenotype]], genetic engineering takes the [[gene]] directly from one organism and inserts it in the other. This is much faster, can be used to insert any genes from any organism (even ones from different [[Domain (biology)|domains]]) and prevents other undesirable genes from also being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-does-gm-differ-from-conventional-plant-breeding/|title=How does GM differ from conventional plant breeding?|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the 1970s.

==Process==
{{main|Genetic engineering techniques}}
[[File:Master Mix with Primers form PCR.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polymerase chain reaction]] is a powerful tool used in [[molecular cloning]]]]
Creating a GMO is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert into the organism. This is driven by what the aim is for the resultant organism and is built on earlier research. [[Genetic screen]]s can be carried out to determine potential genes and further tests then used to identify the best candidates. The development of [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[transcriptomics]] and [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] has made it much easier to find suitable genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWJ1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=genetic+engineering+screen+to+find+target+genes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ExTec5lWP4&amp;sig=9jiW3UGkfeN82RHwW5H5weFHwF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqkfmup8nTAhXKmpQKHVWMAiQQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=genetic%20engineering%20screen%20to%20find%20target%20genes&amp;f=false|title=Current Technologies in Plant Molecular Breeding: A Guide Book of Plant Molecular Breeding for Researchers|last=Koh|first=Hee-Jong|last2=Kwon|first2=Suk-Yoon|last3=Thomson|first3=Michael|date=2015-08-26|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9789401799966|location=|pages=242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luck also plays its part; the round-up ready gene was discovered after scientists noticed a bacterium thriving in the presence of the herbicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/how-to-make-a-gmo/|title=How to Make a GMO - Science in the News|date=2015-08-09|work=Science in the News|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene isolation and cloning ===
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
The next step is to isolate the candidate gene. The [[Cell (biology)|cell]] containing the gene is opened and the DNA is purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1v6WMHVkTgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Genetic+Engineering:+Principles+and+Methods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimxYGunsnTAhWBspQKHThtDYcQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Genetic%20Engineering:%20Principles%20and%20Methods&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering|last=Nicholl|first=Desmond S.

Before the gene is inserted into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region, which initiate and end [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. A [[selectable marker]] gene is added, which in most cases confers [[antibiotic resistance]], so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using [[recombinant DNA]] techniques, such as [[restriction digest]]s, ligations and molecular cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.112144 |title=Personal Reflections on the Origins and Emergence of Recombinant DNA Technology |year=2010 |last1=Berg |first1=P. |last2=Mertz |first2=J.

===Inserting DNA into the host genome===
{{Main|Gene delivery}}
[[File:Genegun.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A gene gun uses [[biolistics]] to insert DNA into plant tissue]]
There are a number of techniques available for inserting the gene into the host genome. Some bacteria can naturally [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]]. This ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress (e.g. [[heat shock|thermal]] or electric shock), which increases the cell membrane's permeability to DNA; up-taken DNA can either integrate with the genome or exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using [[microinjection]], where it can be injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or through the use of [[viral vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=I |last2=Dubnau |first2=D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat.

The new genetic material can be inserted randomly within the host genome or targeted to a specific location. The technique of [[gene targeting]] uses [[homologous recombination]] to make desired changes to a specific [[endogenous]] gene.  This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of [[selectable markers]]. The frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced through [[genome editing]]. Genome editing uses artificially engineered [[nuclease]]s that create specific [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]]  at desired locations in the genome, and use the cell’s endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by the natural processes of [[homologous recombination]] and [[Nonhomologous end joining|nonhomologous end-joining]].

== Applications ==

Genetic engineering has applications in medicine, research, industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants, animals and micro organisms. [[Bacteria]], the first organisms to be genetically modified, can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Genetic Modification of Bacteria|publisher=[[Annenberg Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panesar, Pamit et al (2010) "Enzymes in Food Processing: Fundamentals and Potential Applications", Chapter 10, I K International Publishing House, {{ISBN|978-9380026336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtraitslist/default.asp|title=GM traits list|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant or herbicide tolerant crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43-2011: Executive Summary|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products.

Genetic engineering is an important tool for [[natural scientists]]. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification, creating [[genetically modified bacteria]] in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80&amp;nbsp;°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Rediscovering Biology - Online Textbook: Unit 13 Genetically Modified Organisms|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes. This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.

* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called "scanning mutagenesis". The simplest method, and the first to be used, is "alanine scanning", where every position in turn is mutated to the unreactive amino acid [[alanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycVoWFqDTmAC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Protein Engineering and Design|last=Park|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Cochran|first2=Jennifer R.|date=2009-09-25|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420076592|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gain of function experiments''', the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed. Expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins; this process is known as [[promoter bashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ed4_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=genetically+engineering+%22promoter+bashing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lBHJ-WRplM&amp;sig=9_Ai3toQAWmYrZGin9_bw3_0_QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5qIeMueDVAhUDU7wKHcdJBhIQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically%20engineering%20%22promoter%20bashing%22&amp;f=false|title=Techniques in Genetic Engineering|last=Kurnaz|first=Isil Aksan|date=2015-05-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781482260908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms can have their cells transformed with a gene coding for a useful protein, such as an enzyme, so that they will [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|overexpress]] the desired protein.

One of the best-known and [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversial]] applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified livestock]] to produce [[genetically modified food]].

==Controversy==

{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies|}}

Critics have objected to the use of genetic engineering on several grounds, that include ethical, ecological and economic concerns. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Ian M.|date=2002-03-01|title=Regulation of biotechnology: will we ever ‘freely’ trade GMOs?|url=https://academic.oup.com/erae/article-abstract/29/1/155/558037/Regulation-of-biotechnology-will-we-ever-freely|journal=European Review of Agricultural Economics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=155–176|doi=10.1093/erae/29.1.155|issn=0165-1587|citeseerx=10.1.1.596.7670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

Beside individual works linked to traditional techniques, the members proposed different concepts and forms of artistic communication, ran a gallery and published the "anti-magazine" ''Gorgona''. In each issue they featured one artist's work such as [[Dieter Roth]] or [[Julije Knifer]]. Works by the Gorgona Group are widely represented in a number of institutions in Croatia including, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]], the [[Filip Trade Collection]] and the [[Marinko Sudac Collection]].

The '''History Aptitude Test''' ('''HAT''') is a [[standardized test]] used as part of the admissions process to [[Oxford University]] for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.

The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.

==Criticism==
In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the [[Secondary Heads Association]] complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/oct/11/accesstouniversity.highereducation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multitrack recording]] of sound is the process in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as [[magnetic tape]], which is divided into two or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating [[stereophonic sound]] (using [[telephone]] technology) was demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] in Paris in 1881. The [[pallophotophone]], invented by [[Charles A. Hoxie]] and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/edison-speaks-cracking-the-pallophotophone-code/ Edison speaks! Cracking the pallophotophone code | GE Reports&lt;!-- bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later [[Audio mixing|mixdown]] or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British [[EMI]] engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and [[surround sound]] on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of [[stereo]] tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.

The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the [[Ampex]] corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its "Sel-Sync" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician [[Les Paul]]&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;[http://aes-media.org/historical/pdf/snyder_sel-sync.pdf ARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings#Indexing yearly income|US average yearly income]] in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM [[Portastudio]], which used the inexpensive [[compact audio cassette]] as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like [[GarageBand]] were being included as a standard feature on home computers.

==Overview==
Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the [[AEG]] corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and the [[Ampex]] corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity ("HiFi") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]]. But it was [[Patti Page]] who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called [[Confess_(song)|'Confess']], in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded [[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]], an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.

Despite [[Ampex]] having created the first 8-track tape machines for [[Les Paul]] and [[Atlantic Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/Remembering_Ahmet_Ertegun_and_Atlantics_Early_Years |title=Remembering Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic’s Early Years |publisher=BMI|date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early [[Motown]] hits — were taped on 3-track recorders.

The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]] to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist [[Carl Wilson]] was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". For the group's landmark ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member [[Bruce Johnston]]), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'' (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 ''magnum opus'', ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also led to a related development, [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and Mike Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the [[surround sound]] technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.

In a [[professional audio]] setting today, such as a [[recording studio]], [[audio engineer]]s may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of [[magnetic tape]] as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on [[magnetic tape]], then transferred to disc, with [[Bing Crosby]] leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

== Ampex's original 8-track recorder ==

The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with [[8-track tape]] endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.  It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics.  It stood over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.  8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of {{convert|0.070|in|mm}} recording tracks with {{convert|0.060|in|mm}} guard tracks that would fit on a {{convert|1|in|mm}} recording tape, the widest tape available at the time.&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt;

The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to [[Les Paul]] for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by [[David Sarser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reevesaudio.com/studiothree.html Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It became known as the "Octopus".

The second Ampex model 5258 8-track was sold to [[Atlantic Records]] at [[Tom Dowd|Tom Dowd's]] insistence in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/arts/tom-dowd-77-an-innovator-in-the-art-of-recording-music.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tom Dowd, 77, an Innovator In the Art of Recording Music | date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or 3-track) recorder in their studio.

== Multi-channel recorders ==

Multi-track recording differs from [[overdubbing]] and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks.  Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.

Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks.  The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.

The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. [[Elvis Presley]] was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as [[RCA]]'s engineers were testing their new machines. [[Buddy Holly]]'s last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.

== Other early multi-track recorders ==

[[Frank Zappa]] experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built 5-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]]. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer [[Joe Meek]] produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=Barry|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques|date=2013|publisher=ElevenEleven|isbn=978-0-615-73600-6|pages=121|edition=Second|url=http://www.barrycleveland.com/jm-about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Meek, [[EMI]] house producer [[George Martin]] was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; [[Abbey Road Studios]] installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but [[The Beatles]] would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single ''[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]'' (1964) were made on two-track machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Recording The Beatles |last= Kehew |first= Brian |publisher= Curvebender Publishing |author2=Kevin Ryan |pages= 216 |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-9785200-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on popular music==

The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.

The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. [[Brian Wilson]] pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '[[overdubbing|dubbed down]]' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.

[[3M]] introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format.  It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London.  Both [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Lennon]] had 3M 8-track machines in their home [[project studio]]s c. 1969-1970.  Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967.  One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by [[Scully Recording Instruments]] of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967.  The [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|debut album]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] was recorded there and was released in January 1968.

Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used [[vari-speed]] (also called [[pitch shift]]) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the [[Automatic Double Tracking]] (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer [[Ken Townsend]] in 1966.

Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with [[the Music Machine]] (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and [[Pink Floyd]] collaborating with former Beatles [[recording engineer]] [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], who produced their first albums.

The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's [[Advision Studios]] in early 1968.  Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single ''[[Dogs (The Who song)|Dogs]]'' by [[The Who]] and the album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows]]'' by the band [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  [[Trident Studios]] obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward.  It was during The Beatles' recording of their ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' sessions of late 1968 that [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks.  The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of  the ''White Album'', the single "[[Hey Jude]]" and the later ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in [[Australia]], the largest local recording label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s.

==Large format analog recorders==

In 1967 [[Ampex]] built its first prototype 16-track [[professional audio]] recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City.  This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built  for video recording.  In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine.  Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain.  Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars.

One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in [[New York City]] where it was used to record the second album by ''[[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)|Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]'' released in December 1968.  The [[Grateful Dead]] released their first 16-track recordings ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' in June 1969 and ''[[Live/Dead]]'' in November 1969.  TTG Studios in [[Los Angeles]] built its own 16-track machine in 1968.  This was used on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' released in October 1969. ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' by [[Jefferson Airplane]] was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.

Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the [[Van der Graaf Generator]] album ''[[The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other]]'', was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971.  By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with [[Dolby]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on London" Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - advertisement, pg. L-26&lt;/ref&gt; Groups using Trident at this time also included [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[David Bowie]] as well as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums [[Queen II]] and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at [[Armstrong's Studios]] in [[Melbourne]] in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974.  During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.  The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using [[hard disk drive]]s instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.

Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by [[Music Center Incorporated|MCI]] in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] made a 32 track 2" MX-80.  A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.  Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available.  New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.

[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¼ inch tape.]]

==Home systems==

In 1972 [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] marketed their consumer 4-channel [[quadraphonic]] tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders.  The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models.  Both used ¼ inch tape.  The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second and used 10½ inch reels.  The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.

The advent of the [[compact audio cassette]] (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the [[Tascam]] [[Portastudio]] which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as [[reel-to-reel]] machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making [[demo (music)|song demos]]. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging [[punk rock]] genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a [[record label]]. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground [[zine]]s. [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen's]] 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.

The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, [[effect unit|electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]] are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).

[[File:Alesis-HD24.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alesis HD24 stand-alone multitrack hard disk recorder.]]

==Digital multitracking==

By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of [[pulse code modulation]], also called PCM [[digital recording]], for [[high fidelity]] purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]]. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in "real time" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.

By the late 1970s, [[3M]] introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit "word" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&amp;nbsp;kHz). It was known to be the best sounding{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2018}} of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz for CD's &amp; 48&amp;nbsp;kHz for digital video.

The accepted world standard was created by [[Sony]] along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the [[dynamic range]] and [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital [[drum machine]]s and inexpensive analog [[audio mixer]]s introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function [[remote control]] was also available.

The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for [[overdubbing]] purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
[[File:Korg D888.jpg|right|thumb|Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder]]
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the [[classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] and [[Windows operating system]]s in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US &amp; Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as [[ADAT]]), or in some cases [[Minidisc]]s.

Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were [[Tascam]] (hard drive or cassette based), [[Alesis]] (ADAT digital tape based), [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]/[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] (hard drive based), [[Fostex]] (hard drive based), [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] (hard drive based), and [[Korg]].

A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.

== Computer-based recording ==

The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history]&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the platform upon which [[Pro Tools]] was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of [[Cubase]] Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to [[MIDI]] sequencing capabilities.

While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that in the 2010s, a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a [[sound card]] adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software [[GarageBand]] is offered as a free download for all of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] new computers or $4.99 for older models.  GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware.  In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.  In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on the Windows for around $50 to $100.  After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects.

In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many [[singer-songwriter]]s to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

'''Hungarian Templeton Program''' is a unique pilot program taking place between 15/09/2015 and 28/02/2017. The main purpose of the program is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group.

==John Templeton Foundation==
[[Sir John Templeton]] (1912-2008) was strongly committed to supporting research in science, theology, philosophy and the social sciences. One of the main goals of his endeavors was to contribute to understanding the fundamental underlying principles of the universe and to building a better society on the ethical, intellectual and spiritual levels. 
He founded the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1987, which also includes the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]]. The TWCF chooses which initiatives it funds and does not accept unsolicited proposals. In accordance with the testamentary provisions of [[Sir John Templeton]] , it supports worthy programs which seek answers to the "big questions" and challenges of life and the universe. As well, it provides assistance to persons with exceptional cognitive talent who contribute to the flourishing of humanity.

==Hungarian Templeton Program==
This program is implemented with the funding and the support of the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]] and of the [[European Social Fund]] as co-sponsor. The program's advisory partner is the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations ([[:hu:Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége|Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége]] - MATEHETSZ).
Launched on September 15, 2015 and lasting until February 28, 2017, the Hungarian Templeton Program is a unique pilot program whose main objective is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group. Using a new methodology specifically designed for this purpose, program staff will identify 300 Hungarian youth with exceptional cognitive talents (Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows) as well as 150 disadvantaged children aged 5–8 with exceptional cognitive talents.

The aim of the program is to bring together a creative community and network of exceptionally talented people whose members will, with the assistance of top-performing contemporary personalities, prepare themselves to take on the momentous task of becoming the leaders, thinkers and entrepreneurs of Hungary and Europe in the decades ahead.

A customized one-year talent support program will be developed for each of the selected talented youth (the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows). The program also devotes special attention to underprivileged children aged 5–8. It uses a unique talent testing procedure created for this age group, as well as a talent development program consisting of workshop sessions over a period of several days.

The program also offers assistance to talented youth identified during the selection process but not chosen as Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows by offering them access to the ESF "Talents for Hungary" enrichment programs also supported by the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (MATEHETSZ).

==Selection process==
The 300 Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows are to be selected using objective scientific criteria and a new methodology. Selection will involve tests measuring aptitudes in a number of areas.

===For talented youth aged 10-19===
IQ test, vocabulary, problem solving, working memory, motivation and creativity.

===For talented youth aged 20-29===
IQ test, evaluation of achievements and productivity based on a motivation letter, activities thus far, level of interest and an introductory presentation or video.

==Program framework==
Cognitive talents selected for the program – the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows – will each benefit from a one-year customized talent support package. Each young person will receive one-on-one mentoring from prominent Hungarian scientists and entrepreneurs who make up the program's roster of mentors. 
Elements of the support program include '''[[e-learning]]; [[coaching]]; [[personality development]]; [[Business networking|networking]]; development of communication, [[linguistic]], computer, [[research]], [[innovation]], financial and entrepreneurial skills; assistance in choosing a career path in a context of [[social responsibility]].'''
 
In addition to supporting skill development in specific areas, the program places especial emphasis on encouraging Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows to use their aptitudes and knowledge responsibly for the '''good of society'''.

==Program content==
Based on their individual needs and the options available in the program, Junior Fellows will receive a personalized talent support package which may include:

* Participation in scientific research and development projects 
* Familiarization with research centers, cases and practices in both scientific and business contexts
* Scholarships
* International travel (competitions, camps, conferences)
* Business trainings (e.g. Lean, Start-up)
* [[LinkedIn]], Everyday Heroes and PREZI trainings
* Public speaking and presentation-making trainings
* Language learning opportunities 
* Familiarization with case studies in a business context
* Soft skill trainings 
* Activities to develop social responsibility
* Drafting business plans, support for start-ups 
* Support for social entrepreneurs (Ashoka) 
* Participation in national and international talent day events 
* Innovation camp

==Post-program opportunities==
This pilot program is for one year, and is expected to continue in [[Hungary]] and serve as a model for expansion into other countries in versions adapted to regional cultural differences. Talented youth selected for the program will be monitored and assisted for a few years after the end of the program by the ongoing network of contacts in the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow Network.

==Mentoring==
Substantive support for the Program is provided by our network of mentors: scientists, researchers, experts and businesspeople who have shown exceptional levels of achievement in their fields and careers. Mentoring is a crucial element of the program and a mentor will be assigned to every Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow.

[[File:Fra Carnevale - The Ideal City - Walters 37677.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Ideal City'' by [[Fra Carnevale]], c. between 1480-1484.]]
An '''ideal city''' is the concept of a [[City planning|plan]] for a [[city]] that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.

==Concept==
The "ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the [[moral]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[juridical]] qualities of [[citizenship]] as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc.  The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town planning) or other geometrical patterns.  The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy [[Utopian]] ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as [[St Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].

==History==
[[File:Formerly_Piero_della_Francesca_-_Ideal_City_-_Galleria_Nazionale_delle_Marche_Urbino_2.jpg|thumb|350px|The ideal city attributed to [[Luciano Laurana]] or [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the [[Renaissance]], and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of [[Plato]], whose ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'.   The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilisation]], sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.

==Examples==
[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan of [[Sforzinda]], Filarete, c. 1465]]
[[Image:Palmanova1600.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Palmanova]] in 1593. The town is encircled by massive [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Venetian Defensive Systems]] that are a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Examples of the ideal cities include [[Filarete]]'s "[[Sforzinda]]", a description of which was included in his ''Trattato di Architettura'' (c. 1465).  The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular [[moat]].  Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called "Urbino" and "Baltimore" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show [[Classical architecture|Classically]] influenced architecture disposed in logically planned [[piazza]]s. The cities of [[Palmanova]] and [[Nicosia]], whose [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Ventian Fortess]] were built in the 1590s by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable example of the concept is [[Zamość]] in eastern [[Poland]] founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect [[Bernardo Morando]].

[[James Oglethorpe]] synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the [[Province of Carolina]]. The physical design component of the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]] remains preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the [[Garden city movement]] of Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]], realised at [[Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in England.  [[Poundbury]], [[Prince Charles]]' architectural vision established in [[Dorset]], is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.

Baltrušaitis was born in [[Moscow]]. During his childhood he was immersed in the intense cultural life of his parents. One of his first teachers was the Russian poet and writer [[Boris Pasternak]].

In 1924 he moved to [[Paris]] and began theater studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] under the guidance of Professor [[Henri Focillon]]. Under his influence Baltrušaitis chose to study the history of art. He went on to do research in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]], receiving a [[doctorate]] from the Sorbonne in 1931. Later that year he became the cultural attache at the Lithuanian Legation in Paris.

Between 1933 and 1939 Baltrušaitis taught art history at the University of Kaunas, as well as lecturing at the Sorbonne and at the [[Warburg Institute]] in [[London]].

After [[World War II]] he delivered lectures at [[New York University]], [[Yale University]], [[Harvard University]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

His diplomatic efforts included writing for the French press on Lithuanian issues, and representing Lithuania in international organizations such as the ''Académie Internationale des Sciences et des Lettres'' and the Lithuanian Legation in Paris.

Baltrušaitis died in Paris.

'''Leadership studies''' is a [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] academic field of study that focuses on [[leadership]] in organizational contexts and in human life. Leadership studies has origins in the [[social science]]s (e.g., [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]]), in [[humanities]] (e.g., [[history]] and [[philosophy]]), as well as in professional and applied fields of study (e.g., [[management]] and [[education]]). The field of leadership studies is closely linked to the field of [[organizational studies]].

As an academic area of inquiry, the study of leadership has been of interest to scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Today, there are numerous academic programs (spanning several academic colleges and departments) related to the study of leadership. Leadership degree programs generally relate to: aspects of leadership, leadership studies, and organizational leadership (although there are a number of leadership-oriented concentrations in other academic areas).

==Leadership in higher education==

Leadership has become one of the fastest-growing academic fields in higher education&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite journal | last1 = Brungardt | first1 = C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among some of the more established and traditional academic disciplines such as [[engineering]], [[education]], and [[medicine]], specialization and concentration areas have developed around the study of leadership. Most of these academic programs have aimed to be [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] in nature—drawing upon theories and applications from related fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[management]]. Such an approach, Rost (1991) has argued "allows scholars and practitioners to think radically new thoughts about leadership that are not possible from a unidisciplinary approach" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="Rost"/&gt;

==History of leadership as a field of study==

The study of [[leadership]] can be dated back to [[Plato]], [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]; however, leadership has only become the focus of contemporary academic studies in the last 60 years, and particularly more so in the last two decades. Contemporary leadership scholars and researchers have often been questioned about the nature of their work, and its place within the academy, but much of the confusion surrounding leadership as a field of study may be attributed to a lack of understanding regarding [[transdisciplinary studies|transdisciplinary]], [[Interdisciplinary|inter-, and multi- disciplinary]] academic fields of study in general.

The discipline (which encompasses a host of sub-fields) is filled with definitions, theories, styles, functions, competencies, and historical examples of successful and diverse leaders. Collectively, the research findings on leadership provide a far more sophisticated and complex view of the phenomenon than most of the simplistic views presented in the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doh | first1 = J. P | year = 2003 | title = Can leadership be taught? Perspectives from management educators | url = | journal = Academy of Management Learning and Education | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 54–67 | doi = 10.5465/AMLE.2003.9324025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daloz Parks, S. (2005). ''Leadership can be taught: A bold approach for a complex world''. Cambridge: Harvard Business School Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest studies on leadership include:

:* The [[Ohio State leadership|Ohio State Leadership Studies]] which began in the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on how leaders could satisfy common group needs.  The findings indicated that the two most important dimensions in leadership included: "initiating structure", and "consideration". These characteristics could be either high or low and were independent of one another.  The research was based on questionnaires to leaders and subordinates. These questionnaires are known as the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) and the Supervisor Behavior Description Questionnaire (SBDQ).&lt;ref&gt;The Ohio State University (n.d.). Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) {{cite web |url=http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407022713/http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, the LBDQ was on version XII.

The Leadership Box (Northern Michigan State University) http://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/behaviors.htm#katz_michigan&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., Maccoby, N., and Morse, N. 1950. ''Productivity, Supervision, and Morale in an Office Situation''. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicated that leaders could be classified as either "employee centered," or "job centered."  These studies identified three critical characteristics of effective leaders: task oriented behavior, relationship-oriented behavior, and participative leadership.

:* [[Theory X and theory Y|McGregors Theory X &amp; Theory Y]] developed by [[Douglas McGregor]] in the 1960s at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. These theories described employee motivation in the workforce. Both theories begin with the premise that the role of management is to assemble the factors of production, including people, for the economic benefit of the firm. Beyond this point, the two theories of management diverge.

:* Blake &amp; Mouton Managerial Grid (1964) – updated in 1991 to the Blake &amp; McCanse Leadership Grid-developed the orientation of "task orientation" and "people orientation" in leader behavior. They developed the leadership grid which focused on concern for results (on the one axis) and concern for people (on the other axis).

In addition to these studies, leadership has been examined from an academic perspective through several [[Leadership|theoretical lenses]]:

:* [[Leadership#Trait Theory|Trait &amp; behavioral theories of leadership]]: Attempt to describe the types of behavior and personality tendencies associated with effective leadership.

:* [[Leadership#Situational and contingency theories|Situational &amp; contingency theories of leadership]]: Incorporate environmental and situational considerations into leader behavior.

:* [[Leadership#Functional theory|Functional leadership theory]]: Suggests that a leader’s primary responsibility is to see that whatever is necessary in relation to group needs is taken care of.

:* [[Information processing|Information-Processing]] Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Lord, R. (1994). ''Leadership and Information Processing: Linking Perceptions and Performance (People and Organizations)'' https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Information-Processing-Perceptions-Organizations/dp/0415099013&lt;/ref&gt; Focuses on the role of social perception in identifying leadership abilities.

:* Self Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Neck, C. P., &amp; Houghton, J. D. (2006). Two decades of self-leadership theory and research: Past developments, present trends, and future possibilities. ''Journal of Managerial Psychology'' http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1554367&lt;/ref&gt; Although behaviorally oriented, the essence of self leadership theory is that behaviors are directed toward the attainment of super-ordinate goals.

:* [[Leadership#Transactional and transformational theories|Transactional &amp; Transformational theories of Leadership]]: The transactional leader focuses on managerial reward and [[contingent valuation]]. The transformational leader focuses on motivation and goal attainment.

* Ambidextrous leadership
* Democratic Leadership
* [[Innovation leadership]]
* [[Transactional leadership]]
* [[Transformational leadership]]

==Research methods in the study of leadership==

Leadership has been studied using [[Quantitative methods|quantitative]], [[Qualitative research|qualitative]], and mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative) research methodologies. From a [[quantitative psychology]] orientation, statistical and mathematical modeling has been used in the development of leadership scales, in testing established leader evaluation tools, and in examining perceptions of leaders.&lt;ref&gt;See Hoyt, C. L.; Murphy, S. (2016). “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984315001332 Managing to clear the air: Stereotype threat, women, and leadership].” ''The Leadership Quarterly'', '''27''' (3): 387–399.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative analysis may also take an experimental approach, incorporating methods from the field of [[experimental economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See Levy, D. M.; Padgitt, K.; Peart, S. J.; Houser, D.; Xiao, E. (2011). “[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Levy15/publication/228753699_Leadership_cheap_talk_and_really_cheap_talk/links/0912f506cd1dead56e000000.pdf Leadership, cheap talk and ''really'' cheap talk].” ''Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization'' '''77''': 40–52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Survey research|Survey methodology]] has also been widely used in leadership research. As such, traditional methods of analysis in survey research have also extended to the analysis of survey research within the study of leadership (e.g., [[Cross tabulation|cross-tabulations]], [[Analysis of variance|ANOVAs]], [[regression analysis]], [https://archive.is/20121212070319/http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/logit.htm log-linear analysis], [[factor analysis]], etc.). From a qualitative orientation, leadership research has included a host of research techniques: [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[ethnography]],&lt;ref&gt;See von Rueden, C.; van Vugt, M. (2015). “[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690906 Leadership in small-scale societies: some implications for leadership evolution and practice].” ''The Leadership Quarterly'', '''26''': 978-990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grounded theory]], [[interviews]], [[case studies]], [[Historical analysis|historiography]],&lt;ref&gt;See Hayter, J. M. (2015). “[http://scholarship.richmond.edu/jolpi/vol18/iss4/6/ To End Divisions: Reflections on the Civil Rights Act of 1964]." ''Richmond Journal of Law and Public Interest'' '''18''' (4): 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Bezio, K.B. (forthcoming). “[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742715016663753 From Rome to Tyre to London: Shakespeare’s ''Pericles'', leadership, anti-absolutism, and English exceptionalism].” ''Leadership''.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

"Coaches and coaching psychologists are increasingly using the lessons and
tools of positive psychology in their practice (Biswas-Diener, 2010)."  An example of leadership research done was by P. Alex Linley and Gurpal Minhas researching the strengths that may be found in more effective strengthspotters; the people who are skilled in the identification and development of strengths in others.  The study consisted of an online survey used to collect data on the Strengthspotting Scale, together with an assessment of 60 different strengths using the Realise2 model (www.realise2.com).  There were 528 respondents to retrieve data from and the results showed that the four strengths connector, enabler, esteem builder and feedback were found across the Strengthspotting Scale.  "The strengths of Connector, Enabler and Feedback were significant predictors for each strengthspotting domain, suggesting that these may be the essence of the personal characteristics of an effective strengthspotter" (Linley and Minhas, 2011).

==Academic programs==
There are a considerable number of doctoral, masters, and undergraduate degree programs related to the study of leadership.  Given that the study of leadership is interdisciplinary, leadership-related degree programs are often situated within various colleges, schools, and departments across different university campuses (e.g., Schools of Education at some universities, Business Schools at other universities, and Graduate and Professional Schools at still other universities). As such, at the doctoral level leadership related degree programs primarily include: [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]], and executive doctoral degrees (depending on the situation of the program within the university). At the masters level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Master of Science, Master of Arts, and executive master's degrees. At the undergraduate level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees as well as leadership certificate and minor programs.

The '''Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research''' ({{lang-de|Leibniz-Institut für Ostseeforschung Warnemünde}}, abbreviated IOW) is a research institution located in [[Warnemünde]] ([[Rostock]]), [[Germany]].

It is part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz-Association]], cooperates with the [[University of Rostock]] and was founded in 1992. Employing about 160 people the main focus lies on interdisciplinary study of coastal oceans and marginal seas, especially on [[Baltic Sea]] related [[oceanography]]. The institute is a follow-up of the former Institute of Oceanography ("Institut für Meereskunde") which was part of the [[East Germany|GDR]] Academy of Science.

The institute is divided in four departments: physical oceanography, marine chemistry, biological oceanography, and marine geology. Central task of the institute is fundamental research but also teaching at the universities of [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. IOW has direct access to the research vessel "[[RV Maria S. Merian|Maria S. Merian]]" and can access by request a variety of other medium-sized vessels for longer trips and interdisciplinary tasks from the German research fleet. The institute's facilities are financed by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], and the Ministry of Education of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].

The '''Living Art Marine Center''' is a Marine Science Education Center in the city and county of [[Honolulu]] in the state of [[Hawaii]]. Developer of [[Hawaiian Sealife]], [[Richard Xie]], founded the Living Art Marine Center in 2010. The Living Art Marine Center focuses on educational programs and interactive activities about marine life and the importance of sustainability within the oceans around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Art Marine Center| publisher=Aloha Update| last=Lewis| first=Leoni|url=http://www.alohaupdate.com/2011/07/12/living-art-marine-center/|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tours of the aquarium must be booked in advance, and are intended for children. At the end of the tour visitors can make [[gyotaku]] print shirts or shell necklaces. There is also an area where visitors can touch [[Sea cucumber|sea cucumbers]], [[Hermit crab|hermit crabs]], and other small marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://honolulufamily.com/blogs/living-art-marine-center-world-underwater-thrills-kids/|title=The Living Art Marine Center: A World of Underwater Thrills for Kids|last=Coligny|first=Ashley de|date=2012-08-16|work=HONOLULU Family|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Рatchwork religion''' — term in the [[sociology of religion]] for indicating situations, when individual or religious movement forms its own world view from different elements, which were taken from different existing religions or own [[religious experience]]. Collected from these elements religious world view reminds of a patchwork quilt with a unique pattern. Term has common features with social concepts like [[syncretism]], [[bricolage]], [[sheilaism]].

== History ==
Use of term patchwork concerning religion was for the first time suggested by an American sociologist [[Robert Wuthnow]]. Wutthow studies aspects of American religiosity, believing that its patchwork and avoidance of keeping to strictly defined forms are its essential features. Thus he writes:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“Now, at the end of the twentieth century, growing numbers of Americans piece together their faith like a patchwork quilt. Spirituality has become a vastly complex quest in which each person seeks in his or her own way”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the 1950s / Robert Wuthnow. — Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. — Р. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;At the same time patchwork of individual religiosity, as Wuthnow states, doesn’t contradict loyalty of individual to church’s official position, in which it must be. In his other book Wuthnow connects patchwork with a feature of American religiosity called The Shopping Mentality. Bearers of such mentality mostly admit the existence of God or some kind of mystical force, but believe that none of religions is able to explain exhaustively this mystery to people. At the same time within the framework of each religion good examples of penetration into mysterious spheres of divine can be found, which means that a person can take some elements from each religion in order to gather them into a general picture of individual religiosity.  &lt;blockquote&gt;“When God is ultimately a mystery, it is easy to assume that all religions contain insights about God but no religion provides a complete understanding of God, and thus one way to increase one`s understanding of God is by gleaning ideas from many different religious traditions”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity / Robert Wuthnow. — Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007. — Р. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wuthnow writes about spiritual shoppers as about people, who  &lt;blockquote&gt;“Having learned to be open-minded and to patch together ideas from many different sources”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity / Robert Wuthnow. — Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007. — Р. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Patchwork religion in collective consciousness ==
Nevertheless the fact that originally patchwork religion was applied to individual religiosity, it’s also being used in description of public worldview features. Patchwork is inherent in religious traditions, when their representatives include in original teaching or practice not originally inherent elements, for example which were characteristic for other religion, which was dominant among these representatives before. This explains dual faith, superstitions, which can be characterized as interpolations, brought not by an individual believer, but during a historical process. Some scientists think that each religious tradition has its people’s version, which includes such kinds of interpolations (for example, people’s Catholicism, people’s Buddhism etc.).&lt;ref&gt;«Denz H.» Religion, Popular Piety, Patchwork Religion / Hermann Denz // Church and Religion in Contemporary Europe: Results from Empirical and Comparative Research. — Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, 2009. — P. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Collective form of patchwork religion, as well as an individual, is an evidence of a conjunction to religious tradition of elements, which were not inherent before, or of a refusal to admit elements, which are inherent in it.

A '''pericope''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|ə|p|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|περικοπή}}, "a cutting-out") in [[rhetoric]] is a set of verses that forms one coherent unit or thought, suitable for public reading from a text, now usually of [[sacred scripture]]. Its importance is mainly felt in, but not limited to, narrative portions of Sacred Scripture (as well as poetic sections).

[[Manuscript]]s—often [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]]—called pericopes, are normally [[evangeliaries]], that is, abbreviated [[Gospel Book]]s only containing the sections of the [[Gospel]]s required for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es of the [[liturgical year]]. Notable examples, both [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]], are the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] and the [[Salzburg Pericopes]].

[[Lectionary|Lectionaries]] are normally made up of pericopes containing the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings for the [[liturgical year]]. A pericope consisting of passages from different parts of a single book, or from different books of the Bible, and linked together into a single reading is called a ''[[wikt:concatenation|concatenation]]'' or ''composite reading''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}

'''Propaganda''' is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to [[Social influence|influence]] an audience and further an [[Political agenda|agenda]], often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc. | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations and the media can also produce propaganda. 

In the twentieth century, the term propaganda has often been associated with a [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. Propaganda is now moving into a digital age utillizing bots, algorithms, to create computational propaganda and [[Propaganda on social media|spread fake or biased news using social media]]. 

In a 1929 literary debate with [[Edward Bernays]], [[Everett Dean Martin]] argues that, "Propaganda is making puppets of us. We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates."&lt;ref&gt; [[Everett Dean Martin|Martin, Everett Dean]], Are We Victims of Propaganda, Our Invisible Masters: A Debate with [[Edward Bernays]], The Forum, pp. 142–150, March 1929 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postflaviana.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/martin-bernays-debate.pdf |title=Martin Bernays debate |website=''postflaviana.org'' |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Propaganda'' is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of ''propagare'', meaning ''to spread'' or ''to propagate'', thus ''propaganda'' means ''that which is to be propagated''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the [[Catholic]] church ([[Congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]]) created in 1622, called the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' (''Congregation for Propagating the Faith''), or informally simply ''Propaganda''.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=propaganda|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activity was aimed at "propagating" the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

From the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to ''propaganda'' in secular activities.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt; The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th century, when it was used in the political sphere.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of propaganda}}

Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists. The [[Behistun Inscription]] (c. 515 BC) detailing the rise of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nagle|first=D. Brendan|title=The Ancient World: Readings in Social and Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-69187-6|author2=Stanley M Burstein |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another striking example of propaganda during Ancient History is the last Roman civil wars (44-30 BC) during which [[Augustus|Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]] blame each other for obscure and degrading origins, cruelty, cowardice, oratorical and literary incompetence, debaucheries, luxury, drunkenness and other slanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defamation took the form of ''uituperatio'' (Roman rhetorical genre of the invective) which was decisive for shaping the Roman public opinion at this time.

Propaganda during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], helped by the spread of the [[printing press]] throughout Europe, and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the 16th century. During the era of the [[American Revolution]], the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots (and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists).&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Richard G, 1975, "The Reformation in Print: German Pamphlets and Propaganda. Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte – Archive for Reformation History", Pg. 93–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large-scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914. After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchstoßlegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that "Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny."&lt;ref&gt; Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890–1945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84. &lt;/ref&gt; Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]]. [[World War II]] saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war, building on the experience of WWI, by Goebbels and the British [[Political Warfare Executive]], as well as the United States [[Office of War Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. C., 2007, "Film propaganda in Britain and Nazi Germany : World War II cinema.", Oxford:Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doloy prazdniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Antireligion|Anti-religious]] Soviet propaganda poster, the Russian text reads "Ban Religious Holidays!"]]
In the early 20th century, the invention of motion pictures gave propaganda-creators a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy. In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the "Golden Age of Propaganda". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom. US [[war film]]s in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and [[consensus|convince]] viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Taylor, 1990, "Munitions of the mind: A history of propaganda”, Pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film ''Calling mr. Smith''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|title=Calling Mr. Smith – LUX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|title=Calling Mr Smith – Centre Pompidou}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about lies of nazi propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|title=Franciszka and Stefan Themerson: Calling Mr. Smith (1943) – artincinema|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Bloc|West]] and the [[Soviet Union]] both used propaganda extensively during the [[Cold War]]. Both sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations. [[George Orwell]]'s novels ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. During the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Fidel Castro]] stressed the importance of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prudentiapolitica.blogspot.com/2014/05/fidel-propaganda-is-heart-of-our.html|title=Prudentia Politica|author=prudentiapolitica|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Blogspot is not a reliable source.|date=March 2017}} Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the [[Vietnam War]] as means of controlling people's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sophana2007vietnamese.pdf] Vietnamese propaganda reflections from 1945 to 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yugoslav wars]], propaganda was used as a [[military strategy]] by governments of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia. Propaganda was used to create fear and hatred, and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities ([[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Albanians]] and other non-Serbs). Serb media made a great effort in justifying, revising or denying mass [[war crimes]] committed by Serb forces during these wars.&lt;ref name="Boston University"&gt;{{cite web|date=12 April 1999|title=Serbian Propaganda: A Closer Look|url=http://www.bu.edu/globalbeat/pubs/Pesic041299.html|quote=NOAH ADAMS: The European Center for War, Peace and the News Media, based in London, has received word from Belgrade that no pictures of mass Albanian refugees have been shown at all, and that the Kosovo humanitarian catastrophe is only referred to as the one made up or over-emphasised by Western propaganda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perceptions== 
In the early 20th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent [[public relations]] industry to refer to their people. Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as "things that must be disseminated", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term "propaganda" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word "propaganda" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&amp;nbsp;– "advertising".

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]
In English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly "compelling" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, "In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. … The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' "&lt;ref&gt;pp. 260–261, "The Function of the Propagandist", ''International Journal of Ethics'', 38 (no. 3): pp. 258–268.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, "After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don’t like of the other fellow’s publicity,' as Edward L. Bernays said...."&lt;ref&gt;p. 113, ''Party and Pressure Politics'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9 &amp;  Taylor, Phil M. (2002), ‘Debate: Strategic Communications or Democratic Propaganda?’, in Journalism Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 437–452.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that ethics depend on intent and context,&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt; others define it as necessarily unethical and negative.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, L.W. (1949), Public Opinion and Propaganda, London: Cresset Press p 240&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Emma Briant defines it as "the deliberate manipulation of representations (including text, pictures, video, speech etc.) with the intention of producing any effect in the audience (e.g. action or inaction; reinforcement or transformation of feelings, ideas, attitudes or behaviours) that is desired by the propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Identifying propaganda has always been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J Schwindt, [https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Modern-World-Traditionalist/dp/153282534X The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought], 2016, pp. 202–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of [[persuasion]], and avoiding a [[bias]]ed approach. Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: "Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; The definition focuses on the communicative process involved – or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow "propaganda" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. 
[[File:Propaganda poster in a primary school - DPRK (2604154887).jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korean primary school]]

According to historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|ISBN=0-85613-312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.

The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.

===Religious===
Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues, particularly during the split between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]].

More in line with the religious roots of the term, propaganda is also used widely in the debates about [[new religious movement]]s (NRMs), both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them. The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of "cults" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing "Cult" and "Sect" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) – CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime===
[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]

Post–World War II usage of the word "propaganda" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.

Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms "Jap" and "gook" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as "Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly."&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 –  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the "actor" or "system" that performs it.

Propaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).&lt;ref&gt;Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947–1963. Durham University. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select "agreeable" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.

[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I.]]

Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a "well-known fact", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.

In the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Karel C. Berkhoff, ''Motherland in Danger: Soviet Propaganda during World War II'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Motherland-Danger-Soviet-Propaganda-during/dp/0674049241/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent. That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his "majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhores A. Medvedev and |title=The Unknown Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3BrNF80AzUC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2003|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes [[incitement]] to discrimination, hostility or violence by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|website=United Nations Human Rights: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Gilbert in Göring's jail cell during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials (18 April 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Advertising===
Propaganda shares techniques with advertising and [[public relations]], each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization, person, or brand.

[[File:'Destroy this mad brute' WWI propaganda poster (US version).jpg|thumb|upright|[[World War I]] propaganda poster for enlistment in the [[American Expeditionary Forces|U.S. Army]]]]
Journalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective, giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand. On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily "believed" or "internalized". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of "covert" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.

===Politics===
Propaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as "covert propaganda".

Roderick Hindery argues&lt;ref&gt;Hindery, Roderick R., Indoctrination and Self-deception or Free and Critical Thought? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; that propaganda exists on the political left, and right, and in mainstream centrist parties. Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking "what is or is not propaganda?" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/counterterrorism. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.

Since [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain. [[Dr Emma Louise Briant]] shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross-government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences, with new efforts in [[strategic communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briant|title=Allies and Audiences Evolving Strategies in Defense and Intelligence Propaganda|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=April 2015|volume=20|issue=2|pages=145–165|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/20/2/145.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subject to contestation within the [[US Government]], resisted by [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs]] and critiqued by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Emma|title=Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: strategies for global change|date=2015|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (popularly referred to as the [[Smith-Mundt Act]]) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within U.S. borders for the Archivist of the United States. The Smith-Mundt Act, as amended, provided that "the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States, for domestic distribution, motion pictures, films, videotapes, and other material 12 years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad (...) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure." Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith-Mundt Act|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130715/11210223804/anti-propaganda-ban-repealed-freeing-state-dept-to-direct-its-broadcasting-arm-american-citizens.shtml|website='Anti-Propaganda' Ban Repealed, Freeing State Dept.

==Techniques==
{{details|Propaganda techniques}}

[[File:Anti-capitalism color.gif|right|upright|thumb|[[Anti-Capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] propaganda]]

Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, [[junk science]], books, leaflets, [[propaganda film|movies]], radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda &amp; Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.

Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. &lt;!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to "destroy the old world, forge the new world," referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] --&gt;

==Models==

===Social psychology===

The field of [[social psychology]] includes the study of [[persuasion]]. Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize–winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.

According to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article "A psychological definition of propaganda", "[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of "we" versus an "enemy"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, William W. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1932-03618-001 A psychological definition of propaganda]. [[The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]], Vol 26(3), Oct 1931, 283–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herman and Chomsky===
[[File:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Early 20th-century depiction of a "European [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]" attempting to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]]]]

The [[propaganda model]] is a theory advanced by [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] which argues [[systemic bias]]es in the mass media and seeks to explain them in terms of structural economic [[cause]]s:

{{quote|The 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of [[corporate power]], and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Noam Chomsky" to ''Covert Action Quarterly,'' quoting [[Alex Carey (writer)|Alex Carey]], Australian social scientist, {{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710125156/http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/25/006.html|title=Review of Alex Carey, Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Propaganda in the US and Australia|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

First presented in their 1988 book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', the [[propaganda model]] views the private media as businesses selling a product&amp;nbsp;– readers and [[audiences]] (rather than news)&amp;nbsp;– to other businesses (advertisers) and relying primarily on government and corporate information and propaganda. The theory postulates five general classes of "filters" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.

The first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the [[model (abstract)|model]] postulates as the cause of [[media bias]].

==Children==

The text reads: "Sandinista children: Toño, Delia and Rodolfo are in the Association of Sandinista Children. Sandinista children use a [[neckerchief]]. They participate in the revolution and are very studious."]]
Of all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, as well as in [[Stalinist]] Russia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 
[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to "dumb us down" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman &amp; Chomsky thesis of rise of Corporate Power, and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.

===Anti-Semitic propaganda for children===
In [[Nazi]] Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with [[anti-Semitic]] ideology. This was accomplished through the [[National Socialist Teachers League]], of which 97% of all German teachers were members in 1937. The League encouraged the teaching of racial theory. Picture books for children such as ''Don't Trust A Fox in A Green Meadow or The Word of A Jew'', ''[[Der Giftpilz]]'' (translated into English as ''The Poisonous Mushroom'') and ''The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pincher'' were widely circulated (over 100,000 copies of ''Don't Trust A Fox''...&amp;nbsp;were circulated during the late 1930s) and contained depictions of Jews as devils, child molesters and other morally charged figures. Slogans such as "Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews" were recited in class.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Mary. "Propaganda and Children During the Hitler Years". Jewish Virtual Library. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/propchil.html&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of a propagandistic math problem recommended by the National Socialist Essence of Education: "The Jews are aliens in Germany—in 1933 there were 66,606,000 inhabitants in the German Reich, of whom 499,682 (.75%) were Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Herbert. ''Genocide and the Politics of Memory''. Chapel Hill &amp; London: University of North Carolina Press, 1995. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Repetition priming can occur without a person being aware of either the repeats or the improvements in his/her response, so it is generally thought to involve [[implicit memory]] processes that are dissociable from [[explicit memory]] processes.&lt;ref name="Rugg 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rugg|first1=M.D|last2=Mark|first2=R.E|last3=Walla|first3=P|last4=Schloerscheidt|first4=A.M|last5=Birch|first5=C.S|last6=Allan|first6=K|title=Dissociation of the neural correlates of implicit and explicit memory|journal=Nature|date=1998|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=595–598|doi=10.1038/33396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has support from findings that [[amnesic]] patients with damage to [[limbic]] and/or [[diencephalic]] structures show measurable repetition priming effects but have deficits on explicit measures of memory.&lt;ref name="Kinder &amp; Shanks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinder|first1=A|last2=Shanks|first2=D.R|title=Amnesia and the declarative/nondeclarative distinction: A recurrent network model of classification, recognition, and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2001|volume=13|issue=5|pages=648–669|doi=10.1162/089892901750363217|pmid=11506662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleischman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleischman|first1=D.A|title=Repetition priming in aging and Alzheimer's disease: an integrative review and future directions|journal=Cortex|date=2007|volume=43|issue=7|pages=889–897|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some researchers suggest that implicit and explicit memory systems are not in fact separate.&lt;ref name=Reder&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reder|first1=L.M|last2=Park|first2=H|last3=Kieffaber|first3=P.D|title=Memory systems do not divide on consciousness: Reinterpreting memory in terms of activation and binding|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=1|pages=23–49|doi=10.1037/a0013974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition priming has also been associated with attentional processes,&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=J|last2=Smith|first2=A.T|title=fMRI repetition suppression: neuronal adaptation or stimulus expectation?|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2012|volume=22|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr119|pmc=3278317}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulus expectation&lt;ref name=Summerfield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Summerfield|first1=C|last2=Egner|first2=T|last3=Greene|first3=M|last4=Koechlin|first4=E|last5=Mangels|first5=J|last6=Hirsch|first6=J|title=Predictive codes for forthcoming perception in the frontal cortex|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=314|issue=5803|pages=1311–1314|doi=10.1126/science.1132028|pmid=17124325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=W.T|title=Episodic retrieval in negative priming and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1291–3105|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.6.1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into repetition priming has been used to investigate the nature of mechanisms underlying the behavioural effects of rapid learning.  In utilizing measures of ''repetition suppression'', the putative neural correlate of repetition priming, and measuring changes in the neural response associated with changing the presented stimuli, researchers are attempting to index regions and their processing biases along perceptual, conceptual and response dimensions.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Malach|first2=R|title=fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons|journal=Acta Psychologia|date=2001|volume=107|issue=1|pages=293–321|doi=10.1016/s0001-6918(01)00019-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This area of research is based on multiple measurement methods from single cell recordings&lt;ref name=Sobotka&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobotka|first1=S|last2=Ringo|first2=J.L|title=Stimulus specific adaptation in excited but not in inhibited cells in inferotemporal cortex of macaque|journal=Brain Research|date=1994|volume=646|pages=95–99|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)90061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to multi-regional measurements using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI),&lt;ref name="Buckner &amp; Koustaal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckner|first1=R.L|last2=Koustaal|first2=W|title=Functional neuroimaging studies of encoding, priming, and explicit memory retrieval|journal=Proc.

== Theories and models ==
Numerous models have been put forward to explain behavioural efficiencies that are gained with repeated presentations of the same or similar stimuli.  These are outlined below.

===''Fatigue''===
In this model the attenuation of a neural response is hypothesised to be due to an overall reduction in the [[amplitude]] of a neuron's firing.&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=A|last2=Movshon|first2=J.A|title=Neuronal adaptation to visual motion in area MT of the macaque|journal=Neuron|date=2003|volume=39|issue=4|pages=681–691|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether this reduction occurs across all neurons that responded to the initial stimulus or just the critical subset of those that initially responded maximally, is still unclear.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Henson|first2=R|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evidence does suggest that a mechanism like this reduces redundant neural firing and enhances efficiencies in processing in the early visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dragoi|first1=V|last2=Sharma|first2=J|last3=Miller|first3=E.K|last4=Sur|first4=M|title=Dynamics of neuronal sensitivity in visual cortex and local feature discrimination|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=2002|volume=5|issue=9|pages=883–891|doi=10.1038/nn900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sharpening''===
Along similar lines is the idea that repetition causes the neurons that are less relevant to the representation of the stimulus to stop firing when that stimulus is repeated.&lt;ref name=Wiggs&amp;Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiggs|first1=C.L|last2=Martin|first2=A|title=Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=1998|volume=8|pages=227–233|doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(98)80144-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way the representation is supported by a gradually sparser response, resulting in an adaptive reduction in metabolic requirements and increased efficiencies in information transmission through the neural hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  This could be the result of lateral inhibition within representational levels in a competitive [[Hebbian]] learning system, where strong connections get stronger and inhibit the weaker connections.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  Much of the evidence for this comes from primate studies of the [[inferotemporal cortex]]&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=D.J|last2=Riesenhuber|first2=M|last3=Poggio|first3=T|last4=Miller|first4=E.K|title=Experience-dependent sharpening of visual shape selectivity in inferior temporal cortex|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2006|volume=16|issue=11|pages=1631–1644|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhj100|pmid=16400159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and single cell recordings with long training periods.&lt;ref name=Sigala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigala|first1=N|last2=Logothetis|first2=N.K|title=Visual categorization shapes feature selectivity in the primate temporal cortex|journal=Nature|date=2002|volume=415|issue=6869|pages=318–320|doi=10.1038/415318a|pmid=11797008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, decreases in firing rate over short-term training on repeated stimuli appear to be greatest in those cells that initially respond with the highest activation rate,&lt;ref name="Li miller desimone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=L|last2=Miller|first2=E.K|last3=Desimone|first3=R|title=The representation of stimulus familiarity in anterior inferior temporal cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1993|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1918–1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the fatigue model above.

===''Facilitation''===
The key concept in this model is that information travels faster through the network when the current stimulus representation overlaps with a previous representation, driven by more rapid onset of neural activation with repeated presentations.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=T.W|last2=Gauthier|first2=I|title=Repetition‐induced changes in BOLD response reflect accumulation of neural activity|journal=Human Brain Mapping|date=2006|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–46|doi=10.1002/hbm.20165|pmid=15954142}}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI studies have been used in an attempt to measure these potential latency differences but the temporal resolution is not very precise&lt;ref name="Gagnepain 2008" /&gt; and single cell recordings typically do not show shortened latencies to repeated stimuli.&lt;ref name=Pedreira&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedreira|first1=C|last2=Mormann|first2=F|last3=Kraskov|first3=A|last4=Cerf|first4=M|last5=Fried|first5=I|last6=Koch|first6=C|last7=Quiroga|first7=R.Q|title=Responses of human medial temporal lobe neurons are modulated by stimulus repetition|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2010|volume=103|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1152/jn.91323.2008|pmid=19864436|pmc=2807242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possible explanation of facilitation is synaptic potentiation within an [[attractor network|attractor neural network]] model where repetition decreases the settling time as the attractor basin deepens and so increases the overall speed of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=S|last2=Moscovitch|first2=M|last3=Behrmann|first3=M|last4=Joordens|first4=S|title=Long-term semantic priming: a computational account and empirical evidence|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1059–1082|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.5.1059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Reduced prediction error/stimulus expectation''===
When a stimulus is repeated top-down feedback modulates the neural response of earlier processing regions,&lt;ref name="Friston 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friston|first1=K|title=A theory of cortical responses|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2005|volume=360|issue=1456|pages=815–836|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1622|pmid=15937014|pmc=1569488}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reduced neural activation and improved behavioural responses reflecting fulfilled expectations.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  The idea for this comes from [[predictive coding]] theories and Bayesian statistics&lt;ref name="Rao &amp; Ballard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rao|first1=R.P|last2=Ballard|first2=D.H|title=Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=1999|volume=2|issue=1|pages=79–87|doi=10.1038/4580|pmid=10195184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has some support in fMRI studies manipulating stimulus expectation.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  However, the results may also reflect the involvement of attention, which seems to have a modulatory effect on the extent of priming elicited.&lt;ref name=Larsson /&gt;

===''Neural synchrony''===
This theory is based on the idea that because downstream neurons are sensitive to both the firing rates and the timing of those inputs, efficiencies in processing may be gained through synchronised activation.&lt;ref name="Gilbert Gotts Carver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=J.R|last2=Gotts|first2=S.J|last3=Carver|first3=F.W|last4=Martin|first4=A|title=Object repetition leads to local increases in the temporal coordination of neural responses|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of synchronisation associated with repeated stimuli include phase locking found between two regions of the cat visual cortex while measuring spike synchronisation for trained compared with novel stimuli&lt;ref name="von Stein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Stein|first1=A|last2=Chiang|first2=C|last3=Konig|first3=P|title=Top-down processing mediated by interareal synchronization|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2000|volume=97|pages=14748–14753|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.26.14748|pmid=11121074|pmc=18990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suppressed firing and increased synchrony of spikes with repetition of odour puffs to locust's antennae.&lt;ref name=Stopfer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stopfer|first1=M|last2=Laurent|first2=G|title=Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics|journal=Nature|date=1000|volume=402|pages=664–668|doi=10.1038/45244|pmid=10604472}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] suggests that stimulus repetition in humans results in increased synchrony between distinct cortical regions, often the same regions that show reduced local neural activity (see repetition suppression below).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghuman|first=Avniel S.|last2=Bar|first2=Moshe|last3=Dobbins|first3=Ian G.|last4=Schnyer|first4=David M.|date=2008-06-17|title=The effects of priming on frontal-temporal communication|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=105|issue=24|pages=8405–8409|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710674105|issn=1091-6490|pmc=2448849|pmid=18541919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gotts Chow &amp; Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gotts|first1=S.J|last2=Chow|first2=C.C|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition priming and repetition suppression: A case for enhanced efficiency through neural synchronization|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=227–237|doi=10.1080/17588928.2012.670617|pmc=3491809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the timing of this across-region synchronization predicted the amount of behavioral facilitation seen with repetition priming, suggestive of a close link between synchrony and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===''Stimulus-response binding''===
This theory suggests that repetition priming is a result of binding the initial stimulus directly to the response while bypassing the intervening layers of computation.&lt;ref name="Dobbins 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobbins|first1=I.G|title=Cortical activity reductions during repetition priming can result from rapid response learning|journal=Nature|date=2004|volume=428|pages=316–319|doi=10.1038/nature02400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanism mediating this direct binding has not been clarified but several hypotheses have been put forward.  One theory explains it as a race between automatic activation of a previous stimulus-response route and the reengagement of the "algorithmic" route&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=G.D|title=Repetition priming and automaticity: Common underlying mechanisms?|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(90)90002-l}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another theory suggests the operation of an "action-trigger" where repeated stimuli trigger the previous response through perceptual or conceptual associations with the original stimulus.&lt;ref name=Kunde&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunde|first1=W|title=Conscious control over the content of unconscious cognition|journal=Cognition|date=2003|volume=88|pages=223–242|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of this theory is evidence of a response congruency effect, which would be expected from these stimulus-response bindings.&lt;ref name="Henson 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Eckstein|first2=D|last3=Waszak|first3=F|last4=Frings|first4=C|last5=Horner|first5=A.J|title=Stimulus–response bindings in priming|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2014|volume=18|issue=7|pages=376–384|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased synchrony between regions discussed above could be a neural correlate of stimulus-response binding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Neural correlates ==

=== Repetition suppression ===
The phenomenon of ''repetition suppression'', a reduction in neural activity when stimuli are repeated, is thought to depend on processing overlaps between repeated items&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=R.A|last2=Parker|first2=W.E|last3=Feiler|first3=A.M|title=Two kinds of fMRI repetition suppression? Evidence for dissociable neural mechanisms|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2008|volume=99|pages=2877–2886|doi=10.1152/jn.90376.2008|pmid=18400954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to be the neural correlate of repetition priming.  As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001" /&gt;  In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the processing level at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features.&lt;ref name=Kristjansson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristjánsson|first1=Á|last2=Campana|first2=G|title=Where perception meets memory: A review of repetition priming in visual search tasks|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date=2010|volume=72|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.3758/app.72.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, care must be taken in interpreting the results of these studies as the relationship between repetition suppression and repetition priming has not been definitively established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=D.B|last2=Olson|first2=C.R|title=Repetition suppression in monkey inferotemporal cortex: relation to behavioral priming|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2007|volume=97|issue=5|pages=3532–3543|doi=10.1152/jn.01042.2006|pmid=17344370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repetition enhancement ===
Although repetition priming is most often associated with neural attenuation for repeated presentation of stimuli, increases in neural responses have also been measured in a number of experimental contexts.  For example, when performing mathematical calculations,&lt;ref name=Salimpoor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salimpoor|first1=V.N|last2=Chang|first2=C|last3=Menon|first3=V|title=Neural basis of repetition priming during mathematical cognition: repetition suppression or repetition enhancement?|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=790–805|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21234|pmc=4366146}}&lt;/ref&gt; when repeated stimuli are degraded,&lt;ref name="Horner &amp; Henson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=A.J|last2=Henson|first2=R.N|title=Priming, response learning and repetition suppression|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2008|volume=46|issue=7|pages=1979–1991|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in studies involving a backward masking paradigm&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006" /&gt; and when stimuli have no pre-existing associations or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Shallice|first2=T|last3=Dolan|first3=R|title=Neuroimaging evidence for dissociable forms of repetition priming|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=287|issue=5456|pages=1269–1272|doi=10.1126/science.287.5456.1269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Guide to Research in Music Education,'' Phelps, Ferrara and Goolsby define research as the identification and isolation of a problem into a workable plan; the implementation of that plan to collect the data needed; and the synthesis, interpretation and presentation of the collected information into some format which readily can be made available to others. Research typically falls into one of four categories: experimental, descriptive, historical, or philosophical.

==Types of Research==

===Experimental===
Experimental research is used to determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental research is a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the study was to determine if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire.

===Descriptive===
Descriptive research is used to determine what is and is usually conducted for one of three purposes:
#to obtain data on the current status of existing phenomena, such as conditions, practices, and situations
#to establish relationships among several variables, using the data about the current status to investigate relationships that may provide greater insight into the current status
#to determine developments, trends, or changes by describing variables as they develop over a period of time
There are three broad categories of descriptive research: survey studies, relationship studies, and development studies.

====Survey Studies====
A survey is a systematic method of collecting information on one or more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The purpose of the study was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. The findings indicated a continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs.

====Development Studies====
Development studies collect information on existing situations, determine relationships, and examine changes in these variables over a period of time. Development studies include:
#longitudinal studies, which are conducted over a period of time with data collected from the same sample at specific intervals during the study
#trend studies, in which a population is sampled and subjects at the same level of development are tested
#cohort studies, which measure an entire population at periodic intervals over a period of time

===Historical===
Historical research refers to the collection of data to record and interpret past events. Source materials used by the historical researcher are normally of two kinds, primary and secondary. A primary source is first-hand information, observed directly by the researcher. A secondary source is second-hand information, not original to the researcher. Through the process of external criticism, the researcher learns whether or not the object of scrutiny is authentic. Through the process of internal criticism, the researcher determines if the information contained in the object is credible. An example of historical research is a 1993 study by Gruhn. The purpose of the study was to determine if [[Lowell Mason]]'s ''Manual of the Boston Academy of Music for the Instruction in the Elements of Vocal Music on the System of Pestalozzi'' is truly based on Pestalozzian principles. A detailed comparison of the ''Manual,'' a work by Pfeiffer and Nageli, and a work by Kubler revealed that the Pfeiffer and Nageli work is much closer to the ideas advocated by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] than the Kubler work, and that Mason's ''Manual'' is little more than a translation of Kubler.

===Philosophical===
[[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Philosophical research]] is used to examine the underlying principles in any field. An example of philosophical research is a 1999 article by [[Bennett Reimer]] published in ''The Music Educators Journal'': "Facing the Risks of the Mozart Effect." This article is a response to the practice of music educators who advocated music education because of its relationship to spatial task performance. A 1993 research report from the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irving by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky is an example of the research literature that supported what became to be known as "the [[Mozart Effect]]." Reimer rejects spatial task performance as justification for music education because, according to Reimer's aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified by its merit as an art, not for extra-musical reasons.

==History of Research in American Music Education==
In 1837 the Connecticut General Assembly voted to collect educational data. Questionnaires were sent to all Connecticut schools in 1838. Eight questions were about music instruction. This was probably the first attempt in the U.S. to collect data on music instruction on a wide-scale basis and perhaps the earliest example of research in music education.

In 1918 the Educational Council was established by the Music Supervisors National Conference (later the Music Educators National Conference or [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|MENC]]). The Educational Council published bulletins, mostly based on survey data and including recommendations for the profession. One such bulletin was ''The Present Status of Music Instruction in Colleges and High Schools 1919-1920.'' In 1923 the name of the organization was changed form Educational Council to the National Research Council of Music Education. The name changed again in 1932 to the Music Education Research Council. The ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' began publication in 1953 under the editorship of [[Allen Britton]]. At first many of the articles were based on historical and descriptive research, but in the early 1960s the journal began to shift to experimental research. The Society for Research in Music Education was established in 1960, and in 1963 the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' became its official publication. The MENC Historical Center was established in 1965. In 1978, MENC founded several Special Research Interest Groups.

==Research Publications==
Price and Chang (2000) provide an overview of the many diverse music education research journals including annotation and publication details for each source. While the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' continues to be the dominant journal in the field, other journals include the ''[[Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education]],'' ''The Missouri Journal of Research in Music Education,'' ''The Bulletin of Research, Contributions to Music Education, The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education,'' and ''Update: The Applications of Research in Music Education. '' Research on the impact of music education research journals includes investigations of initial citation speeds (Hancock, 2015) and accumulated citations (Hamann &amp; Lucas, 1998).

==Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning==
One of the dominant events in the field of music education research was the 1992 publication of the ''Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.'' Edited by Richard Colwell, the ''Handbook'' contains fifty-five chapters written by more than seventy scholars. Colwell edited a second volume in 2002, ''The New Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.''

To see the shift of emphasis that has taken place in music education research in recent years, one need only compare the contents of the 1992 volume and the 2002 volume. The inclusion of sections on "Conceptual Framework" and "Evaluation" in the 1992 volume is evidence of emphasis on standards and a set body of knowledge. The absence of similar sections in the 2002 volume is evidence of a shift toward a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophical and a [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] teaching theory. The inclusion of a section on "related arts" in the 2002 volume recalls the research of the late 1960s and 1970s.

A [[simulation game]] is "a [[game]] that contains a mixture of [[game of skill|skill]], [[game of chance|chance]], and [[game of strategy|strategy]] to simulate an aspect of reality, such as a [[stock exchange]]". Similarly, Finnish author [[Virpi Ruohomäki]] states that "a simulation game combines the features of a game (competition, cooperation, rules, participants, roles) with those of a simulation (incorporation of critical features of reality). A game is a simulation game if its rules refer to an empirical model of reality."&lt;ref name="Riis"&gt;{{cite book | author= Ruohomaki, V. | title= Viewpoints on Learning and Education with Simulation Games in Simulation Games and Learning in Production Management edited by Jens O. Riis | publisher= Springer | year=1995| id=ISBN O-412-72100-7 | pages = 14–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A properly built simulation game used to teach or learn [[economics]] would closely follow the assumptions and rules of the [[Model (economics)|theoretical model]]s within this discipline.

==In economics education==

[[Economics education]] studies recommend the adoption of more active and collaborative learning methodologies (Greenlaw, 1999).&lt;ref name="Greenlaw"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Greenlaw, S.A.| year = 1999| title = Using groupware to enhance teaching and learning in undergraduate economics | journal = Journal of Economic Education | volume = 30 (Winter) | pages =33–42 | doi = 10.2307/1183031 | issue = 1 | jstor = 1183031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simkins (1999) stated "… ''teaching practices, which rely heavily on the lecture format, are not doing enough to develop students' cognitive learning skills, attract good students to economics, and motivate them to continue coursework in the discipline.''" (p. 278).&lt;ref name="Simkins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simkins, S.P.| year = 1999| title = Promoting active-student learning using the World Wide Web in economics courses| journal = Journal of Economic Education | volume = 30 (Summer) | pages =278–91 | doi = 10.2307/1183067 | issue = 3 | jstor = 1183067}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the results of a survey published in the American Economic Review by Allgood (2004) that shows that students "rarely take economics as a free elective – especially beyond  principles." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref name="Allgood"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allgood, S.Bosshardt, W., Van der Klaauw, W., and Watts, M. | year = 2004| title = What Students Remember and Say about College Economics Years Later| journal = American Economic Review | volume = 94 | pages =259–65 | doi = 10.1257/0002828041301731 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More is needed to be done in the classroom to excite students about economics education.

Simulations supplement the standard lecture.  Both computerized and non-computer based simulation and games show significant levels of growth in education (see Lean, Moizer, Towler, and Abbey, 2006;&lt;ref name="Lean"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lean, J., Moizer, M., Towler, C. A.| year = 2006| journal = Active Learning in Higher Education| title = Simulation and games | volume = 7 | pages =227–42 | issue=3 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00571951/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbins, Boehlje, Erickson and Taylor, 1995;&lt;ref name="Dobbins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dobbins, C.

==Example in monopolistic competition==

Through a simulation game, students may participate directly in a market by managing a simulated firm and making decisions on price and production to maximize profits.  An excellent review of the use of a successful market simulation is given by Motahar (1994) in the Journal of Economics Education.&lt;ref name="Motahar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Motahar, E. | year = 1994| title = Teaching Modeling and Simulation in Economics: A Pleasant Surprise | journal = Journal of Economics Education| volume = 25 | pages =335–342 | doi = 10.2307/1182981 | issue = 4 | jstor = 1182981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monopolistic competition simulation game can be used as an example in the standard economics classroom or for [[experimental economics]]. Economic experiments using monopolistic competition simulations can create real-world incentives that may be used in the teaching and learning of economics to help students better understand why markets and other exchange systems work the way they do.  An explanation of experimental economics is given by Roth (1995).
&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite book | author= Roth, A.E. | title= Introduction to experimental economics in The Handbook of Experimental Economics by Kagel, J.H. and Roth, A.E.| publisher= Princeton University Press | year=1995|  pages = 3–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assumptions of monopolistic competition'''

A simulation game in [[monopolistic competition]] needs to incorporate the standard theoretical assumptions of this market structure, including: 
* Many buyers and sellers
* Easy entry and exit
* Some degree of product differentiation
* Zero economic profits in the long-run

In a simulation of monopolistic competition, each firm must be small in size, and should not be able to influence the direction of the overall market.  Yet each firm has some control over price owing to product differentiation.  To be consistent with economic theory, the simulation model should allow entry of new firms to occur as long as profits are greater than normal, and economic profits exist. The entry of new firms will decrease the market price, and eventually cause economic profits to return to zero (see Baye, 2009).&lt;ref name="Baye"&gt;{{cite book | author=Baye, Michael | title= Managerial Economics and Business Strategy | publisher= McGraw-Hill/Irwin | year=2009| pages = 294–304 | isbn=978-0-07-337568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controllable decisions in monopolistic competition'''

To simulate monopolistic competition, the controllable firm decisions of the participants (students) must include, at a minimum, those specified in the standard theoretical model, including (see Baye, 2009):&lt;ref name="Baye"/&gt; 
* Firm price
* Advertising
* Firm production
* Plant Size

'''Simulation game experience'''

From an educational point of view, students will have an "opportunity" to learn by their own observations and experience through participation in a simulation game (see Schmidt, 2003).&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00220480309595209 | author = Schmidt, Stephen J. | year = 2003| title = Active and cooperative learning using Web-based simulations | journal = Journal of Economics Education| volume = 34 | pages =151–167 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the theoretical model of monopolistic competition (see Baye, 2009),&lt;ref name="Baye"/&gt; student participants would observe and experience that their pricing decisions are controlled by the market. They would "experience" that in the simulation they would have to lower their firm's price to be competitive as new firms entered the market.  In the long-run, they would see the impact of changing plant size.  They would observe that the successful firms would take advantage of economies of scale, but would also be careful not to incur [[diseconomies of scale]] in the long-run.  Students would experience that economic profits cannot be maintained in the long-run. They would see, first hand, that their accounting profits will inevitably decline and move closer to normal profits.  This experience provides students an opportunity to learn (as a supplement to the lecture and readings) the economic messages of monopolistic competition.

== Example in Macroeconomics ==
In 2018, Harvard Business Publishing published "Macroeconomics Simulation: Econland". This 30-minute simulation brings economic policymaking to life by allowing students to make monetary and fiscal policy decisions and consider their impact on the economy of a fictional country. Students manage the economy through a 7-year business cycle in an effort to maximize the approval rating from their population. Exploring the trade-offs of economic policy decision-making and the effects of the global economic environment on a country, students consolidate their understanding of core macroeconomic concepts, including GDP, unemployment, inflation, and budget deficit. At a deeper level, students develop critical thinking skills and learn about economic modeling and system dynamics. The simulation won a Silver Medal at the International Serious Play Awards.

[[File:Beethoven sketch op 101a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A sketch page of Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano sonata, Opus 101]]. At upper left can be seen the theme that opens the final movement.]]
In music, a '''sketch''' is an informal document prepared by a composer to assist in the process of [[Musical composition|composition]].

Sketches may range greatly in scope and detail, from the smallest snippets to full drafts; concerning [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s sketchbooks, for instance, Dean writes that they "include every imaginable state between unaccompanied melodic motifs of a few notes to thoroughly worked-out full scores; even his fair copies of essentially ‘finished’ works show the signs of continuing composition."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Dean (n.d.) "Sketch", in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', online edition, oxfordmusiconline.com, downloaded 10 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a composer's sketches survive past his or her lifetime depends particular on the composer's own practice and partly on posterity's.  Some composers habitually discarded their sketches when a composition was completed (for instance, [[Johannes Brahms]]),&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;Marston (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; while others kept their sketches; sometimes in great numbers, as in the case of Beethoven.  Mozart kept a great many sketches, but some were given away to friends as keepsakes following his death, and lost.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Why do composers sketch?==
One reason for sketches is the fallibility of human memory. But there are more sophisticated reasons to sketch: most of classical music arranges the themes of each movement into a substantial architecture, for instance involving [[sonata form]]. The eighteenth century theorists H. C. Koch and J. G. Sulzer, in their written advice to composers, suggested that they should prepare sketches that would lay out how the various [[Theme (music)|themes]] of the work would be arranged to create the overall structure.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt; Marston adds that Koch and Sulzer's recommendations "do in fact accord well with what scholars, borrowing from the terminology developed in relation to Beethoven's sketches, call a ‘continuity draft’, a notational form in which [for example] ‘Beethoven can be seen fitting together the more fragmentary ideas made earlier into a coherent whole’ (Cooper, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;105)."&lt;ref&gt;Marston (n.d.). Marston cited [[Barry Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]]'s book ''Beethoven and the Creative Process'' (Oxford, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons to study sketches==
Since the mid-19th century, the study of composers' sketches has been a branch of [[musicology]].  Nicholas Marston, writing in the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove]], lists three reasons why the study of sketches can be of interest.

*The history of how a work was created serves as data for biographical accounts of composers; for instance, it can tell us whether a composition was the product of years of work or quickly achieved.
*Sketches are occasionally used by composers in attempts to write convincing completions of works left unfinished by other composers at their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see [[Requiem (Mozart)]], [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)]], [[Symphony No. 10 (Schubert)]], [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)]], and [[Symphony No. 3 (Elgar/Payne)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Above all, there is the interest, widely-shared among devotees of music, in how compositions were created; as the ''Oxford Dictionary of Music'' says, sketches are "of great fascination to musical scholars as showing the workings of a composer's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Online edition, article "Sketch", at oxfordmusiconline.com, downloaded 10 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This holds both for the general question of how composition takes place, but also at the level of individual works:  scholars are interested (Marston) in "the ‘biography’ of the composition, as it were, rather than of the composer."  He adds a caveat:  "it should be obvious that ‘compositional process’ denotes a spectrum of activities far too complex to be equated simply with the writing of sketches."

A fourth possibility is also mentioned by Marston, namely that one might appeal to the sketches to support a particular formal analysis (i.e. in music theory) of a finished work. This practice is controversial.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;

===J.S. Bach===
[[File:Bach-wtc1-prelude1-early-ms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Bach's sketch, in the ''Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach'', of what would become the first prelude of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'']]
Surviving sketches by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] include:{{sfn|Schmieder, Dürr, and Kobayashi|1998}}{{sfn|BD website}}
* ''O Traurigkeit, o herzeleid'', {{nowrap|[[BWV Anh. 200]]}}: sketch (fragment) of a chorale prelude in the ''[[Orgelbüchlein]]'' manuscript
* [[BWV Anh. 2]]: outline of a [[Church cantata (Bach)#Trinity XIX|cantata for Trinity XIX]] (6 bars)&lt;ref&gt;Work {{BDW|1309}} at [[Bach Digital]] website&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BWV 149/1a]]: instrumental opening movement of a cantata, breaking off after the first word with which the singers enter ("{{lang|de|Man}}..."), and thus seen as an alternative abandoned draft of the only [[Bach cantata]] that opens with that word ([[Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg, BWV 149|''Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg'', BWV&amp;nbsp;149]])
* [[BWV 1059]], fragment of nine bars of a harpsichord concerto (arranged from the opening sinfonia, for organ and orchestra, of the cantata [[Geist und Seele wird verwirret, BWV 35|''Geist und Seele wird verwirret'', BWV&amp;nbsp;35]])
The ''[[Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'' contains, among several comparable early versions of compositions that became better known in their later versions, a sketch of what evolved into the [[Prelude and Fugue in C major, BWV 846|first prelude]] of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.{{sfn|Schmieder, Dürr, and Kobayashi|1998}}{{sfn|BD website}}

===Mozart===
{{see also|Mozart's compositional method}}
The body of sketches by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is very substantial. The [[watermark]] studies of [[Alan Tyson]] yielded among other results the conclusion that Mozart would sometimes leave a work only partially complete (in sketch form) for a number of years, then finish it when an opportunity for performance arose.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Tyson (1987) ''Mozart: Studies of the Autograph Scores''.  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;   This in turn has been taken to support the view that Mozart carefully retained his sketches simply as a good business practice, keeping open the possibility of future performances and publication for works not immediately promising in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad, Ulrich (2006) "Compositional method," in Cliff Eisen and Simon P. Keefe, ''The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia''.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
The corpus of Beethoven's surviving sketches is substantial&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt; and frequently illustrates Beethoven's method of work, which was often slow and arduous. Commentary on Beethoven's finished works sometimes point to the extremely primitive or unpromising character of the themes as they first appear. For instance, [[Antony Hopkins]] pointed out the following sketch material for the [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]], remarking that it "bears more resemblance to a bugle-call than a symphony."&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
{
 \time 4/4 
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 4 = 160
\key d \major 
d'4. a8 d' a d' fis' | a'4. fis'8 d' a d' fis' | a'2 fis'4 d' a1
}
&lt;/score&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He added, "One wonders why he bothered to commit such banalities to paper at all but it seems to have been an essential part of his creative procedure."&lt;ref&gt;Antony Hopkins (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven''. London: Heineman, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins's discussion (pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39) covers two further sketches, shown below:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
{
 \time 4/4 
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 4 = 160
\clef "bass"
\key d \major 
d2~ d8 cis d e | d2~ d8 cis d e | fis g a g fis e d fis | g2~ g8 fis g a  | g2~ g8 fis g a | g
}
&lt;/score&gt;

&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
{
 \time 4/4 
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 4 = 160
\key d \major 
d''2. d''16 cis'' d'' e'' | fis''2. fis''16 e'' fis'' g'' | a''4.. a''16 fis''4.. fis''16 | d''2~ d''4.. d''16 | fis''4.. fis''16 d''4.. d''16 | b'2
}
&lt;/score&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These can be seen to be gradually evolving toward the actual main theme of the first movement as it appears in the symphony:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
{
 \time 4/4 
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 4 = 160
\clef "bass"
\key d \major

&lt;/score&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Schubert===
[[File:Symphony No. 8 in B minor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Schubert's abandoned draft for the third movement of his ''Unfinished Symphony'']]
Sketches by [[Franz Schubert]] include the abandoned third movement of his [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|''Unfinished Symphony'']], and the fragment known as [[Piano Sonata in E minor, D 769A (Schubert)|Piano Sonata in E minor, D 769A]].{{sfn|Badura-Skoda|Branscombe|2008}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1951}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1978}}{{sfn|Hilmar|Jestremski|2004}}{{sfn|Kube|2009}}{{sfn|Newbould|1999}}{{sfn|Reed|1997}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1971}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1974–1976}}{{sfn|AGA 1884–1897}}{{sfn|NSA scores}}{{sfn|NSA II, 15}}{{sfn|NSA website}}{{sfn|Schubert-online}}

Among [[Schubert's symphonies]] there are several sketches for a symphony in [[D&amp;nbsp;major]]. In the first edition of the [[Deutsch catalogue]], these were grouped under {{D.|number=615}}, apart from the early {{D.|number=997}}. Apart from the completed [[Symphony No. 3 (Schubert)|Third Symphony, D&amp;nbsp;200]], there appear to be at least four independent sets of sketches for a symphonic work in that [[key (music)|key]]:{{sfn|Badura-Skoda|Branscombe|2008}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1951}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1978}}{{sfn|Hilmar|Jestremski|2004}}{{sfn|Kube|2009}}{{sfn|Newbould|1999}}{{sfn|Reed|1997}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1971}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1974–1976}}{{sfn|AGA 1884–1897}}{{sfn|NSA scores}}{{sfn|NSA II, 15}}{{sfn|NSA website}}{{sfn|Schubert-online}}
* [[Symphony, D. 2b (Schubert)|Symphony in D major, D.&amp;nbsp;2B]], formerly D&amp;nbsp;997 (1811?): fragment of the first movement is extant
* [[Symphony, D. 615 (Schubert)|Symphony in D major, D&amp;nbsp;615]] (1818): piano sketches of two movements are extant
* [[Symphony, D. 708a (Schubert)|Symphony in D major, D&amp;nbsp;708A]] (after 1820): piano sketches of all four movements are extant
* [[Symphony No. 10 (Schubert)|Symphony in D major, D&amp;nbsp;936A]], known as Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;10 (1828?): piano sketches of all three movements are extant
Also the four movements of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Schubert)|Seventh Symphony, D&amp;nbsp;729]], in [[E major]] (1821), only survive as sketches.{{sfn|Badura-Skoda|Branscombe|2008}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1951}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1978}}{{sfn|Hilmar|Jestremski|2004}}{{sfn|Kube|2009}}{{sfn|Newbould|1999}}{{sfn|Reed|1997}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1971}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1974–1976}}{{sfn|AGA 1884–1897}}{{sfn|NSA scores}}{{sfn|NSA II, 15}}{{sfn|NSA website}}{{sfn|Schubert-online}}

Schubert's unfinished piano music ranges from rejected sketches of a few bars (e.g. {{D.|number=309A}}) to fairly elaborate drafts with several complete movements (e.g. [[Piano Sonata in C major, D 840 (Schubert)|''Reliquie'' sonata]]). The sonata {{D.|number=568}} exists in two stages of development: the unfinished [[Piano Sonata in D-flat major, D 568 (Schubert)|draft version in D-flat major]], and the [[Piano Sonata in E-flat major, D 568 (Schubert)|four-movement E-flat major version]] which Schubert prepared for publication near the end of his life.{{sfn|Badura-Skoda|Branscombe|2008}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1951}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1978}}{{sfn|Hilmar|Jestremski|2004}}{{sfn|Kube|2009}}{{sfn|Newbould|1999}}{{sfn|Reed|1997}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1971}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1974–1976}}{{sfn|AGA 1884–1897}}{{sfn|NSA scores}}{{sfn|NSA II, 15}}{{sfn|NSA website}}{{sfn|Schubert-online}}

Also in other genres Schubert produced sketches and drafts, some abandoned, and some later developed into complete compositions:{{sfn|Badura-Skoda|Branscombe|2008}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1951}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1978}}{{sfn|Hilmar|Jestremski|2004}}{{sfn|Kube|2009}}{{sfn|Newbould|1999}}{{sfn|Reed|1997}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1971}}{{sfn|Van Hoorickx|1974–1976}}{{sfn|AGA 1884–1897}}{{sfn|NSA scores}}{{sfn|NSA II, 15}}{{sfn|NSA website}}{{sfn|Schubert-online}}
* One of Schubert's earliest compositions, the song {{D.|number=1A}}, survives as a draft without text.
* "[[Das war ich]]", D&amp;nbsp;[[deest]] (1816, formerly grouped with {{D.|number=174}}): one of Schubert's shortest sketches, a melody line he may have considered for setting a text by [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]], that is, the text of D&amp;nbsp;174
* Schubert composed [[String Trio (Schubert)|three string trios]], the first two of these only extant as abandoned sketches ({{D.|number=111A}} and [[D. 471|471]]), the third, {{D.|number=581}}, existing in a draft and a final version.
* [[Stage works by Franz Schubert|Schubert's stage works]] include several unfinished works that were at least half completed, such as ''[[Lazarus (Schubert)|Lazarus]]'', ''[[Sakuntala (opera)|Sakuntala]]'' and ''[[Der Graf von Gleichen]]'', as well as sketches that were abandoned after a few incomplete numbers (e.g. ''[[Rüdiger (opera)|Rüdiger]]'' and {{D.|number=982}}).

The '''Social Science Research Council''' ('''SSRC''') is a US-based independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing research in the [[social sciences]] and related disciplines. Established in Manhattan in 1923, it today maintains a headquarters in [[Brooklyn Heights]] with a staff of approximately 70, and small regional offices in other parts of the world on an as-needed basis.

The SSRC offers several [[Scholarship|fellowships]] to young researchers in the social sciences and related disciplines, mostly for overseas fieldwork.

__TOC__

==History==
===Early history===
The SSRC came into being in 1923 as a result of the initiative of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s committee on research, headed by the association's president, [[Charles E. Merriam]] (1874–1953), who was political science chair at the [[University of Chicago]] and an early champion of behaviorally oriented social science.&lt;ref name="Social Science"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/1F20C6E1-565F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70/ | title=Social Science Research Council, 1923-1998 | last= | first= | date=2001 | website=Social Science Research Council | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the [[American Economic Association]], the [[American Sociological Society]], and the [[American Statistical Association]] joined with Merriam and his associates in forming the world's first coordinating body of the social sciences.

Other national associations—in [[anthropology]], [[history]], and [[psychology]]—designated representatives to the new entity, named the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), in the year following its incorporation on December 27, 1924. (In subsequent years, the membership would expand to include representatives from [[law]], [[geography]], [[psychiatry]], and [[medicine]].)

To support its work, the SSRC turned not to the US government, whose support seemed more appropriate for the natural sciences, but to private foundations. For the first fifty years, well over three-quarters of the SSRC's funding was provided by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Carnegie Corporation]], and two [[Rockefeller]] philanthropies, the [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rockarch.org/collections/nonrockorgs/ssrc.php | title=Social Science Research Council Archives, 1924-1990 | last= | first= | date= | website=Rockefeller Archive Center | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSRC was part of a wider [[Progressive Era]] movement to develop organizations of expertise that could dispense disinterested knowledge to policymakers. These organizations would tap leading thinkers in various fields to think creatively about how to rid the nation of the social and political ills brought on by the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Other independent, nongovernmental, policy-minded institutions founded in that era included the [[American Law Institute]] (1923), the [[Brookings Institution]] (1927), and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Judis | first=John B. | date=1 March 2001 | title=The Paradox of American Democracy: Elites, Special Interests, and the Betrayal of Public Trust | url= | location= | publisher=Routledge Chapman Hall | page=19 | isbn=978-0415930260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's main distinguishing feature was its commitment to the advancement of research in the [[social sciences]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;According to an early boilerplate, the purpose of the SSRC was to "plan, foster, promote and develop research in the social field."&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other Progressive-Era institutions, the SSRC represented a new kind of hybrid—one that was in some ways defined more by what it wasn't than what it was. It was not a governmental body, thus was removed from the pressures of Washington and public calls for quick-fix solutions to social problems. It was not an academic association—so was freed from disciplinary boundaries. It was not a university and hence did not have to confront competing demands for services unrelated to research.&lt;ref name="Social Science" /&gt;

Along with Merriam, two individuals were especially vital to the SSRC's early success. One was [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]] (1874–1948), one of the founders of the [[New School for Social Research]] and a leading force behind the emergence of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] in the 1920s. The other was [[Beardsley Ruml]], who had trained in [[psychometrics]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Ruml was active in the early phases of Rockefeller philanthropies. He poured Rockefeller resources into the social sciences in general and the SSRC in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three men channeled their progressive values into the cause of empirical research and knowledge. In his 2001 history of the SSRC, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100610025918/http://marymount.mmm.edu/cgi-bin/MySQLdb?MYSQL_VIEW=%2Ffaculty%2Fview_one.txt&amp;webid=224 Kenton Worcester] highlighted four aspects of their founding vision that remain central to this day:&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Interdisciplinarity:''' The SSRC was constructed as a platform on which scholars from various disciplines and traditions (including the natural sciences and humanities) could come together in a spirit of problem-solving intellectual cross-fertilization.
# '''Intermediary role:''' The federal government was not prepared to put its weight behind a central funding agency for the social sciences. Thus the SSRC frequently acted as an intermediary between researchers and research-supporting foundations, assuming the functions of assessing research priorities and disbursing research funds.
# '''Institutional flexibility:''' The SSRC was designed to be as elastic as possible, to take advantage of changing social conditions and methods of investigation. Even in its early days, the Council’s research planning committees were expected to carry out their work for a limited span of time, and for the same reason fellowship programs were kept going only as long as they were judged to be effective.
# '''Scientific advance in the greater interests of society:''' The SSRC's founders believed that the social sciences should address real-world concerns. They wanted to see social science move in a more data-sensitive, empirical direction.

Starting in the mid-1920s the Council sponsored annual conferences and launched its Research Training Fellowships program.

Committees launched in the 1920s and 1930s included:
* Agriculture (1925–42)
* Crime (1925–32)
* Industrial Relations (1926–30)
* Business Research (1928–31)
* Pressure Groups and Propaganda (1931–34)
* Government Statistics and Information Services (1933–37)
* Social Security (1935–45)

One of the Council's first acts was to urge Congress to appropriate funds sufficient to allow the [[Library of Congress]] to publish an annual index of state laws. As early as 1923, the SSRC cooperated with the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in a study of human migration from a social standpoint, said to be the institution's first global endeavor.

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] served as a member of the Council's Advisory Committee on Business Research (1928–1931). After he became president, collaborations between administration officials, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Council staff, and Council networks led to the committee work that accompanied the formulation and implementation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the Council served as a bridge between the Roosevelt administration and the social sciences, working behind the scenes to ensure that qualified social scientists were placed with appropriate agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It joined forces with its humanities counterpart, the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS), and other partners to form the [[Ethnogeographic Board]], with the mission of providing information about unfamiliar societies with which the war was suddenly bringing Americans into contact. The Board developed a roster of people with specialized area knowledge and conducted a survey of nascent [[area studies]] programs in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
The identity of the Council in the latter half of the 20th century would closely overlap the development of [[area studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of [[modernization theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilman | first=Nils | date=15 February 2007 | title=Mandarins of the Future: Modernization Theory in Cold War America | url= | location= | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | page= | isbn=978-0801886331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of World War II, there was widespread consensus on the need for the United States to invest in international studies. Liberals and conservatives alike viewed the creation of a large brain trust of internationally oriented political scientists and economists as an urgent national priority. There was considerable tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought that social scientists should seek to develop overarching macrohistorical theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became [[area studies]] advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

In this context, the postwar SSRC had two separate agendas, which to some extent were at odds with each other because they entailed very different sets of methodological commitments: [[ideographic]] versus [[nomothetic]]. On the one hand, the SSRC was keen to join forces with the country's major foundations—most notably, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]—to promote area studies. For this agenda, it already had a natural institutional partner, the ACLS; indeed, the two councils had worked during the war mapping out US-based foreign studies. 

On the other hand, the SSRC also wished to promote behavioralist social science—an agenda that directly descended from [[Charles Merriam]]'s prewar concerns.

To further its interests in area studies, the SSRC teamed up with the ACLS in administering Area Research Training Fellowships with funds from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] and in forming the Committee on World Area Research. In the words of SSRC historian Eldrige Sibley: "[T]his committee served as the primary planning, coordinating and evaluating agency at the national level for the entire foreign area and language movement in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

To further its behavioralist agenda, the SSRC set up various other committees—including, most notably, the Committee on Political Behavior, organized in 1945 by [[Pendelton Herring]] and headed at various times by [[David Truman]], [[David Easton]], and [[Robert Dahl]], all of whom would serve as presidents of the [[American Political Science Association]]; and the [[Committee on Comparative Politics]], organized in 1953 and headed by [[Gabriel Almond]] and then [[Lucian Pye]], both of whom also became APSA presidents.

The SSRC's agenda for the behavioral social sciences largely came apart in the 1970s, leaving area studies as its central platform. By then, the SSRC and the ACLS had emerged as the national nexus for raising and administering funds for area studies. They created and managed about a dozen joint committees covering:
* Africa (1960–96)
* China (1981–96)
* Eastern Europe (1971–96)
* Japan (1967–96)
* Korea (1967–96)
* Latin America (1942–47; 1959–96)
* Muslim Societies (1985–93)
* Near and Middle East (1959–96)
* South Asia (1976–96)
* Southeast Asia (1976–96)
* Soviet Union (1983–96) [successor to Committee on Slavic and East European Studies (1971–77) and Slavic and East European Studies Committee (1948–71)]
* Western Europe (1975–96)

The joint SSRC-ACLS committees would accomplish most of their work—field development workshops, conferences, and publications—with funding from the [[Ford Foundation]]. In 1972 Ford conferred to the two councils the responsibility for managing its centerpiece program, the Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/multi/interaction/0507/area.html | title=The new world of area studies | last=Goldstein | first=Judith | date=2007 | website=Stanford University | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Szanton | first=David | date=September 2004 | title=The Politics of Knowledge Area Studies and the Disciplines | url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520245365/the-politics-of-knowledge | location= | publisher=University of California | page= | isbn=9780520245365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 30 years, the SSRC and the ACLS would award approximately 3,000 area studies dissertation fellowships and, with funds from other foundations as well, another 2,800 postdoctoral area studies research grants. In Kenton Worcester's words: "The cumulative total of awards for field research outside the United States was staggering."&lt;ref&gt;Statistics are from Worcester, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual reports of the SSRC indicate that the area committees had an impressive record of productivity and influence on area studies and the disciplines they encompassed.&lt;ref&gt;David Ludden, "Area Studies in the Age of Globalization," 1/25/98 paper. http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/areast2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, scholars appeared to appreciate the fertile ground the SSRC/ACLS area committees provided for interdisciplinary scholarship. As Korea specialist [[Bruce Cumings]] put it: "For decades [these committees] offered a rare venue where one could see what a historian thought of the work of an economist, or what a literary critic thought of behavioralist sociology." According to Cumings, the SSRC was particularly appreciated as a meeting ground between traditional social science disciplines and area studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23. See also Szanton, ''The Politics of Knowledge'', p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when area studies occupied center stage, the SSRC continued to support advanced research on social themes of the day. In the 1970s and 1980s, it convened committees addressing such topics as cognitive research, law and social science, international peace and security, states and social structures, the urban underclass, and urban migration.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council's forays into non-area studies were limited, however, by the challenges of the funding environment. In the immediate postwar period, the SSRC had benefited from unprecedented federal support of social and domestic programs, as well as increased public attention to social science research. But the growing tide of American [[conservatism]], begun in the 1950s, eventually led to a populist backlash against federal funding of social research. By the time President [[Ronald Reagan]] assumed office, the political atmosphere had soured over the role of the social sciences and public investment in social research.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War===
The end of the [[Cold War]] and the quickening pace of globalization turned the future of area studies into the number one issue for Council management in the concluding years of the 20th century. Under the stewardship of four successive presidents—[[David Featherman]] (1989–1995), [[Kenneth Prewitt]] (1995–1098), [[Orville Gilbert Brim Jr.]] (1998–1999), and [[Craig Calhoun]] (1999–2012)—the SSRC closed down its area committees in favor of a reorganized international program with thematic, cross-regional, and cross-cultural components. According to this vision, the area studies field would be transformed and integrated into traditional social science disciplines—especially, [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]]. Emphasis would shift from country and area to theme and context-sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Heginbotham, 'Rethinking International Scholarship: The Challenge of Transition from the Cold War Era," ''Items'' 48.2-3 (June–September 1996), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSRC's records are stored in the [http://www.rockarch.org/ Rockefeller Archive Center], North Tarrytown, New York.

===Past presidents===

==Fellowships and other awards==
Since 1923, the SSRC has funded the research of over ten thousand fellows. Most SSRC fellowships are conducted through annual, peer-reviewed competitions and offer support for predissertation, dissertation, and postdoctoral work. And, although most SSRC fellowships target the social sciences, a number also engage the humanities, the natural sciences, and relevant professional and practitioner communities.

The SSRC established the [http://www.ssrc.org/hirschman Albert O. Hirschman Prize] in 2007 to recognize academic excellence in international, interdisciplinary social science research, theory, and public communication in the tradition of German-born American economist [[Albert Hirschman]]. The first two Hirschman Prize recipients are [[Dani Rodrik]] (2007) and [[Charles Tilly]] (2008). The latter received the prize just weeks before his death.

===Digital Forums===
Since 2001, the SSRC has launched a series of [https://archive.is/20130620195705/http://www.ssrc.org/pages/digital-forums/ digital forums]. Active forums include African Futures, [[The Immanent Frame]], Kujenga Amani, the Democracy Papers, or Reverberations.

==Notable fellows and committee members==
Pioneering American political scientist [[Gabriel Almond]] (1911–2002) held awards from the SSRC in 1935–1936 and again in 1946–1947. While serving on an SSRC committee, he accomplished critical work in the development of comparative politics as a field.

Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Ralph J. Bunche]] (1903–1971) held an SSRC research training fellowship in 1936–1938.

Presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]] (born 1918) has held two SSRC awards: a demobilization award in 1946–1947, and a research training award in 1949.

Historian [[John Hope Franklin]] (1915–2009) was a recipient of an SSRC fellowship in the early part of his career. From 1956 to 1961, he served on the SSRC's long-running Grants-in-Aid Committee.

Canadian-American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908–2006) had a research training fellowship in 1937–1938.

Historian [[Peter Gay]] (born 1923) was a research training fellow in 1950–1951.

[[Morris Janowitz]] (1919–1988), a prominent sociologist at the University of Chicago who specialized in the sociology of the military, received a demobilization award, 1946–1947.

[[Simon Kuznets]] (1901–1985), a Nobel laureate in economics, led the SSRC Committee on Economic Growth from 1949–1968. His long involvement with the SSRC began in 1925, when he was a research fellow studying economic patterns in prices. In 1961, Kuznets headed a new SSRC committee on the Economy of China.

[[Harold D. Lasswell]] (1902–1978) was among the earliest SSRC research fellows (1928–1929). He went on to become a prominent political scientist and president of ASPA.

[[Owen Lattimore]] (1900–1089), a prominent anthropologist of China and Central Asia, especially Mongolia, held a research fellowship in 1929–1930.

Political sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] (1922–2006) held a field fellowship in 1945–1946. One of the results was his award-winning book ''[[Political Man]]'' (1960), which remains thought provoking to this day.

'''Solemyidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of saltwater clams, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] protobranch [[bivalve]] [[mollusk]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Solemyoida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur William Baden Powell|Powell A. W. B.]], ''New Zealand Mollusca'', [[HarperCollins|William Collins Publishers Ltd]], Auckland, New Zealand (1979) {{ISBN|0-00-216906-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Solemyids are remarkable in that their digestive tract is either extremely small or non-existent, and their feeding appendages are too short to reach outside the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Reid R. G. B. (1989) The unwhole organism. [http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/3/1133/ American Zoologist 29:1133-1140]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that these clams host [[sulphur]]-[[oxidizing]] [[bacteria]] intracellularly within their [[gill]] filaments. As [[chemoautotrophs]], these bacterial [[symbionts]] synthesize organic matter from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and are the primary source of nutrition for the whole organism.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh C. M., Abbott M. S., Veenhuis M. (1988) Immunochemical localization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in the symbiont-containing gills of Solemya velum (Bivalvia, Mollusca). [http://www.pnas.org/content/85/20/7786 PNAS 85:7786–7789]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart F. J., Cavanaugh, C. M. (2006) Bacterial endosymbioses in Solemya (Mollusca: Bivalvia) – Model systems for studies of symbiont-host adaptation. [http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 90: 343-360] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130202220900/http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the animal host provides its symbionts a habitat in which they have access to the substrates of chemoautotrophy (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced inorganic compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Together, these partners create "animals" with novel metabolic capabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">The '''Sono arsenic filter''' was invented in 2006 by [[Abul Hussam]], who is a chemistry professor at [[George Mason University]] (GMU) in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Virginia]]. It was developed to deal with the problem of [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]].&lt;ref name="HussamMunir2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hussam|first1=Abul|last2=Munir|first2=Abul K. M.|title=A simple and effective arsenic filter based on composite iron matrix: Development and deployment studies for groundwater of Bangladesh|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A|volume=42|issue=12|year=2007|pages=1869–1878|doi=10.1080/10934520701567122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[water filter|filter]] is now in use in Hussam's native [[Bangladesh]].

==Development==
Farmers had been drinking fresh [[groundwater]] from wells, whereas previously they had had to use ponds and mudholes which were contaminated with bacteria and viruses. However, the wells were also contaminated with naturally occurring high concentrations of poisonous [[arsenic]], causing skin ailments and cancers. Awareness of the problem developed through the 1990s.

Allan Smith, an [[epidemiologist]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], observed that the arsenic problem affects millions of people worldwide:
{{quote|You can't see it or taste or smell it. The idea that crystal-clear drinking water would end up causing lung disease in 20 or 30 years is a little weird. It's unbelievable to people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}}}

Hussam developed his filter after years of testing hundreds of prototypes. The final version contains 20 pounds of shards of porous [[iron]], which bonds chemically with arsenic. It also includes charcoal, sand and bits of brick. It filters nearly all of the arsenic from the well water.

==Awards==
Hussam was awarded the 2007 [[Grainger challenge]] Prize for [[Sustainability]] by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name=nationalacademies&gt;[[National Academies]] [http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02012007 Press Release], accessed 5 Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hussam plans to use 70% of the $1 million engineering prize to distribute filters to needy communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.com/sci.html?id=833&amp;ref=rss Professor wins $1 million for arsenic filter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206142405/http://www.enn.com/sci.html?id=833 |date=2007-02-06 }}, Associated Press, 2/3/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of mediation''', which is the principal referent of the research group of the [http://www.sites.univ-rennes2.fr/las/lirl/pages/niveau1/lirlenglish.html Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Language Research] (L.I.R.L.), is a theoretic model developed at [[Rennes]] (France) since the 1960' by Professor [[Gagnepain Jean|Jean Gagnepain]], linguist and [[Epistemology|epistemologist]]. This model, whose principles Jean Gagnepain has methodically set forth in his three volume study ''On Meaning'' (''Du Vouloir Dire''),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eidcPOFI8uwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire I], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_1xqJSorZXAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire II], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; covers the whole field of the [[human science]]s. One essential feature of the theory is that it seeks to find a kind of experimental verification of its theorems in the clinic of [[psychopathology]]. For this reason, the theory presents itself as a "clinical anthropology".

The theoretic model developed by Gagnepain and his research group at Rennes has inspired the work of professors and researchers in a number of [[European countries]] and in the [[United States]] in a wide variety of disciplinary fields, among them [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[psychology]], [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[theology]]. Its aim is deliberately trans-disciplinary - or, as Gagnepain humorously puts it, the theory of mediation cultivates "in-discipline".

== A theory of culture ==

This model, originally developed with respect to language, today takes for its object the entirety of what is called "the cultural", that is, the dimension that specifies human beings and distinguishes them from other living species. In other words, "the cultural" constitutes the specific order of reality in which only human beings participate. It is the cultural order that permits human beings, while remaining natural beings, to constantly transcend their natural being in abstracting themselves from it.

The theory of mediation understands the cultural order - more simply, culture - not as the totality of the essential works of a society, nor as the general state of a given civilization, but as the ensemble of properly human capacities which, absent pathological conditions, all human beings share regardless of their historical epoch or geographical setting. For the theory of mediation, culture and reason - the "rationality" which philosophers have discussed for centuries - are identical. The human sciences, understood as the theory of mediation understands them, take up in their own distinctive fashion the questions which philosophy has treated only speculatively.

== A clinical anthropology ==

Gagnepain's work shows, on the basis of what the clinic forces us to recognize, that human reason is diffracted. In other words, rationality in human beings has several different forms which the clinic requires us to dissociate. Reason is logical, to be sure, but it is equally and just as fundamentally technical, ethnical, and ethical. There is no hierarchy among these different "planes" or "levels" of rationality that constitute psychic life.

On each of these planes or levels, human being mediate their relations to the world and others (thus the term "mediation"). Unlike the other animals, human beings are not limited to what their immediate physiological capacities allow them to grasp. They can stand back from, or take a distance from, their natural insertion in the world and can elaborate those cultural mediations that are constitutive of a properly human reality.

In Kantian terms, it is a question of passing from a description of an already constituted reason to an explanation of a constituting reason. It is a question, therefore, of accounting for that in human beings which, without their knowing it, makes them capable of posing the world - and of posing it not only in one way, by knowing it, as the traditional analysis holds, but in four different ways on the basis of four different capacities.

To be sure, human beings manifest the world in and across the words they speak : with them, they designate the world and explain it to themselves. In so doing, they realize their logical capacity. Human beings also manifest the world in and across their tools : with them, they fabricate the world and, in doing so, they realize their technical capacity. Human beings likewise manifest the world in originating their histories and societies, realizations not of their logical or their technical capacities but of their ethnic capacity. Finally, human beings manifest the world in the norms and regulations to which they submit their desires. Here is it question of their ethical capacity.

The possible autonomisation of the four planes (or levels or modes) of our rationality is revealed by the clinic. Although "normally" the four modes of our rationality function together in such a way that it is hardly possible to distinguish them, pathologically it does become possible to distinguish them, as, for example, when one mode of rationality ceases to function in an afflicted person whereas the others continue to do so. Each plane of rationality has its specific pathology. The pathology specific to the logical plane is [[aphasia]]; the pathology specific to the technical plane is atechnia ; the pathology specific to the ethnical plane is [[psychosis]] (and [[Paraphilia|perversion]]) ; the pathology specific to the ethical plane is [[neurosis]] (and psychopathic conditions).

In other words, pathology dissociates what normally cannot be distinguished and puts into evidence processes otherwise unseen. In this way, as [[Freud]] recognized, pathology provides a veritable analysis, that is, a breakdown, of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;"On the other hand, we are familiar with the notion that pathology, by making things larger and coarser, can draw our attention to normal conditions which would otherwise have escaped us. Where it points to a breach or a rent, there may normally be an articulation present. If we throw a crystal to the floor, it breaks; but not into haphazard pieces. It comes apart along its lines of cleavage into fragments whose boundaries, though they were invisible, were predetermined by the crystal’s structure. Mental patients are split and broken structures of this same kind. [...] They have turned away from external reality, but for that very reason they know more about internal, psychical reality and can reveal a number of things to us that would otherwise be inaccessible to us." (S. Freund, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'', lecture XXXI, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Gagnepain therefore makes it a methodological rule "to admit or to impute to a system only those dissociations that are pathologically verifiable."

In [[human sexuality]], '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' are [[sex position]]s during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Men who have sex with men|between two men]]. A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.  A ''{{visible anchor|service top}}'' is "one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom".&lt;ref name="DJ Symptomatic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Carissa|title=It's Symptomatic|url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/its-symptomatic...-by-carissa-rodriguez|website=Document Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile top}}'' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatiletop.htm Versatile Top].

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233–9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "Männer, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, Präventionsmedizin für den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D.

Versatility is a concept of [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="martinplevine1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Martin P. |authorlink= |author2=Kimmel, Michael S.  |title=Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the homosexual Clone |year=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Versatility'', though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.&lt;ref name="jayyoung1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Karla |authorlink= |author2=Young, Allen  |title=The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles |year=1979 |publisher=Summit |location=New York |isbn=0-671-40013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''Männlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: Ennennäkemätöntä – Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming – How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles].

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

Waldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the [[American Association of Teachers of German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aatg.org/programs/kinder-lernen-deutsch/189-kld-centers-of-excellence.html|title= New Center of Excellence in 2010|work=AATG KLD Centers of Excellence|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Waldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA]]. In 1961, the first two-week session of "Camp Waldsee" was held for 72 villagers.&lt;ref name="clv history"/&gt; The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first "adventure program," Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in [[Montana]], where villagers learned German while enjoying [[hiking|hikes]] in the mountains and [[horseback riding]]. 

In 1970, the [[high school]] credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first [[study abroad]] program, offering [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] and [[biking]] trips to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. 

In the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. 

In 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major "Waldseefest" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.

===World connections===
Waldsee enjoys a continuing [[sister city]] relationship with the German town of [[Bad Waldsee]], located in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. 

[[Horst Köhler]], the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, [[Roman Herzog]]. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.&lt;ref name="clv history"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.

The German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the [[American Association of Teachers of German]] and the [[Goethe Institut]] Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Basler Zeitung]], [[ZDF]] German Television, [[CBS]] American Television, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[German Life Magazine]]'', ''Oskar's'' and ''[[Deutschland (magazine)|Deutschland]]'' magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. 

===Daily life===
[[Image:Waldsee, Bemidji Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|Waldsee ''Marktplatz.'' The ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen at left, and the ''Bahnhof'' is in the background.]]
Waldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.

The Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (''die Gruene Welle'') and in [[medieval history]] and [[theater]] (''der Maerchenwald''). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. 

Waldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing [[FM radio]] broadcasts at a live [[radio station]], learning about [[Swiss culture]] in tandem with the nearby French village [[Lac du Bois (camp)|Lac du Bois]] and the Italian village [[Lago del Bosco]], learning about the [[Natural environment|environment]], performing [[improvisational theater]] based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. 

Villagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from [[soccer]] to [[fencing]]. There is also traditional American [[Summer camp|camp]] activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[canoeing]] at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant [[chess]] sets and a giant Mühle ([[Nine Men's Morris]]) game.

===Locations ===
Waldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]]. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.

====Permanent site====
[[Image:WaldseeBemidjiMarktplatzAtDusk.jpg|thumb|left|Waldsee ''Marktplatz'' near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. The culturally authentic ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen in the background.]]
The Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at {{Coord|47|33|33.78|N|94|44|19.36|W|type:landmark_region:US}} near [[Bemidji]], Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other [[Concordia Language Village]] sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).

The site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a ''Marktplatz'', which is the center of most activity at ''Waldsee''. The ''Bahnhof'' is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The ''Gasthof'' is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named ''[[Worpswede]]'', which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. 

The first building on the campsite was "''Haus Katja''", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the ''[[Schwarzwaldhaus]]'' or [[Black Forest house]], which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the ''Schwarzwaldhaus'' is the ''Max Kade Haus'', which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. 

Two new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The ''Erich Markel Haus'' (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The ''Robert Bosch Haus'' houses the healthcare center (''Heilbronn'') and another residence (''Stuttgart''). The newest building at ''Waldsee'' is the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America. The ''BioHaus'' is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also ''Café Einbeck'', where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. ''Waldsee'' also has a ''Laden'' at which villagers can make purchases using ''Euro''.

====Leased sites====
Waldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], [[Vergas, Minnesota]], Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and [[Cass Lake, Minnesota]]. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for [[Al-Wāḥa]], the [[Arabic]] language village, which was founded that year.

====Abroad====
Waldsee travels abroad to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.


==BioHaus (Passive House)==
In 2006, Waldsee opened the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America, on its permanent site near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the [[Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt]] (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the BioHaus won the [[Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award]] in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the [[World Clean Energy Award]] in the construction category.&lt;ref name="initiative"&gt;{{cite web

===Cultural importance===
The fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the "new Germany" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the [[Bauhaus]] school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into [[West German]] government buildings post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web

===Design===
The house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

Water in the house is heated by [[solar hot water|solar thermal heat panels]] on the roof, rather than [[photovoltaic]] solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt;

Low-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt; Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.&lt;ref name="initiative"/&gt;
