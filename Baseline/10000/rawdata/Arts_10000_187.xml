'''''8 Mile''''' is a 2001 American [[Hip hop]] based [[drama film]] written by [[Scott Silver]], directed by [[Curtis Hanson]], and starring [[Eminem]], [[Mekhi Phifer]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Michael Shannon]], and [[Kim Basinger]]. The film is based loosely on Eminem's actual upbringing, and follows white rapper B-Rabbit (Eminem) and his attempt to launch a career in a genre dominated by African-Americans. The title is derived from [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]], the highway between the predominantly black city of [[Detroit]] and [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] and the predominantly white [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] and [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] suburbs. It was filmed mostly on location.

''8 Mile'' was a critical and commercial success. Eminem won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "[[Lose Yourself]]".

==Plot==
In 1995 [[Detroit]], Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith Jr. is a young, unhappy [[blue-collar worker]] from a poor family. He has moved back north of [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] to the run-down trailer home in [[Warren, Michigan]] of his [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother Stephanie, his little sister Lily, and Stephanie's abusive live-in boyfriend Greg. Although encouraged by his friends, Jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. He falters during a [[Battle rap|rap battle]] one night at a local venue, the Shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated.

Jimmy works at a car factory. When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs and dismisses his request on account of his habitual tardiness. Jimmy befriends a woman named Alex. Over time, Jimmy begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life. When he exhibits an improved attitude and performance at work, his supervisor grants him the extra shifts he requested.

Stephanie receives an eviction notice as she cannot pay rent. Despite Stephanie's best attempts to keep the eviction notice a secret, Greg finds out about it. A fight ensues between him and Jimmy, and Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy's friendship with Wink, a radio DJ with ties to a record label promoter, becomes strained after he discovers that Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, a rap group known as the "Leaders of the Free World." At one point, Jimmy and his friends get into a violent brawl with the Leaders, which is disrupted when Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob pulls out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg; he survives but is confined to crutches.

At work one day when on lunch break, Jimmy witnesses a rap battle in which an employee insults a gay co-worker, Paul. Jimmy joins the battle and defends Paul. Alex is impressed by Jimmy's actions; they have sex in the factory. Wink arranges for Jimmy to meet with producers at a recording studio, but Jimmy finds Wink and Alex engaging in intercourse. Enraged, Jimmy attacks Wink as Alex tries to break up their altercation. In retaliation, Wink and the Leaders of the Free World assault Jimmy outside his mother's trailer. The leader of the gang, Papa Doc, holds Jimmy at gunpoint, threatening to kill him before being dissuaded by Wink.

Jimmy's best friend and battle host, Future, pushes him to get revenge by competing against the Leaders of the Free World at the next rap battle. However, Jimmy's late-night shift conflicts with the timing of the next battle tournament. A goodbye visit from Alex, who is moving to New York, changes his mind about competing, and Paul agrees to cover his shift at work as a favor while Jimmy goes to the battle.

In all rounds of the rap battle, Jimmy has to compete against one member of "the Leaders." After winning the first two rounds, he faces off against Papa Doc and ultimately wins by exposing all of his opponent's weaknesses as well as his own. With nothing to say in rebuttal, Papa Doc hands the microphone back to Future, embarrassed. After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Jimmy is offered a position by Future, hosting battles at The Shelter. Jimmy declines, saying he has to get back to work and to find success his own way.

==Reception==

===Controversy===
When B-Rabbit raps against Lil' Tic in the first battle the instrumental used was 'Time's Up' produced by [[Buckwild]] featuring  [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]]. It was revealed by O.C. on the March 6, 2017 episode of Doggie Diamonds No Filter that this sample was never properly cleared with O.C. and Buckwild when the movie was first released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-VQdfKNh6U|title=O.C. - Eminem Didn't Clear 'Times Up' Before He Used It In 8 Mile Movie|first=|last=DoggieDiamondsTV|date=6 March 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[VHS]] version was also released on the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117883362?refCatId=13 | title='8 Mile' DVD's going far | work=Variety | date=2003-03-24 | accessdate=2011-09-20 | first=Scott | last=Hettrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eminem-stars-in-8-mile-coming-to-dvd-and-vhs-march-18-2003-74102432.html | title=Eminem Stars in '8 MILE' Coming to DVD and VHS March 18, 2003 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=2003-01-30 | accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crtitical Reception===
is that "Even though the story is overly familiar, there's enough here for an engaging ride."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/8_mile/ |title=''8 Mile'' Movie Reviews |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2008-07-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080730041624/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/8_mile/| archivedate=2008-07-30 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has rating score of 77 based on 38 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/8-mile|title=8 Mile|website=Metacritic |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave ''8 Mile'' was B+ on an A+ to F scale, with the core under-21 demographics giving it an A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/hamann/nov10wrapup.asp|title=Box Office Prophets: Box Office Report for November 8-10, 2002|website=Box Office Prophets|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He said that we "are hardly started in ''8 Mile'', and already we see that this movie stands aside from routine debut films by pop stars" and that it is "a faithful reflection of his myth". He said that Eminem, as an actor, is "convincing without being too electric" and "survives the X-ray truth-telling of the movie camera"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021108/REVIEWS/211080301/1023 |title=''8 Mile'' |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper]]'' review, both Ebert and [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a thumbs up; Roeper said that Eminem has a "winning screen presence" and "raw magic" to him. He was happy with Rabbit's "tender side" presented through his relationship with the "adorable" Greenfield as his sister, but felt that Basinger was "really miscast". Roeper said: "8 Mile probably won't win converts to rap, but it should thrill Eminem fans."&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.tvplex.go.com/ebertandthemovies/audioplayer.cgi?file=021111_8_mile{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. He said that ''8 Mile'' "is a real movie, not a fast-buck package to exploit the fan base of a rap nonentity" that "qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of Eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap." He praised Hanson's directing and the performances, and compared the final battle with Papa Doc to the fight between [[Rocky Balboa]] and [[Apollo Creed]] in ''[[Rocky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/8-mile-20021108|title=8 Mile|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3646">'''Apparatus theory''', derived in part from [[Marxist film theory]], [[semiotics]], and [[psychoanalysis]], was a dominant theory within [[film theory|cinema studies]] during the 1970s, following the 1960s when psychoanalytical theories for film were popular.  

==Overview==
Apparatus theory maintains that cinema is by nature [[ideological]] because its mechanics of representation are ideological and because the films are created to represent reality. Its mechanics of representation include the [[camera]] and [[Film editing|editing]]. The central position of the spectator within the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of the composition is also ideological. In the simplest instance the cinematic apparatus purports to set before the eye and ear realistic images and sounds. However, the technology disguises how that reality is put together frame by frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ponsford|first1=Nicole|title=Film Theory and Language|url=http://media.edusites.co.uk/category/c/apparatus-theory/|website=Media.Edu|publisher=Media.edu|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning of a film, plus the way the viewing subject is constructed and the mechanics of the actual process and production of making the film affect the representation of the subject. Apparatus theory also states that within the text's perspective, the central position of the viewer is ideological. This effect is ideological because it is a reproduced reality and the cinematic experience affects the viewer on a deep level. 
This theory is explored in the work of Jean-Louis Baudry. This is where the Marxist aspect of the theory comes into play. The idea is that the passive viewers (or Marx's proletariat) cannot tell the difference between the world of cinema and film and the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematic apparatus|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/cbehler/glossary/cinematicapparatus.html|website=faculty.washington.edu|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These viewers identify with the characters on screen so strongly that they become susceptible to ideological positioning. In Baudry's theory of the apparatus he likens the movie-goer to someone in a dream. He relates the similarities of being in a darkened room, having someone else control your actions/what you do, and the inactivity and passivity of the two activities. He goes on to say that because movie-goers are not distracted by outside light, noise, etc., due to the nature of a movie theater, they are able to experience the film as if it were reality and they were experiencing the events themselves. 
Apparatus theory also argues that cinema maintains the dominant ideology of the culture within the viewer. Ideology is not imposed on cinema, but is part of its nature and it shapes the way the audience thinks.

Apparatus theory follows an institutional model of [[spectatorship]].

== Apparatus theorists ==

[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerve et Arachne (Versailles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Minerva]] and Arachne'', [[René-Antoine Houasse]], 1706]]

In [[Greek mythology]] (and later [[Roman mythology]]), '''Arachne''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|æ|k|n|iː}}; from {{lang-grc-gre|ἀράχνη}} "spider", cognate with [[Latin]] ''[[araneus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; was a talented mortal weaver who challenged [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest; this [[hubris]] resulted in her being transformed into a [[spider]]. There are many versions of the story's weaving contest, with each saying that one or the other won.

== Biography ==
Arachne was a [[Lydians|Lydian]] maiden who was the daughter of [[Idmon]] of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], who was a famous dyer in purple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 6. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited to have invented linen cloth and nets while her son Closter introduced the use of spindle in the manufacture of wool. She was said to have been a native of [[Hypaepa|Hypæpæ]], near Colophon in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=7:chapter=57&amp;highlight=arabus#note10 Book 7.56.3];'' According to Justin, B. ii. c. 6, the Athenians introduced the use of wool among their countrymen; but it has been supposed that they learned it from the Egyptians. As we have sufficient evidence that linen was manufactured by the Egyptians at a very early period, we may presume that this account of Arachne is either fabulous, or that, in some way or other, she was instrumental in the introduction of linen into Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Ovid's version===
[[File:Antonio Tempesta Arachne.jpg|thumb|''[[Athena]] and Arachne'' ([[Antonio Tempesta]])]]

One version appears in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of the Roman poet [[Ovid]].

In this version, Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than that of Athena, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, in part at least, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned: "You can never compare to any of the gods. Plead for forgiveness and Athena might spare your soul."

"Ha! I only speak the truth and if Athena thinks otherwise then let her come down and challenge me herself," Arachne replied. Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white chiton. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods had misled and abused mortals, particularly Zeus, tricking and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times. Terrified and ashamed, Arachne hanged herself. Then Athena said, "Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless in
future, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!" After saying this she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate's herb, and immediately at the touch of this dark poison, Arachne's hair fell out. With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kline|first1=A.S,|title=Ovid - the Metamophoses|url=http://tikaboo.com/library/Ovid-Metamorphosis.pdf|website=Tikaboo|publisher=A.S. kline|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed how goddesses punished mortals who dared to insult them.

==Influence==
[[File:Velazquez-las hilanderas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|''The Spinners, or, The Fable of Arachne'']] (1644–48) by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]].]]
The [[Linnaean taxonomy|taxonomical]] class name ''[[Arachnida]]'' and the name for spiders in many [[romance languages]] are both derived from ''arachne''.

The metamorphosis of Arachne in Ovid's telling furnished material for an episode in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s mock-heroic ''[[Muiopotmos]]'', 257–352.&lt;ref&gt;Written c. 1590 and published in ''[[Complaints (Spenser)|Complaints]]'', 1591. Spenser's allusion to Arachne in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ii, xii.77, is also noted in Reed Smith, "The Metamorphoses in ''Muiopotmos''" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''28'''.3 (March 1913), pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Spenser's adaptation, which "rereads an Ovidian story in terms of the Elizabethan world" is designed to provide a rationale for the hatred of Arachne's descendent Aragnoll for the butterfly-hero Clarion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Brinkley, "Spenser's ''Muiopotmos'' and the Politics of Metamorphosis" ''[[ELH]]'' '''48'''.4 (Winter 1981, pp. 668-676) p 670. Brinkley makes a case for Spenser's episode as political allegory of Elizabeth's court.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] uses Arachne in [[Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)|Canto XVII]] of ''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', to describe the horrible monster [[Geryon]]. "... his back and all his belly and both flanks were painted arabesques and curlicues: the Turks and Tartars never made a fabric with richer colors intricately woven, nor were such complex webs spun by Arachne."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''The Divine Comedy, Volume 1: Inferno''. Canto XVII, lines 15-18 (pp. 223-224). Translated by Mark Musa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tale of Arachne inspired one of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]' most factual paintings: ''[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]'' ("The Spinners, or The fable of Arachne", in the [[Prado]]), in which the painter represents the two important moments of the myth. In the front, the contest of Arachne and the goddess (the young and the old weaver), in the back, an ''Abduction of Europa'' that is a copy of [[Titian]]'s version (or maybe of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]' copy of Titian). In front of it appears Minerva (Athena) at the moment she punishes Arachne. It transforms the myth into a reflection about creation and imitation, god and man, master and pupil (and therefore about the nature of art).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La légende d'Arachné|url=http://www.cineclubdecaen.com/peinture/peintres/velazquez/arachne.htm|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that [[Jeremias Gotthelf]]'s nineteenth century novella, ''[[The Black Spider]]'', was heavily influenced by the Arachne story from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Gallagher, "The Transmission of Ovid's Arachne Metamorphosis in Jeremias Gotthelf's Die Schwarze Spinne"'', Neophilologus ''(2008) 92: 699-711&lt;/ref&gt; In the novella, a woman is turned into a venomous spider having reneged on a deal with the devil.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Pendule met Arachne en Athene - Meissen porselein 001.JPG|thumb|Pendule with Arachne and Athena in [[Meissen porcelain]], attributed to Johann Gottlieb Kirchner and George Fritzsche (1727)]]
Arachne has had a considerable degree of influence on modern popular culture. She frequently appears in modern [[fantasy]] books, movies, and television series in the form of a monstrous spider. In ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', she is pictured as a grotesque, half-woman, half-spider monster who nests on people to produce killer spiders. She is the central character in the 2011 novel ''The Spider Goddess'' by [[Tara Moss]]. In ''[[Class of the Titans]]'', Arachne is changed into a giant spider and makes a deal with Cronus to become human again. Cronus does not hold up the end of his bargain though and betrays her after getting her to trap the heroes for him. After being berated by Atlanta, Athena turns Arachne back into a human, and she is allowed to live at the Olympus High School, weaving for the gods.

In the 13th episode from season 6 of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', "Unforgiven", the monster of the week is an Arachne, depicted as a humanoid monster with spider-like attributes and abilities, including the ability to weave strong webs and a poisonous bite that can turn other humans into Arachnes. They can only be killed by decapitation and before one appeared in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] hadn't been seen in 2,000 years. While soulless, [[Sam Winchester]] hunted one, but was unaware that it had turned its victims into Arachnes as well. One of the turned victims comes back for revenge and Sam is forced to kill him. 

Arachne is also featured in the ''[[Percy Jackson]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'' series. All of Athena's children, including Annabeth Chase, are arachnophobic because of Arachne's dispute with Athena. Arachne appears towards the end of ''[[The Mark of Athena]]'' as a large spider while still maintaining human features. She is defeated by Annabeth because of her pride and eventually they are both sent falling into [[Tartarus]], where Percy Jackson kills Arachne.

In the novel ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a plain brown spider is bewitched into believing that she is Arachne until the witch who enchanted her is killed. She is mentioned to be one of the creatures in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. The book describes Arachne as "'...the greatest weaver in the world—her fate's the proof of it. She had the bad luck to defeat the goddess Athena in a weaving contest. Athena was a sore loser, and Arachne is now a spider, creating only for Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, by special arrangement. Warp of snow and woof of flame, and never any two the same. Arachne.'"&lt;ref&gt;Beagle, Peter Soyer. The Last Unicorn. 1968. New York, Penguin Group, 1991. [Page 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marvel Comics]], Arachne is the name used by the second Spider-Woman ([[Julia Carpenter]], currently the new Madame Web) to distinguish herself from [[Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman. In Volume 3 of ''[[Monster Musume]]'', an Arachne (a human female from the hips upward and the body/legs of a spider) named Rachnera Arachnera is introduced; she goes on to become a member of the "Monster Girl" household in Volume 4. Arachne Gorgon is a powerful witch and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]''. She was responsible for crafting the first demon weapons, an act that [[Death (personification)|Death]] fiercely opposed, forcing her to bide her time and remain in hiding for 800 years. She returns to lead the risen Arachnaphobia, her personal army against Death.

The story of Arachne has also been adapted for many plays. She is the inspiration for a character featured in the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. ''Arachne: Spider Girl!'' is a play for children based on the myth by [[Ursula Dubosarsky]],  first published in the NSW [[School Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Arachne-Spider-Children-Metamorphoses-ebook/dp/B00AA7IGJU |title=Arachne: Spider Girl! (Plays for Children based on Ovid's Metamorphoses Book 8) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustave Doré]]'s illustration of Arachne's punishment in [[Purgatory]] for Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'' has had a surprising number of pop culture appearances. It is one of the many recurring images used by the rock band, [[The Mars Volta]]; it has been used in the cover of their ''[[Live (The Mars Volta EP)|Live]]'' EP, as a backdrop for their live shows, and a favorite accessory for guitarist and composer [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] in the form of a belt buckle. [[Eminem]]'s 2013 music video for the song "Rap God" features imagery from Dante's ''Purgatorio'', including the illustration of Arachne. (This is most likely a metaphor for the rappers who try to compete with the self-proclaimed "Rap God").

On Episode 245 of the Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast, Comedian Neil Campbell references Arachne and Athena's rivalry during a freestyle rap battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/earwolf/clip-scott-aukerman-amy-1|title=Clip: Scott Aukerman, Amy Poehler, Paul F.

In a short story "More Spinned Against" [[John Wyndham]] tells of how Arachne finds herself in the clutches of a spider-obsessed collector and of the deal she makes with the collector's wife Lydia.

'''''Balder Dead''''' is a [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] with powerful [[Tragedy|tragic themes]], first published in 1855 by [[Matthew Arnold]]. This poem draws upon [[Norse mythology]]: retelling the story of the murder of [[Odin]]'s son, [[Balder]], as brought about by the wicked machinations of [[Loki]], blood brother to Odin.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. Poetic Works. London: Oxford University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The evil Loki was quickly punished for murdering Balder by being exiled from [[Asgard]]. Still, it remains for the gods - the [[Æsir]] and the [[Vanir]] dwelling in Asgard - to bury and to mourn their dead.

Partly out of desperate grief - and partly in defiance of the harshness of the [[Norns]] or fates: Odin begs [[Hermóðr|Hermod]] to ride his own steed, [[Sleipnir]], down to Hell and beg [[Hel (being)|Hela]] to release Balder. Hermod executes the seemingly hopeless task: and receives from Hela the unexpected promise that she would release Balder should everything in the upper worlds mourn Balder's death. Before returning to Asgard, Hermod speaks with Balder's shade: Balder warns him that Hela's "promises" are never what they seem - and will only bear  bitter fruit. Loki himself undertakes to frustrate the Æsir's hopes: appearing as an ugly hag in Middle Earth, he refuses to mourn for Balder - thus breaking Hela's stipulated conditions.

Hermod returns to Hell to acquaint Balder with the gods' failure. Balder accepts what has happened without surprise, and they soon part: after Balder relates his vision of the end of the worlds in the approaching conflagration of [[Ragnarök]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. Poetic Works. London: Oxford University Press, 1950.  pp. 95-ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antique bessebarian romania rug .jpg|thumb|250px|An antique Bessarabian rug]]
'''Bessarabian rugs and carpets''' are the commonly given name for rugs in pile and [[tapestry]] technique originating in [[Russia]]n provinces as well as [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; Some scholars will classify [[flat-woven]] [[carpets]] as [[Bessarabia]]n, while referring to knotted-pile carpets as Ukrainian.&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;  They are predominantly from an area corresponding to modern [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; Produced under late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, they stand right on the cusp of European and Oriental carpet [[weaving]] (''see [[Turkish carpet]]'').

While most [[Persian carpet]]s can be classified to a specific region corresponding to their weave, this is not the case with Bessarabian carpets and rugs. With these rugs, the weave only gives clues about the market it was created for (rural or urban); therefore, a normal classification is disregarded and the broader term, "Bessarabian", is applied.&lt;small&gt;5 &lt;/small&gt;   

All works of the Bessarabian category are highly [[Decorative arts|decorative]]. Not dissimilar to particular [[Karabaghs]] from the [[Caucasus]], many of the designs crafted in Bessarabian carpets are floral in [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The designs usually fit within a black or brown [[Lightness (color)|tone]] background, executed in a [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] western. Some pieces, in particular the flat-weaves, are woven with the distinctive Bessarabian palette in the tradition of ''[[kilim]]'' rugs from nearby [[Anatolia]].&lt;small&gt;6&lt;/small&gt;

'''Carew Cross''' (or sometimes '''The Carew Cross''') is an 11th-century Grade I listed monument in the village of [[Carew, Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]].

==Description==
The cross is an important example of an 11th-century memorial [[Celtic cross]] and is believed to commemorate the brother of [[Hywel ab Edwin]], [[Maredudd ab Edwin]] of [[Deheubarth]], who died in 1035. The brothers were joint rulers of Deheubarth, and the cross is thought to date from around the time of Maredudd's death. It was first known to be placed in [[Carew, Pembrokeshire]], from around 1690. The previous location for the stone is unknown. It is suspected that when it was moved to Carew, it was as ornamentation for nearby [[Carew Castle]]. The damage to the cross, where part of the stone has flaked away, occurred prior to 1690.&lt;ref name=BLB&gt;{{cite web|title=The Carew Cross, Carew|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-5938-the-carew-cross-carew|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, the cross stood on a low plinth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fenton1903|Fenton (1903)]]: p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The plinth was altered around 15 years later to align it with the newly lowered road. The top stone became dislodged in 1844, and it was re-set in the slot with [[lead]]. The cross was moved away from the road in 1925, and again during the [[Second World War]], when it was relocated to the nearby castle for protection. Following the war, it was placed back by the roadside, but on at a new position.&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt;

The monument was Grade I listed on 14 May 1970; the reason description given was "Listed grade I as a characteristically Welsh composite cross and one of the finest early Christian monuments in the Principality."&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt; It was the Carew Cross that inspired the symbol of [[Cadw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carew Cross|url=http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/carewcross/?lang=en|publisher=Cadw|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is similar in design to the cross at [[Nevern]].&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt; It is inscribed, on the west face "MARGIT EUT REX ETG [uin] FILIUS" and otherwise decorated in abstract patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Park Wide - Carew Cross|url=http://www.pembrokeshirecoast.org.uk/apps/discover/detail.asp?LocID=151&amp;Lang=1&amp;A=AP|publisher=Pembrokeshire Coast National Park|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall and is in two parts, joined by a [[Mortise and tenon|tenon]] joint. The top is Carmarthenshire [[sandstone]] and the lower portion is [[igneous]]-type stone from Preseli.&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt;

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

The arms contains symbols reflecting British Columbia's British heritage along with local symbols. At the upper part of the shield is the [[Union Jack]], representing the United Kingdom. The lower portion of the shield features a golden sun setting into the ocean, representing the province's location on the Pacific.

The original arms, consisting of only the shield, were granted by [[royal warrant (document)|royal warrant]] of King [[Edward VII]] on March 31, 1906.&lt;ref name=CanHeritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/atc-ac/bc_e.cfm|title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols across Canada|author=Canada Heritage|accessdate=2 September 2008|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms were further [[Augmentation (heraldry)|augmented]] with supporters, a crest, and a compartment, by royal warrant of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on October 15, 1987.

A [[banner of arms]] comprises the [[Flag of British Columbia|provincial flag]], which was adopted in 1960.

==History==
[[File:Royalcrest lrg.jpg|thumb|left|The royal crest of British Columbia.]] The first heraldic provincial symbol was the [[Seal (emblem)|Great Seal]] of the province: the royal crest of the crowned lion upon the imperial crown, as was the usual practice for British colonies, but with the letters "BC" added. This design was created by [[Richard Clement Moody]]&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Ormsby, Richard Clement Moody, in Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldicscienceheraldique.com/arms-and-devices-of-provinces-and-territories.html|title=Heraldic Science Héraldique, Arms and Devices of Provinces and Territories, British Columbia|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was used upon British Columbia joining [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].&lt;ref name=BCProtocol /&gt;

The first coat of arms of the province was created by Canon Arthur Beanlands of Victoria, whose version was similar to the modern one: "The union device of Great Britain and Ireland: on a chief barry undée argent and azure, a setting sun in base Or."&lt;ref&gt;BC Order in Council 268/1895&lt;/ref&gt; This coat was adopted by Order-in-Council 268 July 19, 1895, as the arms and great seal of the province per the authority inferred from Section 136 of the British North America Act. Upon the order in council, the motto of the province is typeset incorrectly as {{sic|{{lang|la|Spendor Sine Occasu}}}}, which is one of several hand-made corrections and deletions upon the instrument.

While the design of the great seal was a provincial prerogative, coats of arms were (and are) honours granted by the sovereign. The province attempted to register the design with the English [[College of Arms]] in 1897, but was unable to do so for several reasons. First among them was the use of the royal crest, which is the exclusive right of the [[monarch|sovereign]] and could not be granted to another entity even as a sign of utmost loyalty to the Queen. The heralds objected to the placement of the Union Flag in an inferior position on the shield (conflicting with the popular slogan, [[The empire on which the sun never sets|"The sun never sets on the British Empire"]]). The use of supporters, a high honour, was considered presumptuous, as no other [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] had been granted such a privilege.&lt;ref name=BCProtocol /&gt;

The shield only (with the positions of the Union Flag and setting sun reversed, and with the antique crown added), along with the motto, was granted in 1906. The achievement of arms was [[Augmentation (heraldry)|augmented]] with a crest, supporters, and compartment granted by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], on 15 October 1987.&lt;ref name=BCProtocol /&gt;&lt;ref name=CanHeritage /&gt;

:The shield features a [[Union Flag]] in chief, with a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] (known heraldically as an antique crown) at its centre. In base it has the sun setting into the ocean, representing the province's location on the Pacific.
;[[Compartment (heraldry)|Compartment]]
:The compartment is a garland of Pacific Dogwood.
;[[Supporters]]
:The supporters are a [[wapiti]] (also known as [[wapiti|elk]]) stag and a [[bighorn sheep]]. The wapiti of [[Vancouver Island]] and the bighorn sheep of the mainland of the province symbolize the union of the two colonies which united to form British Columbia in 1866
;[[Motto]]
:The motto ''Splendor Sine Occasu'', is Latin and refers to the idea of ''the sun never setting over the British Empir''e.  "Occasus" (the form 'occasu' is the ablative, required after the preposition "sine") literally means a "setting" or a "going down", such as of the sun, and by extension can refer to "the west".  While one can translate the phrase to mean "splendour without diminishment", in combination with the geographical position of British Columbia (in the far west of the former British Empire), the setting sun shown on the shield, and the old concept of the sun never setting over the Empire, the motto should be understood to express the idea "a shining without a sunset".&lt;ref name=BCProtocol /&gt;

[[File:Hume titlepage1779.jpg|thumb|Title page]]
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume]]
'''''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.

In the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]—for which Hume uses a house—and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).

Hume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. The ''Dialogues'' were [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David|year=1779 |title=  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher= |place=London |edition= Second |page=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 20 June 2016}} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Pamphilus''' is a youth present during the dialogues. In a [[Letter (message)|letter]], he reconstructs the conversation of Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes in detail for his friend Hermippus. He serves as the [[narrator]] throughout the piece. At the end of the Dialogues he believes that Cleanthes offered the strongest arguments. However, this could be out of loyalty to his teacher, as this does not seem to reflect Hume's own views on the topic. When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading of this work's ending.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernd Gräfrath's "Vernunftige Gelassenheit" in G. Gabriel, C. Schildknecht, Literarische Formen der Philosophie. Metzler, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero used a similar technique in his Dialogues. 
*'''Cleanthes''' is an "experimental theist"&amp;mdash;"an exponent of orthodox empiricism"&lt;ref name="anth"&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, "A Concise Encyclopedia of the Philosophy of Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;who bases his beliefs about God's existence and nature upon a version of the [[teleological argument]], which uses evidence of design in the universe to argue for God's existence and resemblance to the human mind.
* '''Philo''', according to the predominant view among scholars, is the character who presents views most similar to those of Hume.&lt;ref&gt;William Crouch, {{cite web |url=http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |title="Which character is Hume in the "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion"?" |accessdate=2006-12-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205192218/http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |archivedate=December 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo, along with Demea, attacks Cleanthes' views on anthropomorphism and teleology; while not going as far as to deny the existence of God, Philo asserts that human reason is wholly inadequate to make any assumptions about the divine, whether through ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning or observation of nature.
* '''Demea''' "defends the [[Cosmological argument]] and philosophical theism..."&lt;ref name="anth" /&gt; He believes that the existence of God should be proven through ''a priori'' reasoning and that our beliefs about the nature of God should be based upon revelation and [[fideism]]. Demea rejects Cleanthes' "[[natural religion]]" for being too [[anthropomorphic]].  Demea objects to the abandonment of the ''a priori'' arguments by Philo and Cleanthes (both of whom are empiricists) and perceives Philo to be "accepting an extreme form of [[skepticism]]."&lt;ref name="anth"/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in popular culture}}

''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') is a fantasy [[role-playing game]] first published in 1974. As the popularity of the game grew throughout the late-1970s and 1980s, it became referenced in popular culture more frequently. The complement of games, films and cultural references based on ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s.

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', and [[tabletop role-playing games]] in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of [[video game]]s, from "[[first-person shooter]]s to [[real-time strategy]] games and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s",&lt;ref name=tychen2006/&gt; which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=rausch2004/&gt;

In online culture, the term ''dungeon'' has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, [[multi-user dungeon]]s emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of [[social network]]s or a social virtual reality.&lt;ref name="steels2004" /&gt; By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], to fully [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name="heider2009" /&gt;

[[Public figure]]s who play or have played ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' include comedians [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Chris Hardwick]], musician [[Moby]], and actors [[Vin Diesel]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name="shanafelt05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tonjes05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dnd30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oswalt07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myers04" /&gt;

==Literature==
=== Books ===
{{See also|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (novels)}}
Independent fiction derived from the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game appeared with the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series of books, published by [[TSR, Inc]] between 1982 and 1987. The ''Endless Quest'' books provided a form of [[interactive fiction]] in the style of the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series.&lt;ref name=tresca2010/&gt; The continuing success of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' then sparked an even more extensive series of novels, also published by TSR, Inc. The first of these were based upon the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' campaign setting, and were released in 1984.&lt;ref name=mackay2001/&gt; There proved to be a lucrative market for these works, and by the 2000s a significant portion of all fantasy paperbacks were being published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the American game company that acquired TSR, Inc in 1997.&lt;ref name=buker2002/&gt;

The impact of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' on players and culture has inspired reflective non-fiction works:
* ''Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks: An Epic Quest for Reality Among Role Players, Online Gamers, and Other Dwellers of Imaginary Realms'', by journalist and gamer [[Ethan Gilsdorf]]; a travel memoir about ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', role-playing games, and other fantasy and gaming subcultures.&lt;ref name=dont_escape/&gt;
* ''The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons and Growing Up Strange'', by novelist [[Mark Barrowcliffe]]; a memoir of playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and other role playing games in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=harrison20081107/&gt;
* Author [[Shelly Mazzanoble]] wrote a humorous self-help guide called ''Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: One Woman's Quest to Trade Self-help for Elf-help''. This followed her guide book, ''Confessions of a Part-time Sorceress: A Girl's Guide to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game''.&lt;ref name=wired20070926/&gt;
* ''American Nerd: The Story of My People'' is [[Time magazine]] writer [[Benjamin Nugent]]'s study of the history and culture of people labeled nerds. It includes insights into why people play and enjoy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=nugent2009/&gt;

Several characters created for playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or games derived from ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', have later spawned popular fantasy series.&lt;ref name=carlisle2009/&gt; Other novels make off-hand references to the game:

=== Comics ===
Begun in 1986, the comic books ''The Adventurers'' and ''[[Redfox (comics)|Redfox]]'' were inspired by ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=booker2010/&gt; Several commercial [[comic strip]]s are based entirely upon the game or make reference to the game in specific panels.
* ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'' is a multiple award-winning&lt;ref name=panzeri2006/&gt; comic-sized magazine featuring comic strips with a variety of characters who play "HackMaster," a parody of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. (''[[HackMaster]]'' would later go on to become an actual role-playing game.) Early strips appeared in the official ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' magazine ''[[Dragon]]''.
* The ''[[Order of the Stick]]'' is an award-winning&lt;ref name=comics_village08/&gt; satirical webcomic that features a cast of characters in a world that loosely operates by the rules of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=grossman070131/&gt;
* ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', A longstanding webcomic, created by ''[[Jerry Holkins]]'' and ''[[Mike Krahulik]]'', references and even depicts humorous instances of bizarre campaigns, and other ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' subject matter; implementing dice-rolling humor and other game dynamics.

==Visual media==
=== Film ===
{{Main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film series)}}

Several films include instances of characters playing the game of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

* In scene 2 of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[E.T. the Extra Terrestrial]]'', the character Elliott, his older brother, and his friends are shown playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=mackay01/&gt;&lt;ref name=buckland06/&gt; Prior to the production of the film, Spielberg ran a ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' session with the young cast members.&lt;ref name=ocm12_4_85/&gt;
* The ''Futurama'' film ''[[Bender's Game]]'' includes ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a crucial plot device, in which the main characters end up in a fantasy realm much like the game. The film was already in production upon Gygax's death and debuted later that year, so it was dedicated in his honor. The film included parodies of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''-influenced films.&lt;ref name=wired20081104/&gt;
* The short film ''[[Fear of Girls]]'' is a spoof of two heavy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' gamers. The filmmakers used viral marketing to attract attention to the film.&lt;ref name=lees2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=mst20070128/&gt;
* The films ''[[The Gamers (film)|The Gamers]]''&lt;ref name=nt20021203/&gt; and ''[[The Gamers: Dorkness Rising]]''&lt;ref name=jainchill2006/&gt; by the Dead Gentlemen are parodies of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

== Players ==
[[Stephen Colbert]] developed an intense interest in the game during his youth, which he later credited for his talent at character creation.&lt;ref name=carter2010/&gt; Ethan Gilsdorf credited the game for bestowing upon him "gifts of creativity and self-actualization".&lt;ref name=gilsdorf2011/&gt; Actor Vin Diesel, in his introduction to the book ''Thirty Years of Adventure'', wrote that he was "attracted to the artistic outlet the game provided" and that the game was "a training ground for our imagination and an opportunity to explore our own identities".&lt;ref name=diesel2004/&gt; Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams also participated in the 2006 [[Worldwide Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game Day]], demonstrating that the game was then still a lively and active hobby.&lt;ref name=game_day07/&gt;

Director Chris Weitz pointed out that there "are a lot of people who played and are horribly embarrassed about it and won't admit it, because it's part of their lives they put behind". He developed a fervent interest in the game, even greater than in making movies, and said the experience "had such an influence on his life".&lt;ref name=scott2005/&gt; Director Jon Favreau was drawn into the game by the fantasy elements and the sense of story, saying "it gave me a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance".&lt;ref name=favreau08/&gt;

Political reporter John J. Miller said that ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was a big part of his life during his school years, and argued that, "there's a lot to admire about ''D&amp;D'' and what it can do for kids by encouraging them to read, do math, and think creatively".&lt;ref name=miller2004/&gt; Fantasy author China Miéville said that playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a youth was one of the most enduring influences on his writing. The two things that particularly influenced him were "the mania for cataloging the fantastic" and "the weird fetish for systematization", in that everything is reduced to "game stats".&lt;ref name=gordon2003/&gt; In contrast, author Mark Barrowcliffe considers his years playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' to be a wasted youth and all of the players to be nerds. He has tried to put the experience behind him.&lt;ref name=barrowcliffe2008/&gt;

The '''national emblem of Brunei''' is featured prominently on the [[flag of Brunei]]. It was adopted in 1940. There are five main components to the national emblem (crest): the [[flag]], the royal [[parasol]] (ceremonial umbrella), the [[wing]]s, the [[hands]], and the [[crescent]].

Below the crescent is a banner; both are inscribed with yellow lettering in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]:
* On the crescent, Brunei's national motto: “Always render service with God's guidance” ({{lang|ms-Arab|الدائمون المحسنون بالهدى}}).
* On the banner (scroll), the state's name: ''{{lang|ms|Brunei Darussalam}}'' ({{lang|ms-Arab|بروني دارالسلام}}), literally “Brunei, the Abode of Peace”.

==Design==


All elements on the crest are red. On some versions they have black outlines; others have colourless outlines.

# The [[wing]]s symbolise protection of justice, tranquility, prosperity and peace.
# Below these is the [[crescent]], a symbol of [[Islam]], the state religion of [[Brunei]].
# On the sides, the upturned [[hands]] indicate the government's duty is to preserve and promote the welfare of the citizens and to protect the people.

== Personal emblem of the Sultan==
[[File:Personal Emblem of the Sultan of Brunei.svg|thumb|250px|Personal emblem of the Sultan]]

After the Constitution was enacted in 1959 the [[Sultan of Brunei]] adopted a different emblem from the emblem of state, in that the two hands were superseded by two golden ''[[sejant]]'' cats (''kuching emas''). At his coronation in 1968, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] used a crown (''mahkota'') with an original design due it is based on the brocade turbans used by previous sultans. It is made of precious metal, decorated with pendilia and a sarpech consisting of a crescent-and-ten-pointed star and topped with a seven-pointed ornament.

About 1999 a highly elaborate achievement was adopted. It maintained the inscribed crescent, since that time ''[[Vert (heraldry)|vert]]'', and the winged umbrella as core elements but the Sultan's crown was added over them. This set is surrounded by a garland of ears paddy ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]'' and  is displayed the name of God (Allah) in ''[[Chief (heraldry)|chief]]''. On the yellow standard of the Sultan, the emblem is all red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubert-herald.nl/Brunei.htm Vries, Hubert de. ''National Arms and Emblems, Past and Present. Brunei''].

      <comment>Suggestions for simplification, avoiding redundancy. Expertization is often done by individual experts, not just committees. Future tense isn't necessary when describing procedures. An "other mark" isn't really an alternative to a "mark". Cheers!</comment>

[[File:Stamp Certificate.JPG|thumb|Expertization certificate issued in 2004 for a 1915 Russian 10 [[ruble]] [[postage stamp]].]]
'''Expertization''' is the process of [[authentication]] of an object, usually of a sort that is [[collecting|collected]], by an individual [[expert|authority]] or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable [[philatelic]] items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

[[File:Flag of the State of Georgia (1956-2001).svg|thumb|The former Georgia state flag (1956-2001)]]

The city flag of [[Trenton, Georgia]], United States, was adopted in 2001 as a protest following the change of the [[Flag of Georgia (U.S. state)|state flag of Georgia]]. The flag has been [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Revival and controversy|controversial]] because it incorporates the [[Confederate Flag|Confederate Battle Flag]].

==History==

In 1956, the state of Georgia changed its flag to largely feature the Confederate battle flag as part of a protest against desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.senate.ga.gov/sro/Documents/StudyCommRpts/00StateFlag.pdf |title=The State Flag of Georgia: The 1956 Change In Its Historical Context |accessdate=2016-09-11 |last1=Azarian |first1=Alexander |first2=Eden |last2=Fesshazion |date=August 2000 |format=PDF |work=Senate Research Office |location=State of Georgia |publisher=State of Georgia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204200939/http://www.senate.ga.gov/sro/Documents/StudyCommRpts/00StateFlag.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to change the flag, relegating the location of the Confederate flag to a greatly reduced place on the state flag. The city of Trenton opposed this new flag. In the same year, the city's commissioners voted to adopt the former state flag as the city's flag as a protest, which became official in 2002.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/jun/26/confederate-banner-still-flies-trenton/311614/ |title=Confederate banner still flying high in Trenton, Ga. |publisher=Times Free Press |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Georgia had stated that it would withdraw funding for any municipality that refused to fly the new state flag and continued to fly the old one.&lt;ref name=dixie/&gt; Trenton circumvented this when they adopted the flag by altering the former state flag by adding "City of Trenton" and "Incorporated 1854" to it. It also flew the new Georgia state flag and the [[flag of the United States]] along with the city flag in keeping with the state regulations.&lt;ref name=dixie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dixieoutfitters.com/pages/blog/trenton-s-flag-loophole/ |title=Trenton’s Flag Loophole |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution (archived at Dixie Outfitters) |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change was not universally supported, and in 2004 the new mayor of Trenton, Anthony Emanuel, removed it. However following objections from the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] that the flag represented their heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dixieoutfitters.com/pages/blog/scv-tries-to-save-trenton/ |title=SCV Tries to Save Trenton |publisher=WDEF-TV News 12 (archived at Dixie Outfitters) |date=2005-01-18 |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a referendum was held in 2005. The city's residents voted 278–64 to keep the city flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =David| last =Magee | title =The South is Round| publisher =Jefferson Press |location= | volume =   | year = 2007 | isbn =0977808629 | page =83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Free to Be… You and Me''''' was a children's entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author [[Marlo Thomas]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]],&lt;ref name=NPR-MorningEdition-40th-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rachel|title=40 Years On, 'Free To Be' Still Resonates|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166735512/40-years-on-free-to-be-message-still-resonates|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]]|date=7 December 2012|format=Audio interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a [[record album]] and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as "[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends") including [[Alan Alda]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Jack Cassidy]], and [[Diana Ross]]. An ABC special, also created by [[Marlo Thomas]], using poetry, songs, and sketches followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s [[gender neutrality]], saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

== Overview ==
The original idea to create the album began with [[Marlo Thomas]],&lt;ref name=Makers-Birth-FTBYAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Marlo|title=Birth of 'Free to Be... You and Me'|url=http://www.makers.com/marlo-thomas/moments/birth-free-be%E2%80%A6-you-and-me|website=[[Makers: Women Who Make America|Makers]]|accessdate=19 October 2014|format=Video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children's books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told my sister Terre "it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it (stories featuring traditional gender roles) the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read" and she said "You go and find 'em." 

Well there weren't any. And not only weren't there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book - I'm Glad I'm a Boy! I'm Glad I'm a Girl! by [[Whitney Darrow, Jr.]]) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said "Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses." Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. 

So I said "I'll make a record for Dionne. I'll ask everybody to donate their talents and it'll be fun." [[Larry Uttal]] at [[Bell Records]] told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It's still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Produced by [[Carole Hart]], with music produced by [[Stephen J. Lawrence]] and [[Bruce Hart (songwriter)|Bruce Hart]], with stories and poems directed by [[Alan Alda]], the title has never been out of print.

Proceeds went to the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]]. The album was originally released on [[Bell Records]] in 1972 and since 1975 has been available on [[Arista Records]] cassettes and CDs. 

Well-known songs include "It's All Right to Cry," sung by football hero [[Rosey Grier]]; the title track by [[the New Seekers]]; "Helping," a Shel Silverstein poem performed by [[Tom Smothers]]; "Sisters and Brothers" by the [[Voices of East Harlem]]; and "When We Grow Up" performed by [[Diana Ross]] on the album and by [[Roberta Flack]] and a teenage [[Michael Jackson]] on the special.

Other sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include "Atalanta," co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] of [[Atalanta]]; "Boy Meets Girl" with Thomas and [[Mel Brooks]] providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by [[Wayland Flowers]], resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; "[[William's Doll]]", based on [[Charlotte Zolotow]]'s picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and "Dudley Pippin" with [[Robert Morse]] and [[Billy De Wolfe]], based on stories by Phil Ressner.

A number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although ''Housework'' was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its' description of domestic workers.

Marlo Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In among all the praise we got for the project as a whole, we kept getting all these letters and phone calls talking about the track sounding as if it wasn't normal to be fond of cooking and cleaning and caretaking etc. So we left that off the special for that reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], then editor of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' Most of the children attended Corlears School.

"[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends" followed ''Free to Be... You and Me'' with a 1988 sequel, ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]'', the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.

In her 2010 memoir, ''Growing Up Laughing'', [[Marlo Thomas]] reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Television special ==
The television special, produced by [[Marlo Thomas]] and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-[[Fred Wolf Films]], Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  It earned an 18.6 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]/27 share and went on to win an [[Emmy]]. Sixteen-mm prints of the special were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, in their school during that period.

The special appeared occasionally on [[HBO]] in the 1980s. It was released on VHS through [[Vestron Video]] subsidiary [[Children's Video Library]] in 1983.  It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land, yet has not been aired on any network since.

A [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] DVD of the television special was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.

== Criticism ==
''Free to Be'' faced backlash from some conservative religious leaders, including [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] author and psychologist [[James Dobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotskoff, Lori; Lovett, Laura (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Geomessaging''' is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/ITST.2012.6425228|title=2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications|pages=497–501|year=2012|last1=Fujioka|first1=Masanobu|last2=Takahashi|first2=Masanori|last3=Matsumura|first3=Takeshi|last4=Chunmeng Wang|last5=Hirakoba|first5=Hiroyuki|isbn=978-1-4673-3070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions can be created by using [[Geo-fence|geofences]], based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device  will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).

Rules can be: The minimum time to wait before resending a message, weekday, time range, etc.

The content of the message associated to those rules can be any images, text, html, metadata key-value pair, etc.

Increasingly geomessaging is finding its use in various applications including crisis communication and geo-location sensitive communication management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-events-venue.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Events and Venue Crisis and Incident Management |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomessage Media==
Geomessage Media defines a [[Media (communication)|media]] genre where information or messages can be sent to recipients based on their location. Platforms that enable geo-notifications to a defined [[geo-fence]] would fall into the category of Geomessage Media. A geo-fence is a virtual radius or polygon defined by longitude and latitude coordinates on a map. Geofences are being used for a vast array of applications and services like reminder applications based on area, location sharing and localized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loyola L, Wong F, Pereira D ''et al.''|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems - MobiGIS '13|pages=51–58|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534193|publisher=MobiGIS13| date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|doi=10.1145/2534190.2534193|isbn=9781450325318|chapter=Extending battery lifetime of mobile devices with geofence capabilities on dynamic-speed urban environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomessage Media is a natural progression of information sent on Mass Media and Social Media. Geomessage Media platforms allow communicating or sending a geomessage to a hyper-local area. This allows for much more relevant, geo-contextual information to be sent. In some use cases the platforms allow messaging to an anonymised group, in a defined geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shephertz.com/2016/05/05/geo-fencing-push-notifications-next-step-user-engagement |title=Geo-fencing in Push Notifications: The Next Step in User Engagement |publisher=ShepHertz |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other use cases include sending messages to a geolocation where members of a known group may enter. 

Circumstances where a Geomessage would benefit recipients are many, for example:
* Evacuations – instructions can be given to a localised area or areas to evacuate
* Transport Management - Commuters can be sent advice and information that may delay their commute
* Weather – recipients in the path of a weather event can be notified
* Place of Interest – people entering, exiting or even dwelling in a place could be sent a message.

The '''Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict''' is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses exclusively on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 133 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of the 1954 Convention were supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999. All three agreements are part of International Humanitarian Law, which, in the form of further agreements, primarily includes provisions defining the permissible means and methods of warfare and aiming at the widest possible protection of persons not involved in the fighting. In contrast to these parts of International Humanitarian Law, the agreements on the protection of cultural property were drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is primarily responsible for the dissemination and monitoring of compliance. In addition to rules designed to ensure the protection and respect of cultural property during an armed conflict, these agreements also provide for security measures to be implemented in times of peace. As of June 2018, 132 states are party to the Hague Convention of 1954, 109 and 77 states respectively have acceded to the Protocols of 1954 and 1999. Blue Shield International, based in The Hague, is active in the field of international coordination with regard to military and civil structures for the protection of cultural assets.

The guiding principles of the Convention and the motivation for its conclusion, dissemination and respect are summarised in the preamble, which states, among other things,

"... that any damage to cultural property, irrespective of the people it belongs to, is a damage to the cultural heritage    of all humanity, because every people contributes to the world's culture..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-hague-convention/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2018, 133 states are party to the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are 109 States Parties to the First Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=15391&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol has 77 States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=15207&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural property==
For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:

(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;

(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a);

(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural property]] is the manifestation and expression of the cultural heritage of a group of people or a society. It is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including the customs of a people, their practices, places, objects, artistic endeavours and values. The protection of cultural property during times of armed conflict or occupation is of great importance, because such property reflects the life, history and identity of communities; its preservation helps to rebuild communities, re-establish identities, and link people's past with their present and future.

== History ==
The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] preceded the Hague Convention of 1954.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The laws of armed conflicts : a collection of conventions, resolutions, and other documents |date=1988 |publisher=Nijhoff |last=Schindler |first=Dietrich |last2=Toman |first2=Jiří |isbn=9024733065 |edition=3rd |location=Dordrecht |oclc=13270517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multilateral agreement of 1899 and the slightly amended later version of 1907 contained in Article 27 the commandment for the attacking party to spare historical monuments, educational institutions and institutions of religious, not-for-profit, artistic or scientific significance as far as possible during sieges and bombardments. The party under attacked is called upon to ark appropriate buildings. Article 56 also contained a general ban on the confiscation, destruction or damage of such facilities. However, during the [[First World War]], acceptance of these first Hague Conventions was severely restricted by the so-called all-participation clause. It stated that, in the event of war or armed conflict, this Agreement should apply only if all States involved in that conflict are parties to the Convention.

The Russian lawyer, painter and writer [[Nicholas Roerich]], who witnessed the destruction of cultural assets in Russia during the First World War and the [[October Revolution]], initiated the development of an independent treaty at the beginning of the 1930s to protect cultural assets during armed conflicts. Ten years later, just before the beginning of the First World War, he had also addressed his idea to the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. On his initiative, Georges Chklaver of the Institute for Higher International Studies at the University of Paris drew up a corresponding draft in 1929. This proposal was subsequently discussed by the International Museum Office of the [[League of Nations]] and at private conferences in Bruges in 1931 and 1932 and in Washington, D.C. in 1933. The seventh international conference of American states, which took place in Buenos Aires in 1933, recommended the adoption of the draft. The Board of the Pan-American Union subsequently presented a treaty "on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments", which was signed on 15 April 1935 in the White House by 21 states in North, Central and South America.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; Ten of the signatory states also became parties by ratification, the first of which was the United States on 13 July 1935 and the last of which was Colombia on 20 February 1937. The agreement, also known as the [[Roerich Pact]] after its initiator, entered into force on 26 August 1935.

The Roerich Pact contained eight articles and several significant innovations compared with the general provisions of Articles 27 and 56 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. On the one hand, the treaty established the status of neutrality for historical monuments, museums, scientific and artistic institutions as well as educational and cultural institutions. This legal position, comparable to the neutrality of medical personnel and comparable institutions during a war, resulted in respect for these goods by all parties involved in a conflict and thus their protection. The Parties should send lists of monuments and sites for which they claimed protection under the Treaty to the Pan-American Union, which should forward them to all States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Roerich Pact|date=2018-05-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roerich_Pact&amp;oldid=840203974|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banner of Peace from the Roerich Pact.svg|thumb|120x120px|The Banner of Peace- The Emblem of Protection of the Roerich Pact]]
In addition, the Treaty defined a protection mark for the marking of cultural objects, consisting of three red dots in a red circle on a white background. Nicholas Roerich, who designed it with early symbolism in mind, described the significance of the three points as a symbol of art, science and religion as the three most important cultural activities of humanity, with the circle as the element that linked these three aspects in the past, present and future. The symbol was also called the "Banner of Peace", the movement based on the Roerich Pact under the name Pax Cultura in analogy to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as the "Red Cross of Culture".

However, the acceptance of the Roerich Pact was limited to the United States and the countries of Central and South America. Not a single country in Europe and Asia, the geopolitical focus of the Second World War that began a few years later, signed or ratified the treaty. Even though it remains valid in relations between the parties and the Organization of American States (OAS) and continues to act as a depositary in succession to the Pan-American Union, the Roerich Pact remained without significant practical relevance. As the USA is not party to the 1999 Second Protocol of the Hague Convention, the Roerich Pact is therefore still of importance as a contractual obligation in the area of cultural property protection. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a protective label and the administration of lists of cultural assets worthy of protection by a central international institution, this treaty introduced two important far-reaching principles in the area of the protection of cultural assets in armed conflicts that remain important today.

Only four years after the Roerich Pact was signed, the government of the Netherlands presented a draft for a new convention, in the drafting of which the International Museum Office of the League of Nations was also significantly involved. However, the start of the [[Second World War]] in the same year prevented all further steps to develop and implement this proposal. After the end of the war, in 1948 the Netherlands again submitted a proposal to UNESCO, which had been founded three years earlier. In 1951, the General Conference of UNESCO decided to set up a committee of governmental experts to draft a new convention. A year later, this committee submitted a draft to the General Conference, which forwarded it to the national governments for further discussion. From 21 April to 14 May 1954, an international conference was held in The Hague with the participation of 56 states, which drew up a final version and adopted it as the "Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; The agreement entered into force on 7 August 1956. After the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, this was the second important agreement in the field of international humanitarian law to which the United Nations played a major role in its creation and implementation.

== The Hague Convention==
The Hague Convention outlines various prohibitions and obligations which States Parties are expected to observe, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.

Broadly, the Hague Convention requires that States Parties adopt protection measures during peacetime for the safeguarding of cultural property. Such measures include the preparation of inventories, preparation for the removal of movable cultural property and the designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.

States Parties undertake to respect cultural property, not only located within their own territory, but also within the territory of other States Parties, during times of conflict and occupation. In doing so, they agree to refrain from using cultural property and its immediate surroundings for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict. States Parties also agree to refrain from any act of hostility directed against such property.

The Convention also requires the establishment of special units within national military forces, to be charged with responsibility for the protection of cultural property. Furthermore, States Parties are required to implement criminal sanctions for breaches of the Convention, and to undertake promotion of the Convention to the general public, cultural heritage professionals, the military and law-enforcement agencies.

An example of the successful implementation of the Hague Convention was the Gulf War, in which many members of the coalition forces (who were either party to the Convention or who, in the instance of the US, were not party to the Convention) accepted the Convention's rules, most notably by creating a "no-fire target list" of places where cultural property was known to exist.

===Safeguarding cultural property===
The obligation of States Parties to safeguard cultural property in peacetime is outlined in Article 3. It stipulates:

'The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict, by taking such measures, as they consider appropriate.'&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect for cultural property===
The Hague Convention sets out a minimum level of respect which all States Parties must observe, both in relation to their own national heritage as well as the heritage of other States Parties. States are obliged not to attack cultural property, nor to remove or misappropriate movable property from its territory of origin. Only exceptional cases of 'military necessity' will excuse derogation from this obligation. However, a State Party is not entitled to ignore the Convention's rules by reason of another Party's failure to implement safeguarding measures alone.

This is set out in Article 4 of the Hague Convention:

'Article 4:

(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.

(2) The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.

(3) The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.

(4) They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.

(5) No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
The rules set out in the Hague Convention also apply to States who are Occupying Powers of territory during conflict or otherwise. The Convention obliges Occupying Powers to respect the cultural property of the occupied territory, and to support local national authorities in its preservation and repair when necessary. This obligation is articulated in Article 5:

'Article 5:

(1) Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.

(2) Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.

(3) Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Special protection ===
The Hague Convention establishes a 'special protection' regime, which obliges States Parties to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection from acts of hostility (Articles 8 and 9).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Under Article 8, this protection may be granted to one of three categories of cultural property: (1) refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict; (2) centers containing monuments; and (3) other immovable cultural property of very great importance. To receive special protection, cultural property must also be located an adequate distance from an industrial center or location which would render it vulnerable to attack, and must not be used for military purposes.

== First Protocol to the Hague Convention ==
The First Protocol was adopted at the same time as the Hague Convention, on 14 May 1954. It specifically applies to movable cultural property only, and prohibits the export of movable property from occupied territory and also requires its return to its original territory at the conclusion of hostilities (Article 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15391&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; States Parties under the obligation to prevent the export of such property may be required to pay an indemnity to States whose property was removed during hostilities.

==Second Protocol to the Hague Convention==
{{anchor|Second Protocol to the Hague Convention}}
Criminal acts committed against cultural property in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s highlighted the deficiencies in the implementation of the Hague Convention and its First Protocol. As a result of the 'Boylan review' (a review of the Convention led by Professor Patrick Boylan),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001001/100159eo.pdf|title=Review of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict|last=Boylan|first=Patrick J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference held at The Hague in March 1999. The Second Protocol seeks complement and expand upon the provisions of the Hague Convention, by including developments in international humanitarian law and cultural property protection which had emerged since 1954. It builds on the provisions contained in the Convention relating to the safeguarding of and respect for cultural property, as well as the conduct of hostilities; thereby providing greater protection for cultural property than that conferred by the Hague Convention and its First Protocol.

===Enhanced protection===
[[File:Azerbaijan Gobustan site - EP sign.jpg|thumb|The enhanced protection emblem displayed at the Gobustan Archaeological site in Azerbaijan.]]
One of the most important features of the Second Protocol is the 'enhanced protection' regime it establishes. This new category of cultural property is outlined in Chapter Three of the Second Protocol. Enhanced protection status means that the relevant cultural property must remain immune from military attack, once it is inscribed on the List of Cultural Property Under Enhanced Protection.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/enhanced-protection/|title=Enhanced Protection {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1954 Hague Convention requires States not to make any cultural property the object of attack except for cases of 'military necessity', the Second Protocol stipulates that cultural property under enhanced protection must not be made a military target, even if it has (by its use) become a 'military objective'. An attack against cultural property which enjoys enhanced protection status is only excusable if such an attack is the 'only feasible means of terminating the use of property [in that way]' (Article 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be granted enhanced protection, the cultural property in question must satisfy the three criteria stipulated in Article 10 of the Second Protocol. The three conditions are:

(a) it  is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;

(b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection; and

(c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are 13 cultural properties from 8 States Parties inscribed on the Enhanced Protection List. These include sites in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cambodia, Cyprus, Georgia, Italy, Lithuania, and Mali.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

===The Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 24 of the Second Protocol establishes a 12-member Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its members are elected for a term of four years, and an equitable geographic representation is taken into account at the election of its members. The Committee meets once a year in ordinary session, and in extraordinary sessions if and when it deems necessary.

The Committee is responsible for the granting, suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection to cultural properties nominated by States Parties. It also receives and considers requests for international assistance which are submitted by States, as well as determining the use of the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Under Article 27 of the Second Protocol, the Committee also has a mandate to develop Guidelines for the implementation of the Second Protocol.

===The Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 29 of the Second Protocol establishes the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its purpose is to provide financial or other assistance for 'preparatory or other measures to be taken in peacetime'. It also provides financial or other assistance in relation to 'emergency, provisional or other measures to protect cultural property during periods of armed conflict', or for recovery at the end of hostilities. The Fund consists of voluntary contributions from States Parties to the Second Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/fund/|title=Fund {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the sums of US $50,000 and US $40,000 were provided to Libya and Mali respectively from the Fund, in response to their requests for assistance in the installation of emergency and safeguarding measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/international-assistance/|title=International Assistance {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions and individual criminal responsibility===
Chapter Four of the Second Protocol specifies sanctions to be imposed for serious violations against cultural property, and defines the conditions in which individual criminal responsibility should apply. This reflects an increased effort to fight impunity through effective criminal prosecution since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1954. The Second Protocol defines five 'serious violations' for which it establishes individual criminal responsibility (Article 15):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack; 
# using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action; 
# extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol; 
# making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object of attack; and
# theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural property protected under the Convention.
States are obligated to adopt appropriate legislation to make these violations criminal offences under their domestic legislation, to stipulate appropriate penalties for these offences, and to establish jurisdiction over these offences (including universal jurisdiction for three of the five serious violations, as set out in Article 16(1)(c)).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of prosecution for crimes against cultural property is ''The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi'' case, handed down by the International Criminal Court on 27 September 2016. Al Mahdi was charged with and pleaded guilty to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Case Information Sheet: The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi|last=International Criminal Court|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803043957/https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Mahdi was a member of the Ansar Eddine group (a group associated with Al Qaeda), and a co-perpetrator of damaging and destroying nine mausoleums and one mosque in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Military Manual ===
[[File:Military manual.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Military Manual on the Protection of Cultural Property]]
In 2016 UNESCO, in collaboration with the Sanremo International Institute of Humanitarian Law, published a manual titled 'Protection of Cultural Property: Military Manual'. This manual outlines the rules and obligations contained in the Second Protocol, and provides practical guidance on how these rules should be implemented by military forces around the world. It also contains suggestions as to best military practices in relation to these obligations. It relates only to the international laws governing armed conflict, and does not discuss military assistance that is provided in connection with other circumstances such as natural disasters.

==Destruction of cultural property in World War II==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===The Nazis and "degenerate art"===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Le Canot, En Canot, Femme au Canot et a l'Ombrelle, Im Boot, approximate dimensions 150 x 116.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''[[En Canot|En Canot (Im Boot)]]'' was one of many works classified as [[degenerate art]] and confiscated by the Nazis.]]The Nazi Party headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in Germany in 1933 after the country's crippling defeat, and its socioeconomic distress during the years following [[World War I]]. [[World War II]] was aimed at reclaiming the glory of the once great Germanic state. Cultural property of many European nations and significant ethnic and social groups within them fell victim to Nazi Germany. The Nazi party, through the [[Third Reich]], confiscated close to 20% of all Western European art during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/records-and-research/documenting-nazi-plunder-of-european-art.html|title=Documenting Nazi Plunder of European Art|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Nazi party had looted and collected thousands of objects, art works and artefacts from occupied nations, destroyed many, or stored them in secret.

With artists depicting the hardship of the German people after World War I, and further expressing the fear of anti-Semitism and fascism, the Nazi party and Hitler himself soon realised the dangerous power of art, and began to clamp down on artistic production and forcing both artists and the public alike to adhere to a Nazi-approved style.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter-Müri|first=Simone|date=2004|title=Teaching about War and Political Art in the New Millennium|jstor=3194079|journal=Art Education|volume=57|issue=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent within the Nazi's ideology was the idea of supremacy of the [[Aryan race|Aryan Race]] and all that it produced; as such the Nazi campaign's aims were to neutralize non-Germanic cultures and this was done through the destruction of culturally significant art and artefacts. This is illustrated greatest in the Jewish communities throughout Europe; by devising a series of laws that allowed them to justify and regulate the legal confiscation of cultural and personal property. Within Germany the looting of German Jewish cultural property began with the confiscation of non-Germanic artwork in the German state collection. Further, artists that were Jewish and artworks that did not match the Nazi ideology, or posed a threat to it, were stamped as [[degenerate art]]. Degenerate works of art, culminating in the infamous exhibition with the same name, were those whose subject, artist, or art was either Jewish or expressed Anti-Nazi sentiments, and was as such offensive to the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, Bücherverbrennung.jpg|default px|thumbnail|right|[[Nazi book burnings]].]]

Jewish collections were looted the most throughout the war. German Jews were ordered to report their personal assets, which were then privatized by the country. Jewish owned art galleries were forced to sell the works of art they housed. The Nazis concentrated their efforts on ensuring that all art within Germany would be Aryan in nature, speaking to the might of the Germanic state rather than Jewish art which was deemed as a blight on society. In a feat to "purge" German museums and collections, confiscation committees seized approximately 16,000 items within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|title=Degenerate art - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unexploited art was destroyed in massive bonfires. As the war progressed, the Nazi party elite ordered the confiscation of cultural property throughout various European countries.

===Nazi plunder in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Amber Room-1.jpg|thumbnail|Modern Day Amber Room]]
In the [[Soviet Union]], Nazi plunder of cultural significant art is best illustrated in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich's]] pillage of the [[Catherine Palace]] near [[St Petersburg]] and its famous [[Amber Room]] dating to the early 1700s. In October 1941, the Nazis had occupied the western portion of the Soviet Union, and began removing art treasures to the west. The entirety of the [[Amber Room]] was removed to [[Königsberg]] and reconstructed there. In January 1945, with the Russian army advancing on the city, the Amber Room was ordered to be moved again but its fate is thereafter unclear. A post-war Russian report concluded that 'summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945' during the battle to take the city. However, in the absence of definitive proof, other theories about its fate continue to be entertained to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-amber-room-160940121/|title=A Brief History of the Amber Room|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With financial assistance from German donors, Russian craftsmen reconstructed a new Amber Room during the 1990s. The new room was dedicated by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.

==After World War II==
With the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the subsequent defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the atrocities which the Nazi leadership condoned, leading to the removal of culturally significant items and the destruction of numerous others could not be allowed to occur in future generations. This led the victorious [[Allied forces (World War II)|Allied forces]] to create provisions to ensure safeguards for culturally significant items in times of war. As a result, following the signature of the [[Roerich Pact]] by the American States in 1935, attempts were undertaken to draft a more comprehensive convention for the protection of monuments and works of art in time of war. In 1939, a draft convention, elaborated under the auspices of the International Museums Office, was presented to governments by the Netherlands. Due to the onset of the Second World War the draft convention was shelved with no further steps being taken. With the conclusion of the war, a new proposal was submitted to [[UNESCO]] by the Netherlands in 1948. The General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1951 decided to convene a committee of government experts to draft a convention. This committee met in 1952 and thereafter submitted its drafts to the General Conference. The intergovernmental Conference, which drew up and adopted the Convention and the further Acts, took place at The Hague from 21 April to 14 May 1954 where 56 States were represented. Following this international agreement The Hague Convention For the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict would come into force in 1956 in order to be an instrument of non derogation for the states bound by the document to stop the looting and destruction of cultural property.

==Implementation of the Convention==

=== Punishment for infringements ===
The [[Rome Statute]], adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, as the legal basis of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), defines in Article 8(2) deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments as [[war crimes]] in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - By topic|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Court is thus authorised to prosecute such crimes if such an act was committed either by a national of a Contracting Party or on the territory of a Contracting Party. However, it only exercises its competence if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to ensure effective prosecution itself. Since September 2015, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has been charged with the destruction of mausoleums in Timbuktu in the first trial before the ICC over the destruction of cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Situation in the Republic of Mali, The Prosecutor v.

From the time of its establishment the city of Dubrovnik was under the protection of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; after the Fourth Crusade the city came under the sovereignty of Venice 1205–1358 CE, and by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358, it became part of the Hungarian-Croatian Kingdom. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the city was annexed by Austria and remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the conclusion of the First World War. From 1918 to 1939 Dubrovnik was part of the Zetska Banovina District that established its Croatian connections. From 1945 to 1990 Croatia would become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One of the most striking features of the historic city of Dubrovnik, and that which gives its characteristic appearance are its intact medieval fortifications. Its historic city walls run uninterrupted encircling the Old-City. This complex structure of fortification is one of the most complete depictions of medieval construction in the Mediterranean, consisting of a series of forts, bastions, casemates, towers and detached forts. Within the Old City are many medieval churches, cathedrals, and palaces from the Baroque period, encircled by its fortified wall, which would ensure its listed place by [[UNESCO]] as a world heritage site in 1972. The Old Town is not only an architectural and urban ensemble of high quality, but it is also full of museums and libraries, such as the collection of the Ragusan masters in the Dominican Monastery, the Museum of the History of Dubrovnik, the Icon Museum, and the libraries of the Franciscan and Dominican Monasteries. It also houses the archives of [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], which have been kept continuously since the 13th century and are a very important source for Mediterranean history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95|title=Old City of Dubrovnik|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives hold materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa.

The Siege of Dubrovnik was a military engagement fought between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and Croatian forces which defended the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The Old Town was specifically targeted by the JNA even though it served no military purpose to bomb this town. At the heart of the bombing efforts by the JNA elite was the complete eradication of the memory of the Croatian people and history by erasing their cultural heritage and destroying their cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/strugar/cis/en/cis_strugar_en.pdf|title=ICTY Information Sheet on Dubrovnik Case and Strugar|last=|first=|date=|website=ICTY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's convictions, which among other charges were also based on this article, were issued in February 2001 against Dario Kordić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/kordic_cerkez/4|title=Kordić &amp; Čerkez (IT-95-14/2) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia, against Miodrag Jokić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/miodrag_jokic/4|title=Jokić, Miodrag (IT-01-42/1) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior commander in the navy of the Yugoslav People's Army during the Battle of Dubrovnik in 1991, and against Milan Martić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/martic/4|title=Martić (IT-95-11) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a politician and military leader of the internationally unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al. (IT-04-74) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the fire on the bridge.

The historic town of [[Mostar]], spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as an Ottoman frontier town and during the [[Austro-Hungarian]] period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar was mostly known for its old Turkish houses and specifically the [[Old Bridge, Mostar|Old Bridge]]; the Stari Mostar, after which it is named. In the 1990s conflict with the former Yugoslavia, however, most of the historic town and the Old Bridge were destroyed purposely by Croatian Army and their allies. This type of destruction was in step with that of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, where the aim was the eradication of the memory of the people that once occupied the land, an effort reminiscent of the [[Third Reich]] and the Nazi party. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the firing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al.

=== Khmer Rouge Tribunal ===
The [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal]], established by the United Nations together with the government of Cambodia in July 2006, has the possibility of prosecuting the destruction of cultural assets during the [[Khmer Rouge]] dictatorship from April 1975 to January 1979, with explicit reference to the Hague Convention of 1954, pursuant to Article 7 of the Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Law on the establishment of extraordinary Chambers

https://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/legal-documents/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, most of the more than 3,300 temples and 130 mosques in Cambodia were severely damaged by the Khmer Rouge. They also destroyed all 73 Catholic churches and many other sites of religious or cultural significance. The Hague Convention of 1954 can be applied in principle, since Cambodia became a party to the Convention in 1962, before the Khmer Rouge came to power, and because Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that even in non-international armed conflicts, each party to the conflict is bound at least by the provisions on respect for cultural property.

However, it is not yet known whether and to what extent trials will be instituted in the court which are based on the destruction of cultural property. A possible problem with the application of Article 7 and thus with the Hague Convention, is that it is a legal requirement to establish the existence of an armed conflict. This would then resemble the definition commonly used in international humanitarian law. Whether such an assessment of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship will be possible, cannot yet be predicted.

===Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL===
{{main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]].  The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL has plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIL attack|author=Khalid al-Taie|publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com|date=13 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIL activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

Although Libya, Syria and Iraq ratified the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1957, 1958 and 1967 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention. The Hague|date=14 May 1954|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not been effectively enforced.

== International Acceptance and Partnering Organisations ==
As of June 2018, 131 states have become party to the Hague Convention of 1954 and 109 states to the first protocol. 77 states have become party to the Second Protocol of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/states-parties/|title=States Parties {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], France became a party in 1957. Russia is contracting party in legal succession of the Soviet Union, which also became party in 1957. the People's Republic of China ratified the convention in 2000 and the United States acceded in 2009. The United Kingdom signed the Agreement in 1954 and ratified the Convention and acceded to the Protocols in 2017.

The main reason for the long period between signature and ratification by the United States were the reservations of the [[US Department of Defense]] during the [[Cold War]], that the Convention's obligations regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons could not be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usicomos.org/hague-convention-and-usicomos/|title=Hague Convention and US/ICOMOS|website=www.usicomos.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff, to which the commanders-in-chief of all units of the American armed forces belong, unanimously declared itself in 1995 in favour of voluntary compliance with the Convention. On 6 January 1999, then US President Bill Clinton recommended that the US Senate ratify both agreements. In his opinion, they were not only in accordance with the principles and methods of the American Armed Forces, but were even based on them in essential aspects. After the Senate approved accession in September 2008, the US Ambassador to UNESCO, Stephen Engelken, handed over the instrument of ratification to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], Secretary-General of UNESCO on 13 March 2009. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on 14 May 2004, the Government of the United Kingdom declared its intention to become a party to the Convention and the two Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20121223133857/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2452.aspx|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK To Ratify Convention Safeguarding Cultural Heri…|date=2012-12-23|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the conclusion of the Second Protocol of 1999, which, in the view of the British government, eliminated essential weaknesses and ambiguities of the 1954 Convention. A draft law containing ratification of the Convention, the two protocols and criminal law provisions was announced by the UK government in November 2006.

=== UNESCO ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), a legally independent specialized agency of the United Nations based in Paris, and is the most important international institution in the field of dissemination and implementation of the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. It acts as depositary of the Hague Convention of 1954 and its two Protocols and administers the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection".

=== Blue Shield International ===
In addition, Blue Shield International (formerly the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]], ICBS; in French Comité International du Bouclier Bleu, CIBB) has existed since 1996. Its mission is to improve international cooperation in the field of cultural heritage protection and to support local and regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53136889|title=A Blue shield for the protection of our endangered cultural heritage : proceedings of the open session co-organized by PAC core activity and the section on national libraries|date=2003|publisher=International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, Core Acitivity on Preservation and Conservation|others=Koch, Corine., IFLA Programme on Preservation and Conservations.|isbn=2912743028|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=53136889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1999-second-protocol/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the International Committee was founded in 2017, national Blue Shield Committees have already been established in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Curacao, Denmark, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Madagascar, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and the USA, comparable to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. These national associations support the work of the International Committee in their respective home countries. The Association of the National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) was established on September 28, 2006 as its umbrella organization. Since 2017, all international activities have been bundled in Blue Shield International.

While in many wars the freedom of movement of United Nations personnel is significantly restricted due to security concerns, Blue Shield is regarded as particularly suitable due to its structure to act flexibly and autonomously in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gezielte Zerstörung von (Welt- )Kulturerbe in Krisenländern als Herausforderung für die Vereinten Nationen |author=Sabine Freifrau von Schorlemer |publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Co. KG.|isbn=9783848727872 |edition=1st |location=Baden-Baden |oclc=934159492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the partial dissolution of state structures and the very unclear security situation resulting from the wars and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali, Egypt and Libya, the employees of Blue Shield and its national organizations then carried out very robust undertakings to protect the cultural assets there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/23_1/feature.html|title=Newsletter 23.1 Spring 2008|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concerns in particular the collection of cultural assets to be protected, the compilation with local experts of "no-strike lists" (- which preserve the coordinates of important cultural monuments), the linking of civil and military structures and the training of local military personnel with regard to the protection of cultural assets. From Blue Shield's point of view, it is not enough to develop and adopt international law norms such as the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict or the Doha Statement of the Conference of 'Ulamâ on Islam and Cultural Heritage'. It is necessary to implement these standards effectively on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000012502400/Bildersturm-in-MossulKlassische-Normen-und-Uebereinkuenfte-versagen|title=Bildersturm: Die globalen Normen zum Schutz von Kulturgut greifen nicht - derStandard.at|website=DER STANDARD|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also concerns the prevention of the illicit trade in antiquities and stolen cultural assets to finance military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/05/real-life-indiana-jones-vs-isis|title=Real-Life Indiana Jones Vs.

=== Other civil society structures ===
The "International League of National Societies for the Protection of Cultural Property", based in the Swiss city of Freiburg, was also established in May 1997 as an international umbrella organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dgks-ev.org/internationale-liga/|title=Internationale Liga – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturgüterschutz e.V.|website=dgks-ev.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the activities of these national and international organisations and associations, which also include the protection of cultural property against disasters in times of peace, [[civil society]] structures will play an increasing role in the field of cultural property protection and support the work of state and international institutions.

One example of international cooperation in the protection of cultural assets was the temporary storage of art treasures from the National Museum in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in Switzerland. The art objects, which were severely threatened in the National Museum both by the [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)]] that lasted until 1995 and by the subsequent rule of the [[Taliban]] regime, were moved to a so-called "Afghanistan Museum in Exile" in the Swiss town of Bubendorf in 1999 with the consent of all parties to the conflict. The exhibition, which was supported primarily by the voluntary work of Swiss citizens and exiled Afghans, as well as by donations of around 1.5 million Swiss francs and supervised by the Swiss Afghanistan Institute based in Bubendorf, was open to the public from October 2000 to October 2006 and was visited by around 50,000 people during this time. In March 2007, the objects were returned to Kabul under the direction of UNESCO and with the support of the German Air Force. According to the spokesman of the Bubendorf Museum, this was the largest return of art objects since the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phototheca-afghanica.ch/afghanistanmuseum/|title=Internet - The Afghanistan Museum in Exile|website=www.phototheca-afghanica.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in [[Baghdad]] was seriously plundered from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the [[Iraq War]]. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, some nine years after its closure as a result of the war. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents.[1] According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also indicated that some of the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000 to 15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.

People often see '''hidden faces''' in things.  Depending on the circumstances, this is referred to as [[pareidolia]], the perception or recognition of a specific pattern or form in something essentially different.  It is thus also a kind of [[optical illusion]].  When an artist notices that two different things have a similar appearance, and draws or paints a picture making this similarity evident he makes images with double meanings. Many of these images are hidden faces or hidden skulls.

These illusionistic pictures present the viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: head or landscape, head or objects, head or architecture, etc. Both of them are valid, but the viewer sees only one of them and very often he cannot see both interpretations simultaneously.

There are everyday examples of hidden faces, they are "chance images" including faces in the clouds, figures of the [[Rorschach Test]] and the [[Man in the Moon]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote about them in his notebook: "If you look at walls that are stained or made of different kinds of stones you can think you see in them certain picturesque views of mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, broad valleys, and hills of different shapes. You can also find in them battles and rapidly moving figures, strange faces and costumes, as well as an infinite number of things." [[Francois and Jean Robert]] collected and published a lot of photos of "chance faces".{{clear}}

The Mannerist master at the 16th-century imperial Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] of [[Milan]] was probably the best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces.  He arranged flowers, vegetables, fruits, shells, scallops and other animals, books and different things on the canvas in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a portrait. His series of The Four Seasons seems to be the first use of this approach and technique. Arcimboldo's composite heads were celebrated and imitated by his contemporaries but they were relatively forgotten until participants in the twentieth-century art movements rediscovered them, bringing them to the attention of art historians. He is considered as forerunner of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Some other famous [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] artists created hidden faces:{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]
*[[Albrecht Dürer]]
*[[Tobias Stimmer]]
*[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]
*[[Matthäus Merian]]
*[[Anna Maria Sibylla Merian]]
*[[Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder]]
*[[Wenzel Hollar]]
*[[Josse de Momper]]

[[Salvador Dalí]] was fascinated by the technique of Arcimboldo and his paranoia-critical method was influenced by the [[Mannerist]] painter. For Dalí the Arcimboldo effect was form of self concealment as well as this exhibitionist painter seemed, all throughout his life of constant posturing, to hide his [[real self]] behind the gaudy externals of his behaviour. Larvatus prodeo, "I wear a mask," he could have said with Descartes and he used this quotation from the French philosopher for the epigraph of his novel ''Hidden Faces''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Probably his most famous "hidden face" is [[Voltaire]] in his oil painting: "Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire".
Other [[Surrealist]] painters rediscovered the technique of hidden faces in the first part of 20th century: 
*[[Max Ernst]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[René Magritte]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Istvan Orosz]] tries to combine the technique of [[anamorphosis]] with the hidden faces. 
Anamorphosis is used for those works of art that were made as distorted and unrecognizable through clever geometrical constructions. But when viewed from a certain point, or through a reflecting object placed upon it, the hidden image appears in its true shape, that is, it goes through retransformation. 
Orosz made experiments with anamorphoses not only in resurrecting the old technique but to improve and develop it. Instead of having a meaningless distorted image, his intent is to bring sense to the basic anamorphic picture, giving it meaning in itself with its second reading being revealed by viewing it from a different viewpoint such as looking at it through a special mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: landscape and portrait of Jules Verne in the mirror cylinder |publisher=gallery-diabolus.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070312/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ambiguous layers coming up by this approach make use of the connection or contrast of the two images within the same picture being independent from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeareszinhaz.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: a theatre and portrait of William Shakespeare.

There are many other contemporary works using hidden faces:

'''Jazz piano''' is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing [[jazz]]. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities. For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement, regardless of their main instrument. (By extension the phrase 'jazz piano' can refer to similar techniques on any keyboard instrument.)

Along with the [[jazz guitar|guitar]], [[vibraphone]], and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and [[chord (music)|chord]]s rather than only single notes as does the [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]].

==Beginning==
A new style known as “stride” or “Harlem stride” emerged during the 1920s, predominantly in New York. [[James P. Johnson]] was a prominent adherent. The left hand was used to establish rhythm while the right hand improvised melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jazz Piano Roots: A Short History of Early Jazz Piano - Part I|last=Lees|first=Gene|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=Katonah, NY|pages=Pg. 24|quote=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
===Learning jazz piano===

[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Bill Evans]] performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival.]]
Mastering the various chord voicings—simple to advanced—is the first building block of learning jazz piano.  Jazz piano technique uses all the chords found in Western art music, such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, seventh, diminished seventh, sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, suspended fourth, and so on.  A second key skill is learning to play with a [[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] rhythm and "feel". In jazz, the roots are usually omitted from keyboard voicings, as this task is left to the [[double bass]] player. Jazz pianists also make extensive use of chord "extensions", such as adding the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth scale degree to the chord. In some cases, these extensions may be "altered" i.e. sharpened or flattened, as in the case of a "sharp 11" chord.

The next step is learning to improvise melodic lines using scales and chord tones. This ability is perfected after long experience, including much practice, which internalizes the physical skills of playing and the technical elements of harmony, and it requires a great natural 'ear' for extemporaneous music-making. When jazz pianists [[improvisation|improvise]], they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz piano. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised "by ear" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play "by ear." Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and guitar players, bebop-era jazz pianists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.&lt;ref&gt;''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08678-6}}. Page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles===
Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One may play the bass register in an [[ostinato]] pattern, popular in  [[boogie-woogie]] style, where the left hand repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song, as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp." The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline that emulates the walking of an [[upright bass]]. In [[stride piano]], (similar to the earlier [[ragtime]]) the left hand rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the bass register and chords in the tenor register, while the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed in George Gershwin's "Liza".  The right hand may play melodic lines, or harmonic content, chordally or in octaves. It may also be played in lockstep with the left hand, using a double melody [[block chord]] called "locked-hand" [[voicing (music)|voicing]], or [[Shearing voicing]]—a technique popularized, though not invented, by the pianist and set leader [[George Shearing]].

===Ensemble role===
[[File:ODJBcard.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, with Henry Ragas on piano.]]
Jazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz.  Early on, black jazz musicians created [[ragtime]] on the piano.  As the genre progressed the piano was usually featured in the rhythm section of a band, which was typically configured as one or more of piano, guitar, bass, or drums, or other instruments, such as the vibraphone.

Over time, playing piano-accompaniment in ensemble sets, and then bands, changed from primarily time-keeping (consisting of repetitive left-hand figures) to a more flexible role. Ultimately, the skilled pianist was free both to lead and to answer the instrumental soloist, using both short and sustained, chordal and melodic, fragments—a technique known as '[[comping]]'. Good comping musicians were capable of many and different chord voicings, so to match the various moods the different soloists were aiming for. In the early days not all leading pianists were concerned to provide comping. Others—notably [[Duke Ellington]], who became famous during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] at the [[Cotton Club]]—earned great esteem among band members as well as other musicians. Ellington comped enthusiastically in support of the soloist and did much to develop the technique.

Jazz piano moved away from playing lead melody to providing foundation for song sets; soon, skilled jazz pianists were performing as soloists. In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of great piano players emerged. Pianists like [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Bud Powell]] helped create and establish the sound of [[bebop]]. [[Bill Evans]] built upon the style of Bud Powell while adding a distinct classical influence to his playing while [[Oscar Peterson]] pushed rhythmic variations and was influenced by the style of [[Art Tatum]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Nat King Cole]]. [[Wynton Kelly]], [[Red Garland]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Keith Jarrett]] were also exceptional pianists who played with [[Miles Davis]].  [[Tommy Flanagan]] was featured by [[John Coltrane]] on his hit album ''[[Giant Steps]]''. [[McCoy Tyner]] is also an influential player who played with Coltrane.

'''''Jet Pilot''''' is a 1962 [[pop art]] work done in [[pencil|graphite pencil]] by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Like many of Lichtenstein's works from this time period, it was inspired by a comic book image, but he made notable modifications of the source in his work.

== Background ==

[[File:Jet Pilot source.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The source of ''Jet Pilot'' was All American Men of War #89 (l), January–February 1962, National Periodical Publications (DC)]]

In the mid-1970s the work was owned by Richard Brown Baker, who had acquired the work in May 1963.&lt;ref name="Stebbins 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldrich 1965"/&gt;
As of 2013 it is owned by the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], which also hosts the related work ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]''.&lt;ref name="LFO Museums"/&gt;

Lichtenstein was a trained [[United States Army]] pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a [[World War II]] (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat.&lt;ref name="LFO Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarthy 2004"/&gt;
His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has produced several works featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as ''Jet Pilot'' (1962), ''[[Brattata]]'' (1962), ''[[Bratatat!]]'' (1963), and ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
''Jet Pilot'' is one of several drawings that Lichtenstein has done in a [[Frottage (art)|frottage]] technique, in a time before he routinely used the [[Ben-Day dots]] for which he is better known.&lt;ref name="Wood 1988"/&gt; This work has been on a worldwide tour of Lichtenstein's 1961&amp;ndash;68 black-and-white sketches, accompanied by [[DC Comics]] artwork.&lt;ref name="Vogel 2010-07-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolnick 2010-09-29"/&gt;

The source of ''Jet Pilot'' was ''All American Men of War'' #89 (January–February 1962, [[DC Comics]]).&lt;ref name="ID 3163"/&gt; ''Jet Pilot'' is one of several comics-based works, including ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'' and ''Von Karp'', inspired by the [[World War II]] [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[U.S. Air Force]] fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]''.&lt;ref name="YaleUP 2012-06-26"/&gt;  The same ''All American Men of War'' issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', ''[[Brattata]]'', ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]'', ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

Lichtenstein usually simplified from his source material, but in ''Jet Pilot'' the [[gun sight]] is more detailed than in the source.&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002"/&gt; In Lichtenstein's image the line of enemy bullets follows a different path, thereby reducing the suspense caused in the source as the bullets ruptured the pilot's [[air hose]].&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002"/&gt; The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of "machine and embodied vision" as exhibited in works such as ''[[Crak!]]'', ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', and ''Bratatat!''.&lt;ref name=RLGB&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|date=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|pages=118&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Klazomenian sarcophagus Antikensammlung Berlin 30030 10.jpg|thumb|Detail of the headpiece, with a homoerotic scene involving aristocratic youths.]]
'''Klazomenian Sarcophagi''' (also '''Clazomenian Sarcophagi''' or '''Klazomenai Sarcophagi''') are a type of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[sarcophagus]] named after the [[Ionia|Ionian Greek]] city of [[Klazomenai]], where most examples were found. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a rectangular broad frame, often covered with a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]]  and then painted.

The second major site for these sarcophagi is [[Smyrna]]. A few others have been found in [[Rhodes]], [[Samos]], [[Lesbos]] and [[Ephesos]]. They were probably produced in Klazomenai, between 550 BC (Late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]]) and 470 BC (Early [[Classical Greece|Classical]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Schraudolph, EOS 4/1998, p. 8 dates them 550-470; Thomas Mannack, ''Griechische Vasenmalerei'', p. 135, 530 to 470/460 BC. Boardman teilt, ''Early Greek Vase Painting'', p. 149, has similar dates (''begins around 530 and lasts to the 470s'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture and use==
The large clay sarcophagi were manufactured and fired as a single piece. The workshops were probably near the cemeteries. It is assumed that the firing kilns were built over the unfired sarcophagi.

Due to the relatively complex and time-consuming method of manufacture, it is unlikely that the sarcophagi were only ordered after the death of their intended occupants. Instead, they were either acquired already during their lifetimes, or simply produced in such amounts as to have stocks available when needed. The sarcophagi, with their weight of about 350&amp;nbsp;kg, then had to be transported only a short distance to the grave. The deceased was carried to the cemetery in a procession and then placed in his or her sarcophagus, which had already been inserted into the ground up to the height of its rim. For this reason, only the top parts of the sarcophagi bear decoration (if any). It was then closed with a stone slab. After the funerary rites, a mound of sand was placed on top.

[[Image:Klazomenai sarcophagus in the Antikensammlung Berlin 01.jpg|thumb|left|Klazomenai sarcophagus in the [[Pergamonmuseum]].]]
The workshops that produced such objects were probably mainly specialised in making clay decorative elements for architecture.&lt;ref name="Schraudolph"&gt;Schraudolph, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decoration==
During the first two decades, sarcophagi were only decorated with ornamentation. Then, figural depictions were added to the head and foot ends. The headpieces, which were higher, often received scenes of combat, hunting and athletic contests, executed in the [[black-figure vase painting|black-figure technique]]. Details were not incised but added in white paint. Usually only shade-like traces of such internal detail survive. The images are mostly concerned with aspects of life that would be relevant to the local aristocracy.   Only a small proportion was executed in the [[red-figure vase painting|red-figure technique]]. The head end often bore scenes of animal fights in silhouette technique.&lt;ref name="Schraudolph" /&gt; They were influenced by the late animal frieze style. The sides often bear ornaments such as [[palmette]]s and rope patterns. One of the earliest recognised painters is the [[Borelli Painter]], others include the [[Albertinum Painter]] and the (late) [[Hopkinson Painter]].

Today, museum exhibits normally display only the frames of the sarcophagi. The basins were often smashed after discovery, as only the painted parts were considered of interest, and transport would be facilitated by reducing the object's weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="242084">A '''[[New Testament minuscule]]''' is a copy of a portion of the [[New Testament]] written in a small, cursive Greek script (developed from [[Uncial script|Uncial]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minuscules 1001-1500==
* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Caspar René Gregory]], often referred to as the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbers.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 100 year increment where specific date is unknown.
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s, The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline epistles]], and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="powderblue"|Light blue color indicates manuscript not imaged, and is currently lost or ownership unknown.
|-
|bgcolor="mistyrose"|Light pink color indicates manuscript destroyed, presumed destroyed, or deemed too fragile to digitize.
|-
|bgcolor="violet"|Violet color indicates high resolution ultraviolet images available online.
|}
&lt;br&gt;
† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates only a portion of the books were included. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates lost portions of manuscript replaced via supplement of a later hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;abs&lt;/sup&gt; (''abschrift'') Indicates manuscript is copy. All of these have now received new numbers from the INTF.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was formerly numbered as a copy of another manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, was found to be written in modern Greek versus Koine Greek, or has been destroyed.&lt;br&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
!#!!Date!!Contents!!Pages!!Institution!!City, State!!Country!!Images&lt;ref&gt;The two primary collections of manuscript images include the CSNTM ( {{cite web|url=http://www.csntm.org/Manuscript | title=Manuscript Search|publisher=Center for the Student of New Testament Manuscripts |accessdate=2016-08-26}}) and the INTF ( {{cite web|url=http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/manuscript-workspace/| title=Manuscript Workspace|publisher=''Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung''|accessdate=2016-08-26}}) Other hosted images are referenced separately.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madonna of the Rose Bower''''' (or '''''Virgin in the Rose Bower''''') is a panel painting by the German artist [[Stefan Lochner]], usually dated c 1440-42, although some art historians believe it contemporaneous with his later ''[[Dombild Altarpiece]]''. It is usually seen as one of his finest and most closely detailed works.&lt;ref name="c274"&gt;Chapuis, 274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin]] is presented as "[[Queen of Heaven]]", and is seated under a canopy with red curtains held apart by angels. She sits on a red cut velvet [[bolster]], holding the Christ child in her lap.&lt;ref name="c88"&gt;Chapuis, 88&lt;/ref&gt; Her crown and medallion are symbols of her virginity.&lt;ref name="w8"&gt;Wellesz, 8&lt;/ref&gt; She wears a minutely detailed [[brooch]], which contains a representation of a seated maiden holding a [[unicorn]].&lt;ref name="c89"&gt;Chapuis, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ holds an apple, while hovering and seated angels offer gifts or play music. Five kneel in the grass before her, with instruments including a portable organ, others bear fruit.

The painting is heavily infused with symbols of innocence and purity, including the red and white roses.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wallraf.museum/en/collections/middle-ages/masterpieces/stefan-lochner-madonna-of-the-rose-bower/the-highlight/ Madonna of the Rose Bower, c. 1440 – 1442]". [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]]. Retrieved 26 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Mary sits before a curved stone bench, around which grow lilies, daisies and strawberries, with an [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] flower blooming to her left. Mary herself is presented on a monumental scale, underscoring her regal status.&lt;ref name="c88" /&gt;

==Early life==
Moore was born Suzanne Alberte Malherbe in [[Nantes]], France on 19 July 1892,&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Louise|date=|year=2005|title=Sans Nom: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=https://www.jerseyheritage.org/media/PDF-Heritage-Mag/Sans%20Nom%20Claude%20Cahun%20%20Marcel%20Moore.pdf|journal=Heritage Magazine|volume=2005|pages=8–9|via=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied at the Fine Arts Academy in Nantes.  In 1909, at age seventeen, Malherbe met fifteen-year-old Lucie Schwob and began a lifelong artistic collaboration.&lt;ref name="Acting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Latimer|first=Tirza True|title=Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Tirza/TirzaEssay1.html|website=QueerCulturalCenter.org|publisher=Queer Cultural Center|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malherbe's widowed mother married Schwob's divorced father in 1917.  Curator Tirza True Latimer has theorized that this step-sister relationship not only encouraged the young ladies' creative collaborations but also diverted attention from their lesbian relationship.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  Between 1920 and 1937, they lived in Paris, where they became involved with the [[surrealism]] movement and contributed to avant-garde theater activities.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villareal, ed.|first=Jose|title=Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=http://artdaily.com/news/15056/Acting-Out--Claude-Cahun-and-Marcel-Moore#.VPtJaMYhw-8|website=ArtDaily.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They took gender-neutral [[pseudonym]]s: Malherbe became Marcel Moore, and Schwob became [[Claude Cahun]].&lt;ref name="Odysseys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon-Godeau|first=Abigail|editor1-last=Rice|editor1-first=Shelley|title=Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0262681064|pages=116|chapter=The Equivocal "I": Claude Cahun as Lesbian Subject}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cahun described Moore as "''l'autre moi''" (the other me), and they remained together until Cahun's death in 1954.&lt;ref name="Odysseys" /&gt;

==Career==
In her early twenties Moore worked as a graphic designer, producing ornate illustrations influenced by the [[japonism]] trend and the Paris fashion scene of the 1910s.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; Her modern fashion designs were published in the newspaper ''Phare de la Loire'', owned by the Schwob family.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  She also collaborated with the poet [[Marc-Adolphe Guégan]], producing illustrations for two of his books: ''L'Invitation à la fête primitive'' (1921) and ''Oya-Insula ou l'Enfant à la conque'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illustration by Marcel Moore for Oya-Insula ou l'Enfant à la Conque by Marc-Adolphe Guégan|url=http://www.connectotel.com/cahun/guegan-moore.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Moore is best known as Claude Cahun's collaborator. Cahun's photographic oeuvre, all but forgotten for a few decades, was rediscovered in the 1980s and interpreted as a predecessor of [[Cindy Sherman]]'s theatrical self-portraits.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|title=Mirror Images: Women, Surrealism, and Self-Representation|year=1998|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0262531577|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent scholarship suggests that Moore was not only a muse but also had an active hand in the creation of some of Cahun's best-known works.  In an essay for the 2005–2006 exhibition ''Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore'' at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, curator Tirza True Latimer argues that Claude Cahun's own photographs are not so much "self-portraits" as collaborations with Marcel Moore.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  At times, the women photographed each other posing alternately in the same tableau.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  Moore's shadow is visible in some photographs of Cahun, making visible her own role behind the camera.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;

Moore illustrated Cahun's creative writing on several occasions.  For Cahun's 1919 poetry volume ''Vues et visions'', Moore created pen-and-ink illustrations similar to the decorative style of Aubrey Beardsley.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book|last=Latimer|first=Tirza True|title=Women Together/Women Apart: Portraits of Lesbian Paris|year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=0-8135-3594-8|pages=76–80, 137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore was the subject of Cahun's dedication, "I dedicate this puerile prose to you, so that the entire book will belong to you and in this way your designs may redeem my text in our eyes."&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt; In 1930 Cahun and Moore published a second book of verses and illustrations called ''Aveux non avenus'' (translated as "disavowed confessions").  Moore's illustrations for this work consist of collaged images assembled from her many photographs of Cahun, dealing with many of the same themes of identity that are can be read in Cahun's own photography and poetry.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;

==Activism==
In 1937 Moore and Cahun moved from Paris to [[Jersey]], possibly to escape the increasing [[anti-Semitism]] and political upheavals leading up to World War II.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  They remained on the island of Jersey when German troops invaded in 1940.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  For several years, the two women risked their lives by distributing anti-Nazi propaganda to the German soldiers.&lt;ref name="Nazi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Katherine|title=Claude Cahun as Anti-Nazi Resistance Fighter|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/exhibits/odysseys/Nazi/body_nazi.html|website=NYU.edu|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite having reverted to their original names and introducing themselves as sisters in Jersey, their resistance activities were discovered in 1944, and the women were sentenced to death and imprisoned.  They were saved by the Liberation of Jersey in 1945, but their home and property had been confiscated and much of their art destroyed by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;

==Later life==
Claude Cahun's health suffered during her wartime imprisonment; she died in 1954, after which Moore relocated to a smaller home.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt;  Moore committed suicide in 1972.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; She was buried with her partner Claude Cahun in [[St Brelade's Church]].

==Legacy==
In 2018, a street of Paris, close to the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Suzanne and Lucie lived, took the name of "Allée Claude Cahun - Marcel Moore&lt;ref&gt; [http://a06.apps.paris.fr/a06/jsp/site/plugins/solr/modules/ods/DoDownload.jsp?id_document=144541&amp;items_per_page=20&amp;sort_name=&amp;sort_order=&amp;terms=cahun&amp;query=cahun Conseil de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;" in the 6th district of the French capital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">'''Olivier Auber''' (born 1960) is a French independent artist and researcher. He is best known for his project "[[Poietic Generator]]" and for having introduced the concept of "Digital Perspective" in the fields of network theory, art and [[digital humanities]].

==Biography==
Olivier Auber was born in 1960 in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.

He holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the [[Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers]]. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics ([[head-up display]]). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now [[Thales Group]]) and at [[CERN]] in Geneva.

In 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], the [[Palais de la Découverte]]. The creation for the "Expressions et behaviours" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.

End of 1987, while working with [[Tod Machover]] (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of [[Philip K. Dick]], he designed what would become his best known work, the "[[Poietic Generator]]", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the "France-Japan Monument" on [[Awaji Island]] in the Bay of [[Kobe]], launched under the aegis of [[François Mitterrand]]. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (exhibition "Communication et Monumentalité", 1989), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (exhibition "Machines à communiquer", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including [http://www.arslab.it ARSLAB] in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize "art and science" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition "ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality", sponsored by the City of [[Turin]] - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani &lt;ref name= catalogue1&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtual'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue2&gt;1998, ''Arslab. I labirinti del corpo in gioco.'' published by hopefulmonster, Turin, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue3&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtuality'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now [[Télécom ParisTech]]) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet ([[Mbone]]) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.

In 1996, he developed a version of [[Poietic Generator]] for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.

In 1997 he co-founded the [http://km2.net/ A+H Culture Laboratory], with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the [[:de:Nibelungenmuseum Worms|Nibelungen Museum]] in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation "The treasure of the Nibelungs", inspired by the [[Poietic Generator]], was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.

In 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navidis.com/ Navidis, innovative solutions to the Smart Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.

In 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&amp;D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.

In 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair&lt;ref&gt;[http://imaginaires.telecom-paristech.fr/ Research Chair "modeling imaginary"]&lt;/ref&gt; at Telecom ParisTech devoted to "modeling imaginary" with the help of [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[Ubisoft]], Orange Lab, [[Peugeot-Citroen]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Datar]] and [[Minatec]].

Since 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the [[Poietic Generator]]. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecco.vub.ac.be/ Research group on "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition (ECCO)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Brain Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Francis Heylighen]], and as an active member of the [[P2P Foundation]].

==Theoretical arguments==

From 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the [[Poietic Generator]] as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the "temporal perspective" and the "digital perspective", on which he wrote several papers&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, oline on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt; whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006.

The '''portrayal of women scientists in film''' refers to the way that professional women in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)]] fields are written as film characters. The portrayal of women is a hotly contested talking point in the film community, with feminists saying that women are not accurately depicted in films. Judith Mayne, author and professor of women's studies at [[Ohio State University]], claims that the study of female characters in film began with movements from the 1960s and 1970s in the form of [[second-wave feminism]], the rise of [[independent film]]s, and the beginning of academic [[film studies]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Mayne, Judith. “Feminist Film Theory and Criticism.” ''Signs'', vol. 11, no. 1, 1985, pp. 81–100. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3174288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars offer several different stereotypes that academic women fall under in films. Eva Flicker, professor of sociology specializing in film at the [[University of Vienna]], is a leading scholar on the topic of academic women in film, specifically women in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/personnel/members-of-staff/test/eva-flicker-research-uni-wien/|title=Department of Sociology » Eva Flicker Research Uni Wien|website=www.soz.univie.ac.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flicker writes that the role of women scientists often reflect that "job stereotypes are combined with gender stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hüppauf, Bernd-Rüdiger, and Peter Weingart, editors. ''Science Images and Popular Images of the Sciences''. vol. 8, Routledge, 2008, books.google.com/books?id=BE1j7Hs5egcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe that objectification is reserved solely for female characters in films. [[Noël Carroll|Nöel Carroll]], professor of philosophy at [[Cornell University]], writes that men are also strategically blocked for the audience's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Carroll does not disagree with the notion that women are objectified in film; rather, his stance says that women are not the only ones affected by the erotic gaze of viewers.

== History of Women Scientists in Film ==
'''Gorillas in the Mist (1988)'''

The film [[Gorillas in the Mist]] based on the book by [[Dian Fossey]] appears to show respect for the fact that a [[woman]] would rather work on her career than be a stereotypical housewife.  The story is about the scientist Fossey that leaves the United States to study gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. As she bonds with the gorillas, she worries about poachers and devotes her time to protecting the animals. Fossey is shown as an independent woman, breaking the common trope of women being the homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Film Theory|last=Thornham|first=Sue|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780814782446|location=New York|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jurassic Park (1993)'''

The 1993 film [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], based on the novel by [[Michael Crichton]] depicts a [[paleobotanist]], Dr. Ellie Sattler. She is portrayed with great physical ability, allowing her to survive multiple attacks from dinosaurs. She is shown to have extensive knowledge about dinosaurs and plant life throughout the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurassic Park|last=Crichton|first=Michael|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1990|isbn=0345370775|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravity (2013)'''''

The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], is often heralded as a breakthrough feminist film due to Bullock's starring role. Some who have critiqued the film have written that ''Gravity'' "proves that a woman can anchor an action-packed blockbuster that does ''not'' have to include violence, superheroes, weapons and/or huge death tolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/22/the-feminist-pull-of-gravity/|title=The Feminist Pull of "Gravity" - Ms. Magazine Blog|date=2013-10-22|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's lead is a woman, she gets by with help from her male counterpart, played by Clooney. Bullock's character Ryan Stone is described as "the very model of the damsel in distress," as she can never get out of a situation on her own and must lean on Clooney's character to do the heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/gravity-my-most-overrated-film|title=Gravity: my most overrated film|last=Evans|first=Alan|date=2014-11-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Bullock's character is thought to be an act of defiant feminism, as she is the lead in a science fiction film, but below the surface viewers find that the film actually subscribes to traditional gender stereotypes and does not at all portray Bullock's character as a true independent woman.

== Ways of Analyzing Women in Film ==
In terms of intelligence, women are not often portrayed as equal to men. Eva Flicker writes that in science fiction films, men are overwhelmingly portrayed as scientists, making up 82% of all film scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Flicker, Eva. “Between Brains and Breasts—Women Scientists in Fiction Film: On the Marginalization and Sexualization of Scientific Competence.” ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2003, pp. 307–318., doi:10.1177/0963662503123009.&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing 60 movies, Flicker has placed the women shown in science fiction films into six categories.

=== "The Old Maid" ===
This type of woman scientist is "only interested in her work"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and is often depicted having a nondescript appearance and style. As the film progresses, a man saves her and brings out her feminine side, after which she becomes more attractive. However, she loses credibility as an academic and suddenly makes more mistakes than when she did not focus as much on her appearance. Based on this type of story, Flicker concludes that "femininity and intelligence are mutually exclusive characteristics in a woman's film role."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example of this woman in a film can be seen in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|,]] in the character Dr. Constance Peterson.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Male Woman" ===
This type of woman works with men in an all male environment. Because of this, she has a "harsh voice" and occasionally "succumbs to an unhealthy lifestyle," such as partaking in smoking and drinking, to fit in with the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Flicker claims that this type of woman is "lost somewhere in the middle" of masculinity and femininity, meaning she is not as sexual a character as other women are, but she is also not on the same level as the men she works with. This decreases her credibility both as a women and as one trying to fit into "a man's world." In the end, her heightened female emotions allow her to contribute to a solution, which is her redeeming quality as a character.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "male woman" character appears in the 1970 [[science fiction]] film ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Naïve Expert" ===
Seen in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', this woman scientist does very little. For the sake of the dramatization of the film, she is crucial, but she does not advance the story and does not contribute much to the solution. Instead, her femininity causes more trouble for the team of scientists. She is young, attractive, and subject to experience womanly emotions which add an extra layer to the existing predicament, forcing the man to solve the problem in order to get the team out of trouble. She is "naïve in her actions," messing up every task that is given to her despite her extensive education and knowledge, while her male counterpart stands in stark contrast and ends up saving the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Evil Plotter" ===
[[File:Alison Doody 2.jpg|thumb|Alison Doody, who played [[Indiana Jones]]'s attractive female counterpart Dr. Elsa Schneider in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''|259x259px]]
The "evil plotter" woman is young and very beautiful, and she uses her feminine charm to trick the men into doing what she wants. She has an ulterior motive, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from what the rest of the team is trying to accomplish. She is the character that the audience and the other characters despise by the end of the movie because she is devilishly smart and knows how to use her scientific knowledge and sexual prowess for evil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This bombshell character type was portrayed by [[Alison Doody]] as [[Dr. Elsa Schneider]] in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Daughter/Assistant" ===
This role of female scientist encompasses many feminine stereotypes portrayed in movies. In this role the woman is subordinate to her male counterpart, who is either her father or her lover. She is smart and capable, but her secondary role does not allow her to demonstrate her abilities. Flicker writes that when this woman plays the role of lover to the male scientist, "her work place is limited to the bed."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She is only good for sexual satisfaction, not for the degree she earned. The assistant role is seen in the female Dr. Medford in the film [[Them! (1954 film)|''Them!'']], as she is portrayed alongside an older gentleman of the same name.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Lonely Heroine" ===

This type of woman scientist is intelligent, attractive, and somewhat independent. Flicker says that she "has appropriated some male traits," such as losing herself in her work. She is both sexual and smart, and she manages to exhibit both qualities in the film. Despite this, she is still subordinate to the men on her team, and depends on them and their work in order to gain respect. She is the most progressive of the woman scientist types, but she lacks her own form of independence and still must rely on a sexual relationship with a man in order to be seen as someone.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "lonely heroine" type is best seen in [[Jodie Foster|Jodie Foster']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s portrayal of Elleonore Arroway in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:SDCC13 - Gravity panel (9345233475) cropped.png|thumb|Sandra Bullock (center), with director Alfonso Cuarón (right), and producer [[David Heyman]]|195x195px]]

== Female Characters as Objects in Film ==
Flicker argues that women are often pigeonholed into these six limiting roles when written in films. Each of these roles places the female scientist character on the sidelines, and does not allow her to be on the same level as her male counterpart(s). Despite the fact that the women in these roles are educated, and often just as educated as the men on their team, they are used primarily as assistants and sexual characters. Producers strategically write women's roles for the male gaze, often making the female characters use their "weapons of a woman," such as sex appeal, to be attractive to male characters and viewers alike.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
[[File:Laura Mulvey Fot Mariusz Kubik July 24 2010 03.JPG|thumb|Prominent feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey|227x227px]]
Feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] writes that in film, women are passive objects of the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mulvey, Laura. “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” Film Theory and Criticism : Introductory Readings. Eds. Leo Braudy and Marshall Cohen. New York: Oxford UP, 1999: 833-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey writes that movies fulfill "a primordial wish for pleasurable looking," and that male audiences are largely catered to in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In her analysis of film, she states that the lead woman in a film often falls in love with her male counterpart, and when she does, she only exists as a character to please him. Through the male character's ownership of the woman, the men in the audience find themselves owning her as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Male gaze is a big factor to consider when looking at female scientists and how they are portrayed in films. Typically women are viewed as sexual objects for pleasure of males who view these films. This has a direct effect on how people interpret women scientists and their role in movies. Instead of being portrayed as superheroes, they begin to obtain a reputation based on sexual appeal.

Considering superhero films, Amy Shackelford mentions how the [[male gaze]] is applied to hypersexualize the female character, further misinterpreting women in the media through visual depiction. Looking at these particular films, screenwriters have a difficult time accomplishing the task of writing female characters. Shackelford also states that it seems like the only way these screenwriters know how to portray female characters in superhero films power is to hypersexualize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/female-characters-superhero-films/|title=The Grim Reality of Female Characters in Superhero Films|last=Shackelford|first=Amy|date=November 30, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Mayne supports Laura Mulvey's view. She writes that "most feminist film theory and criticism of the last decade" has been in written in response to Mulvey's 1975 assessment, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues that understanding the often sexist portrayal of women in film requires "an understanding of patriarchy as oppressive and as vulnerable."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mayne goes deeper in her argument claiming that feminist film theory inspired feminist documentaries that are "aimed at rejecting stereotyped images of women."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This criticism also opens the question about "the notion of woman as 'image.'"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Law professor Sarah Eschholz and her colleagues Jana Bufkin and Jenny Long write that in film, women are often young, and female characters are rarely played by middle aged or older women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Eschholz, Sarah, et al. “Symbolic Reality Bites: Women And Racial/Ethnic Minorities In Modern Film.” ''Sociological Spectrum'', vol. 22, no. 3, 2002, pp. 299–334., doi:10.1080/02732170290062658.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only role available to these women is that of the mother, who is not meant to be a leading character. They write that "females' primary societal value is based on physical appearance and youthful beauty."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to their assessment, men are valued at all ages, and arguably more so as they age and become wiser. Most women in film are 35 years old or younger, while their male costars are often older.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite women in film having impressive credentials and extensive educations, they are often reduced to objects for looking, due to a reluctance to hire an older, less attractive woman for a major role.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the traditional husband and wife family, women are often portrayed as the second in command. Their husbands take on the role of family head and get to maintain a bachelor level of freedom, which allows them to work and spend time out with the guys. Eschholz, Bufkin, and Long report on studies that show female characters are more likely to be married and have a family than male characters.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Men have the freedom to work and be protagonists through their actions, while their wives or girlfriends are forced to take a back seat in the story in order to care for the family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Opposing Views ==
Nöel Carroll references Mulvey's pivotal paper on psychoanalysis and visual pleasure in his writing, and plays devil's advocate to her claim that women are the only subjects of gaze. Carroll acknowledges and agrees with Mulvey's assessment that women in film are strategically placed for the male gaze despite the role of their actual character. Carroll states, "Women in Hollywood film are staged and blocked for the purpose of male erotic contemplation and pleasure."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Carroll, Noël. “The Image of Women in Film: A Defense of a Paradigm.” ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 48, no. 4, 1990, pp. 349–360. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/431572.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carroll adds that men in films are also strategically placed for the purpose of pleasure. He cites such examples as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], big bodybuilding actors "whose scenes are blocked and staged precisely to afford spectacles of bulging pectorals and other parts."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly to actresses, male actors are also heralded for their facial attractiveness and are sometimes lauded exclusively for being attractive. As an example, Carroll brings in [[Leslie Howard]], an actor in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]],'' who was highly successful in the industry despite being "staggeringly ineffectual."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to Carroll, being subject to the erotic gaze of the audience is not an exclusively female burden; rather, both sexes fall prey to Hollywood camera angles that best show off their bodies.

[[Kristin Thompson]], an American film theorist, analyzes the film ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]].'' In her analysis, she claims that the main character, Laura, was written to embody the role of "passive visual object," which Mulvey and Flicker claim is an extremely prevalent role of women in film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Thompson, like Carroll, does not believe that this passive role is limited to women in the industry. Thompson claims that Mulvey's assessment stating that women are used as objects and men cannot handle being the subject of gaze is  "common but not universal" in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17326947|title=Breaking the glass armor : neoformalist film analysis|last=1950-|first=Thompson, Kristin,|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691067244|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=17326947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that men are also presented in flashy ways in film, and gives the example of [[Howard Keel]] in the film ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her analysis aligns with Carroll's conclusion that both sexes must be the subject of the audience's gaze, and that objectification is all-encompassing.

== Impact of Film Portrayals of Women ==
[[File:Female scientist from DAST.png|thumb|Female scientist drawn in a Draw-a-Scientist Test (Chambers, 1983)]]
Studies have shown that female scientists are either underrepresented or misrepresented as film characters.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As Eva Flicker writes, film has a way of taking social realities and expressing women in [[:Category:Media formats|media formats]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The media formats then are able to influence the audience by creating a mirror of metaphors, myths, opinions and a social memory resulting in stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ways that women scientists are portrayed in films have contributed to viewers holding certain stereotypes of scientists. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by Jocelyn Steinke of [[Western Michigan University]] and colleagues looked at gender stereotyping by children who have been exposed to images of scientists through films, television shows, and books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Steinke, Jocelyn, et al. “Assessing Media Influences on Middle School-Aged Children's Perceptions of Women in Science Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST).” ''Science Communication'', vol. 29, no. 1, 2007, pp. 35–64., doi:10.1177/1075547007306508.&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported on consisted of elementary school students taking the [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|Draw-a-Scientist-Test]], or [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|DAST]]. The results showed that out of the over 4,000 children who participated in the DAST, only 28 girls drew female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another study of 1,137 Korean students between the ages of eleven and fifteen found that 74 percent of them drew male scientists, while only 16 percent had depicted female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study includes the result that gender stereotypes can be the product of the environment a person possess and can influence how a person views themselves and others around them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As social media platforms are being used more and more each day by [[adolescence]]s, the reinforcement of cultural norms is at an all time high.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinke|first=Jocelyn|date=September 2005|title=Cultural Representations of Gender and Science- Portrayals of Female Scientists and Engineers in Popular Films|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1075547005278610|journal=DOI: 10.1177/1075547005278610|volume= 27|pages=27–63|via=Science Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before young women reach adolescence, social media platforms transform their images of women into the different stereotypes of dependent, emotional and less capable beings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Post-surrealism''' is a movement that arose in [[Southern California]] in 1934 when [[Helen Lundeberg]] and [[Lorser Feitelson]] wrote a manifesto explaining their desire to use art to convey the relationship between the perceptual and the conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Sometimes this term is used to refer to [[art movements|art movement]] related to or influenced by [[surrealism]], which occurred after a so-called period of "historical surrealism".  Some have claimed that the term is unnecessary, because surrealism continues to the present day {{Who|date=January 2010}}.

Modern-day surrealist activity is sometimes called "post surrealism" by advocates of the idea that surrealism is "dead".

==History==
Both Lundeberg and Feitelman participated in a showing of art for the [[Los Angeles Art Association]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in 1954. Along with Stephen Longstreet and [[Elise Cavanna]], the artists whose paintings were presented were known collectively as ''Functionists West''. Feitelson and Cavanna showed only non-objective works. Both artists employed flat-colored and near geometrical shapes.

Post-Surrealism was an American spin on the European-born art movement of the 20th Century. Beginning in the 1930s, artists searched for a style that would differentiate themselves from the dreamlike surrealism of Europe and more sub-conscious, earlier movements of Romanticism and Modernism. This new form of "Americana Dream" art began in Los Angeles, California. The cities' fanciful, other-worldly architecture and extravagant city-scape provided ample inspiration for burgeoning artists. Other cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Dallas became hotbeds for these creators.

While exhibiting in California in 1934, Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundberg displayed their work under the name post-surrealism. For the first time, artists were able to separate themselves through their own name, and even formed a Surrealism group which boasted such great artists as Philip Guston, Reuben Kadish, Knud Merrild, and [[Grace Clements (artist)|Grace Clements]].

As a social movement as well as art, the works being created at this time reflected the prevalent issues throughout the country. Undoubtedly, the war was a major factor in the surrealism movement. Although the works which focused on these events were surrealist, they are now classified as Social-surrealism. Dalí influenced many social surrealists, including O. Louis Guglielmi, James Guy, Walter Quirt and David Smith, whose techniques can be seen in all of the aforementioned artists' works.

(2009) [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/9/18 The three main monotheistic religions and gm food technology: an overview of perspectives.] BMC Int Health Hum Rights. 2009 Aug 22;9:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

One perspective emphasizes that humanity was created in God's image and this means that humanity can "partner with God in the perfection of everything in the world," and therefore Jewish law accepts genetic engineering to save and prolong human life as well as increase the quality or quantity of the world's food supply.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

Other perspectives hold that GM food technology is a violation of [[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|Kil'ayim]], the mixed breeding of crops or livestock, and that because God made "distinctions in the natural world", Jews must honor them.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

From the perspective of kosher laws, food made with genes from pigs or other non-kosher animals would likely be nonkosher.&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Druker, Executive Director, Alliance for Bio-Integrity (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130514014950/http://www.biointegrity.org/Halakha.html Are Genetically Engineered Foods in Accord with Jewish Law?] Published on Ag Biotech InfoNet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Islam too forbids eating of pork, and Islamic scholars have also raised concern about the theoretical production of foods with genes from pigs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yahyayunus.net/2.html Islam and GMOs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430161013/http://www.yahyayunus.net/2.html |date=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And there are varying perspectives.   A seminar of Islamic scholars in Kuwait on genetics and genetic engineering in October 1998 concluded that although there are fears about the possibility of the harmful effects of GM food technology and GM food products on human beings and the environment, there are no laws within Islam which stop the genetic modification of food crops and animals.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;   And in 2003, the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) approved the importation and consumption of genetically modified food products by Indonesian Muslims.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;  Others have written that while there are Quranic verses forbidding humanity from defacing God's creation, these "cannot be invoked as a total and radical ban on genetic engineering ... If carried too far, it would conflict with many forms of curative surgery that also entail some change in God's creation".&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

Voices in opposition to GMOs argue, based on the Quran,   that there is no need for genetic modification of food crops because God created everything perfectly and man does not have any right to manipulate anything that God has created nor to tamper with it.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt;

==Christianity==

===Roman Catholic Church===

Views of Rome on genetic engineering
In 1999, after two years of discussions,  the Vatican's [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] stated that modifying the genes of plants and animals is theologically acceptable.  The Guardian reported that "Bishop Elio Sgreccia, vice- president of the pontifical academy, said: 'We are increasingly encouraged that the advantages of genetic engineering of plants and animals are greater than the risks. The risks should be carefully followed through openness, analysis and controls, but without a sense of alarm.'   Referring to genetically modified products such as corn and soya, Sgreccia added: 'We give it a prudent 'yes' We cannot agree with the position of some groups that say it is against the will of God to meddle with the genetic make-up of plants and animals.'"&lt;ref&gt;Antony Barnett for the Guardian. November 27, 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/nov/28/food.gm GM food: special report.  Vatican theologians say 'prudent yes' to GM foods]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Prakash for AgBioWorld. June 15, 2001. [http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/catholic.html The Catholic Church is Not against the Use of Biotechnology in Agriculture But Simply Advocates Prudence and Regulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 as part of the [[Great Jubilee]] Pope [[John Paul II]] gave an address concerning agriculture, at which he said: The "famous words of Genesis entrust the earth to man's use, not abuse. They do not make man the absolute arbiter of the earth's governance, but the Creator's "co-worker":  a stupendous mission, but one which is also marked by precise boundaries that can never be transgressed with impunity. This is a principle to be remembered in agricultural production itself, whenever there is a question of its advance through the application of biotechnologies, which cannot be evaluated solely on the basis of immediate economic interests. They must be submitted beforehand to rigorous scientific and ethical examination, to prevent them from becoming disastrous for human health and the future of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;John Pail II. 11 November 2000  [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20001111_jubilagric_en.html Address to the Jubilee of the Agricultural World.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lyman (2000) [http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/GEessays/PopeGMO.htm Pope Expresses Opposition to GMOs, Cites Need for 'the Respect of Nature']  Daily Report for Executives 221:A-6.

====Other studies and statements====
A 2002 meeting between bishops and scientists in the Philippines concluded that biotechnology could be an important stepping stone in the struggle against hunger and environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/zenit.html Biotechnology seen as a key help for developing countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 symposium gathered by Cardinal [[Renato T. Martino]] has examined the use of GMOs in modern agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-8652?l=english Symposium Looking at Genetically Modified Organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627041843/http://www.zenit.org/article-8652?l=english |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symposium's study  argued that the future of humanity is at stake and that there is no room for the ideological arguments advanced by environmentalists.&lt;ref name="Vatican says GM food is a Blessing"&gt;[http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/blessing.html Vatican says GM food is a Blessing]&lt;/ref&gt;
Velasio De Paolis, a professor of canon law at the Pontifical Urban University, has said that it was "easy to say no to GM food if your stomach is full".&lt;ref name="Vatican says GM food is a Blessing"/&gt;

In 2008, Fr. Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban priest and "well-known commentator on environmental issues", questioned whether  hosts from [[transgenic wheat]] could ever be approved by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] because of the Church's strict rules regarding [[sacramental bread]]. He specifically cited canon 924, which stipulates the bread must be wheaten only, and recently made, so that there is no danger of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Reilly for Independent.ie August 24, 2008 [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/eucharist-from-gm-wheat-contravenes-canon-law-1462177.html Eucharist from GM wheat 'contravenes canon law']&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study on genetically modified organisms sponsored by the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] came to a favorable conclusion on GMOs, viewing them as praiseworthy for improving the lives of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/ecology/vatican-study-endorses-gmos-food-security Vatican study endorses GMOs for food security]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====

The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, and official pronouncements of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) exert a strong influence in policy making and the CBCP has not supported biotechnology, and probably will not until there is an official endorsement from the Pope.&lt;ref name=Cabanilla&gt;Liborio S.

On the basis of that meeting, she issued a statement indicating that she felt it was important that opponents of GMOs knew that according to the Vatican, GMOs are not immoral.&lt;ref name=Cabanilla /&gt;  The CBCP issued a statement in response stating that the Pope had not endorsed GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

'''Rose Kerr''' (born February 1953) is an English art historian specializing in [[Chinese art]], especially [[Chinese ceramics]], on which she has written a number of books. She was the Keeper of the Far Eastern Department at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London until 2003. In 2015, she was made an honorary citizen of Jingdezhen, China, the historic centre of Chinese porcelain production, in recognition of her academic research on Jingdezhen ceramics, and her promotion of [[cultural exchange]] between the United Kingdom and China. She was the first non-Chinese citizen to be so honoured.

==Early life==
Rose Kerr was born in February 1953. She graduated in Chinese studies from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London,&lt;ref name=gbcc/&gt; and was one of a handful of British students to live and study in China during the last year of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1975-1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hand grenade practice in Peking: my part in the Cultural Revolution|last=Wood|first=Frances.|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0719557811|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzchinasociety.org.nz/28234/nelson-branch-newsletter-no-10-november-2016/ November meeting ~ ~ The Cultural Revolution through English eyes ~ Friday 25 November, 5:30 p.m.] Nelson Branch Newsletter No. 10 – November 2016, New Zealand China Friendship Society. Retrieved 9 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kerr was Keeper of the Far Eastern Department at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalasiaticsociety.org/dr-rose-kerr-on-zhenwu-the-dark-warrior-daoist-beliefs-and-imagery-in-china/ Dr Rose Kerr on Zhenwu, the Dark Warrior: Daoist beliefs and imagery in China.] Ed Weech, Royal Asiatic Society, 29 September 2016. Retrieved 9 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; until her retirement in 2003.&lt;ref name=gbcc/&gt;

Her work with professor [[Nigel Wood]], ''Science and Civilisation in China Vol. 5 Part 12: Ceramic Technology'' ( {{ISBN|0521838339}}) is a major contribution to the seminal series of works on Chinese science begun by [[Joseph Needham]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The volume on Ceramic Technology is a work of almost one thousand pages. It synthesises information derived from historic texts, archaeological excavation and the principles of ceramic science.It covers the formation of clays and their relation to the underlying geologies of China, firing, manufacturing methods and sequences, glazes, pigments and gilding, and the impact of Chinese ceramic technology around the world from the 7th century onwards. The volume was unique in its coverage, and is a definitive source book for researchers.

Her book ''Later Chinese Bronzes'', ( {{ISBN|1870076117}}), published by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1990, broke new ground in the study of Chinese bronzes, and remains an important work of reference.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Based on the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the book explored a subject which was at that time new to art history, namely the identification, dating and use of bronze vessels made in the Song-Qing dynasties.

She is honorary associate of the [[Needham Research Institute]] at [[Cambridge University]], and an honorary fellow at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She is a former chairman, and currently a trustee, of the Great Britain-China Education Trust;&lt;ref name=gbcc&gt;{{cite web|title=GBCC Trust Chairman becomes Honorary Citizen of Jingdezhen|url=http://www.gbcc.org.uk/news/gbcc-trust-chairman-becomes-honorary-citizen-of-jingdezhen.aspx|website=Great Britain China Centre|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Trustee of the [[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art]]; and Museum Expert Advisor for the Hong Kong Government. She is a former president of the [[Oriental Ceramic Society]] of London (2000-2003).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Kerr visits Asia frequently and has undertaken sabbaticals at the [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei, and the [[Shanghai Museum]]. She has taught at the universities of London, Sussex, Glasgow, and Oslo, and was a lecturer for the UK National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies for many years.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Honours==
In 2015, Kerr was created an honorary citizen of [[Jingdezhen]], China, the [[Jingdezhen porcelain|historic centre]] of [[Chinese porcelain]] production,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.martinrandall.com/dr-rose-kerr-porcelain Dr Rose Kerr becomes honorary citizen of China's porcelain capital.] Martin Randall Travel, 11 November 2015.

'''Rosie's Theater Kids''', formerly known as '''Rosie's Broadway Kids''', is a non-profit arts education organization started by actress and comedian [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. RTKids was founded in 2003 and continually provides training in dance, music, and drama for students attending New York City public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSIE'S THEATER KIDS details|url=https://www.charitybuzz.com/support/rosiestheaterkids|publisher=[[Charitybuzz]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the Maravel Arts Center, 445 W. 45th St., in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]].  The center is named for O'Donnel's teacher Pat Maravel who was instrumental in O'Donnell's interest in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;https://rosiestheaterkids.org/maravel-arts-center/#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Rosie's Theater Kids is an arts education organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children through the arts.
Using professional teaching artists, Rosie's Theater Kids offers classes in dance and music and a professional theater experience for children who might otherwise not have the opportunity.
Its goal is to inspire excellence, motivate learning, uplift the human spirit, and to instill a lifelong appreciation of the arts.

==Programs==

===PS Broadway===

PS Broadway is the RTKids in-school program for NYC public school fifth-
graders. During the year, RTKids staff members teach dance and music as part of a 15-week program that serves 22 schools throughout Manhattan. As part of this program, every class of students takes a free trip to see a Broadway musical and then participates in a question-and-answer session with performers, directors, conductors, and members of the production's technical staff. Each semester this program is wrapped up with a school assembly where the kids can perform for their peers, parents, and teachers.

===ACTE II (A Commitment to Excellence)===

ACTE II is Rosie's Theater Kids scholarship program in which outstanding graduates of PS Broadway get the opportunity to receive further training in free after-school classes in ballet, tap, jazz, voice, and drama. Part of ACTE II is the Summer Intensive: an all-day, Monday through Friday summer program that provides group classes and private lessons, preparing the students for a final performance for family, friends, and industry professionals.

===Spotlight on Fitness===

Developed in collaboration with a school-based health care program and the NYC Department of Education, Spotlight on Fitness (SoFit) is a physical education program that fulfills state and local curriculum requirements in both the arts and physical education.

===A+===

The newest initiative of RTKids, A+ (Arts-Plus) provides supplementary tools to 
enhance the academic achievement of the ACTE II students at the secondary level. This program includes after-school tutoring, High School admission guidance, private coaching and preparation for performing arts school auditions (both high school and collegiate), and professional PSAT and SAT preparatory classes. So far, with the individual coaching and assistance from RTKids, 100% of the 8th grade students were placed in competitive New York City performing arts high schools for the past two years.

==History==
In April 2003, Rosie's Theater Kids was founded by Rosie O'Donnell, Kelli Carpenter, and RBKids Artistic Director, Lori Klinger. Since introducing the program to its first school in Manhattan, RTKids has expanded to serve over 5,000 students at 22 schools in Harlem, Midtown West, Chelsea, Lower East Side, East Village, Chinatown, and Brooklyn.
The ACTE II program has also expanded, with new 5th grade students added annually from PS Broadway classes to a new "team" of students each year. Currently ACTE II has five teams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1687">'''Samuel Jesi''' (1789 – January 17, 1853) was an Italian engraver.

He was born in [[Milan]] in 1789, he was a pupil of [[Giuseppe Longhi]] at the [[Brera Academy]] of Milan. His first work (1821) was "The Abandonment of Hagar", engraved after a painting by [[Guercino]] in the Palazzo di Brera at Milan; this was followed (1834) by "The Madonna with St. John and St. Stephen", from a painting by [[Fra Bartolomeo]] in the [[Cathedral of Lucca]]. He then devoted himself to the works of [[Raphael]], whom he ably interpreted. His masterpiece is the group representing [[Pope Leo X]] with Cardinals Rossi and [[Giulio dei Medici]] (1834). While in Paris for the purpose of having it printed he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and received the ribbon of the [[Legion of Honor]]. In 1846 he began to work on his engraving of the "Cœna Domini", discovered in the Church of S. Onofrio, Florence, and attributed to Raphael. Meanwhile, he engraved the "Madonna della Vite." In 1849 he completed the drawing of the "Cœna Domini", but died in [[Florence]] before finishing the engraving.

'''San Martino a Gangalandi''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] parish (pieve) church in the Gangalandi neighborhood of [[Lastra a Signa]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. It is located via Leon Battista Alberti. Adjacent to the church is a small Museo Vicariale (Vicarial Museum) displaying some works of art.

==History==
The church in this district was first documented by 1108. A church was first erected in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-style in the 12th-century as an oratory for a Marian confraternity apparently established following the visit to Florence of [[Saint Peter Martyr]]. The dedication to [[St Martin of Tours]] suggests an earlier Carolingian and Frankish foundation. The church underwent a refurbishment in the 15th-century by the Renaissance architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.touringclub.it/destinazione/215234/pieve-di-s-martino-a-gangalandi Touring Club of Italy], short entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Midway along the left flank is a slim tall bell tower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oobJOE0pHLYC Arte e Storia] by Guido Carroci, 1895, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior is notable for frescoes (1433) in the chapel of the Baptistry by [[Bicci di Lorenzo]]. The 15th-century baptismal font has sculpted marble reliefs. Other paintings in the interior include:&lt;ref&gt;List derived from Italian Wikipedia entry&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Five Saints'' by [[Pietro Salvestrini]]
*''Madonna and Child between St Lawrence and the Guardian Angel'' attributed to [[Antonio del Ceraiolo]] 
*''Virgin of the Assumption between Saints Charles Borromeo, Bartholomew, Francis and Martin'' (1615) by [[Matteo Rosselli]] 
*''San Cristoforo'' (fresco left wall)
*''Life of St Donnino'' (13th-century) 
*''Annunciation'' attributed to [[Domenico Passignano]], derived from Oratory of Santissima Annunziata
*''Tomb of [[Agnolo Pandolfini]]'' (1421) 
*''Death of St Joseph'' by [[Francesco Conti]]

The adjacent museum, established in 1986 with the financing by the Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, displays a ''Madonna of the Humility'' (circa 1405) painted by [[Lorenzo Monaco]]. There is also a [[triptych]] attributed to Lorenzo di Bicci and to his son Bicci di Lorenzo: the panels depict ''Virgin giving her girdle to Saint Thomas'' in the center, flanked by Saints Nicholas of Bari, Andrew, John the Baptist, and Anthony the Abbot. The museum displays a ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Jacopo del Sellaio]]. Three panels depicting the ''Decollation of John the Baptist between Saints Francis of Paola and Carlo Borromeo'' attributed to [[Filippo Paladini]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.piccoligrandimusei.it/en/blog/portfolio_page/museum-of-sacred-art-of-san-martino-gangalandi/ Piccoli e Grandi Musei] website, entry on museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scagliola''''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaglia'', meaning "chips")  is a technique for producing [[stucco]] columns, [[sculpture]]s and other [[architecture|architectural]] elements that resemble [[inlay]]s in [[marble]] and [[semi-precious]] stones.&lt;ref&gt;''Scagliola.''

Scagliola is a composite substance made from [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]], [[glue]] and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colors and applied to a core, or desired pattern may be carved into a previously prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern's indentations are then filled with the colored, plaster-like scagliola composite, and then polished with [[flax oil]] for brightness, and wax for protection. The combination of materials and technique provides a complex texture, and richness of color not available in natural veined marbles.

A comparable material is [[terrazzo]]. "Marmorino" is a synonym, but scagliola and terrazzo should not be confused with [[plaster of Paris]], which is one ingredient.

== Method ==

Batches of pigmented plaster (ground [[alabaster]] or [[gypsum]]) modified with [[animal glue]] are applied to molds, armatures and pre-plastered wall planes in a manner that accurately mimics natural stone, [[breccia]] and marble. In one technique, veining is created by drawing strands of raw [[silk]] saturated in pigment through the plaster mix. Another technique involves [[trowel]]ling on several layers of translucent renders and randomly cutting back to a previous layer to achieve colour differential similar to [[jasper]]. When dry, the  damp surface was [[pumice]]d smooth, then buffed with a linen cloth impregnated with Tripoli (a siliceous [[rottenstone]]) and charcoal; finally it was buffed with oiled felt; [[beeswax]] was sometimes used for this purpose.  Because the colours are integral to the plaster, the pattern is more resistant to scratching than with other techniques, such as [[paint]]ing on [[wood]].

There are two scagliola techniques: in traditional ''Bavarian'' scagliola coloured batches of [[plaster of Paris]] are worked to a stiff, dough-like consistency. The plaster is modified with the addition of animal glues such as [[isinglass]] or hide glue. ''Marezzo scagliola'' or ''American scagliola'' is worked with the pigmented batches of plaster in a liquid state and relies mainly on the use of ''Keene's cement'', a unique gypsum plaster product in which plaster of Paris was steeped in alum or borate, then burned in a kiln and ground to a fine powder; invented around 1840, it sets to an exceptionally hard state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Prudon |first=Theodore H. M. |title=Simulating Stone, 1860–1940: Artificial Marble, Artificial Stone, and Cast Stone |journal=[[APT Bulletin]] |volume=21 |issue=3-4 |date=1989 |pages=79–91 |doi=10.2307/1504299 |jstor=1504299}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically used without the addition of animal glues. ''Marezzo scagliola'' is often called ''American scagliola'' because of its widespread use in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Slabs of ''Marezzo scagliola'' may be used as table tops. When set, scagliola is hard enough to be turned on a lathe to form vases, [[baluster]]s and finials.

== In history ==
While there is evidence of scagliola decoration in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] architecture, scagliola decoration became popular in [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] buildings in the 17th century, and was imitated throughout [[Europe]] until the 19th century. An early use of scagliola in England is in a fireplace at [[Ham House]], Surrey, which was brought from Italy along with the window cill in the reign of Charles II. This employs the use of a scagliola background which was then cut into to lay in the design. Superb altar frontals using this technique are to found at the Certosa di Loro at Padula in the Campania, South West Italy. In 1761, a scagliolisto, Domenico Bartoli, from Livorno arrived in London and was employed by William Constable of Burton Constable in Yorkshire. Here he produced two chimneypieces in white marble inlaid with the scagliola embellishments directly into cut matrices in the marble. Apart from the protective edges of altars at Padula this seems to the first use of this technique. In 1766, he went into partnership with Johannes Richter, possibly from Dresden, who may have brought a young Pietro Bossi with him. The name Bossi, however, is associated with a family of Northern Italian scagliolisti. Bartoli certainly supplied table tops to Ireland and one chimneypiece at Belvedere House in Dublin could be attributed to Richter. Their styles are very different. There is little evidence that either of them came to Ireland. Pietro Bossi though arrived in Dublin in 1784 and probably died there in 1798. He produced a number of chimneypieces in Dublin of very good quality. Scagliola inlay proved to be desirable in Ireland and there appears to be  a continuation long after it became unfashionable in England. In 1911, Herbert Cescinsky, in ''English Furniture''remarked that scagliola had been popular in Dublin fifty years before. This would explain one at 86, Stephen's Green, clearly an 18th. Century chimneypiece, which has been later embellished in the mid 19th. Century for Crofton Vanderleur, formerly at 4, Parnell Square. A later firm, Sharpe &amp; Emery, Pearce St., Dublin produce a number of examples in the neo-classical Bossi style, sometimes using original chimneypieces.


The correspondence between [[British Resident]] in Florence Sir Horace Mann and [[Horace Walpole]] describes the process of obtaining a prized scagliola table top. Having received his first top from the Irishman Friar Ferdinando Henrico Hugford (1695–1771) around 1740 Walpole had asked his friend Mann to acquire some more... 
(one of these tables is at [[The Vyne]]. That table has the arms of Walpole (with his post 1726 Garter Knight embellishments) impaling Shorter - for Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Walpole]] and his first wife Catherine Shorter, who died 20 August 1737. He married Maria Skerret in early 1738, thus The Vyne's table could seem have been ordered before c1736-37).

In a letter dated 26 November 1741 Mann writes to Walpole:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your scagliola table was near finished when behold the stone on which the stuff is put, opened of itself so that all that was done, to his [Hugford's] great mortification is spoilt. He would have been off for beginning again on account of his eyes etc., but I have begged he will do it and he is about it&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and on 15 July 1742:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your scagliola table is almost finished (you remember the first he [Hugford] undertook broke when near done) and is very handsome, but even in this commission my success is not complete, for I cannot persuade the padre [Hugford] to make its companion&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and on 30 October 1742:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your scagliola table is finished, though I have not got it home. The nasty priest [Hugford] will have 25 zecchins [£12 10s] besides many thanks, for the preference given to me, for some simple English have been tampering with him and offered 30 to get it, though it is by no means such a fine performance. The priest wishes I would not take it, as he would make a present of it to the Pope. He leaves Florence for good&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and on 11 July 1747:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You bid me get you two scagliola tables, but don't mention the size or any other particulars. The man who made yours is no longer in Florence. Here is a scholar of his [Don Pietro Belloni?], but vastly inferior to him, and so slow in working that he has been almost three years about a pair for a Mr Leson [Joseph Leeson], and requires still six months more. I will endeavour to get somebody to write to the first friar [Hugford] and to engage him to make two tables in his convent and send them to Florence, of which I hope to be able to give you an account by next post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and on 10 October 1749:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am glad your scagliola tables please. You must make the greater account of them, as it is impossible to get any more of the same man [Hugford], nor indeed of his disciple here [Belloni], who is a priest too, and has been four years about a pair I bespoke of him, which he tells me plainly he cannot finish in less than two more. They work for diversion and won't be hurried.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern times—Tusmore House, Oxfordshire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great triumph of the saloon, however, is the use of scagliola, including the richly coloured and figured Sienna shafts of the eight fluted Corinthian columns...and the urns, entablature and balustrade to the second-floor landing which gives access to four plaster-vaulted ante rooms serving the main bedrooms. All this scagliola was produced by Richard Feroze, England's leading contemporary scagliola-maker.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin Robinson in ''Country Life'', December 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
 
Italian plasterworkers produced scagliola columns and pilasters for [[Robert Adam]] at [[Syon House]] (notably the columns in the Anteroom) and at [[Kedleston]] (notably the pilasters in the Saloon). In 1816 the [[Coade stone|Coade Ornamental Stone Manufactory]] extended their practice to include scagliola; their scagliola was used by [[Benjamin Dean Wyatt]] at [[Apsley House]], London.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Ruch, "Regency Coade: A Study of the Coade Record Books, 1813–21" ''Architectural History'' '''11''' (1968, pp. 34–56, 106–107) pp. 35, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] scagliola was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries. Important US buildings featuring scagliola include the [[Mississippi State Capitol]] in Jackson, Mississippi (1903), [[Allen County Courthouse (Indiana)|Allen County Courthouse]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], [[Belcourt Castle]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in the old [[Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum|El Paso County Courthouse (Colorado)]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], in the [[Kansas State Capitol]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in [[Shea's Performing Arts Center]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], and in the Navarro County Courthouse in Corsicana, TX. [[St. Louis Union Station]] in St. Louis, Missouri, prominently features scagliola in its magnificent Grand Hall, the [[Rialto Square Theatre]], Joliet, IL, [[Cathedral of St. Helena]] in Helena, MT, Congregation Shearith Israel in New York City, Milwaukee Public Library [[Central Library (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Central Library]] in Milwaukee, WI and the [[French Lick Resort Casino]], French Lick, IN which recently underwent a major restoration.

Scagliola has historically been considered an [[ersatz]] material and an inexpensive alternative to natural stone. However, it has eventually come to be recognised as an exceptional example of the plasterer's craft and is now prized for its historic value as well as being used in new construction because of its benefits as a plastic material suited to molding in ornate shapes.

Scagliola columns are not generally built of the solid material. Instead scagliola is trowelled onto a canvas which is wrapped around the column's core, and the canvas peeled away when semi-hardened. The scagliola is then surfaced in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Staehli |first=Alfred M. |title=Scagliola: Restoration of an Antique Plaster Finish in the Portland City Hall, Oregon |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=1984 |pages=44–50 |doi=10.2307/1494001 |jstor=1494001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
all repeats of previous information:== Scagliola nowadays ==
As rich in texture as it is in history, Scagliola is a technique developed by impoverished Italian monks in the 17th century. It is the art of crushing and mixing together chips of limestone, travertine and/or marble, and layering the paste by hand into hand-carved molds. Once the product has dried, it is then sanded and polished manually. Scagliola does not need to be faux finished and can be used in interior and exterior applications. This historical technique is still in use nowadays by many different companies.
--&gt;

The Verde Antique columns and pilasters in the Ante Room at Syon House are made out of marble not Scagliola as it is widely perceived (a beautiful and rare, predominantly green marble that was quarried in Larissa of Greece since antiquity). The intriguing fact with these columns is that they are not solid. Round sections of marble were painstakingly cut as a veneer of an approximate thickness of 5–6&amp;nbsp;mm and then glued onto a column core that is hollow and was made out of, probably, plaster. On closer inspection the viewer can see the joints of the various sections and the discerning eye will soon realise that what he/she is looking at is in fact Verde Antique veneered marble and not Verde Antique Scagliola.  The 3.6 metre high Verde Antique Scagliola columns that can be seen at Dropmore House, Buckinghamshire, are based on the colours and design of this historical work at Syon House and both research and execution of these new columns were undertaken recently by the contemporary Scagliolist Michael Koumbouzis.

'''''Shared Visions''''' is a book sharing the voices of persons with a [[visual impairment]]. The book was published by [[Danish Association of the Blind]] (“Dansk Blindesamfund") in autumn 2012.

==Contents==
The book consists of 16 interviews with persons who are blind or have low vision from all continents of the world including [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Rwanda]].

The interviews depict the individual differences from one person to the other, but also show certain communalities and demonstrate the strong will and preparedness to struggle to fulfill dreams and participate in the fight for the improvement of conditions for visually impaired persons nationally and internationally.

==Background==
Historically, ever since issues on the implications and conditions facing persons with a visual impairment (blind or low vision) became articulated, it has mostly been [[teacher]]s and [[psychologist]]s that have told the stories and given the examples. Some specific books about individual persons and their experiences, achievements and struggles have occasionally emerged, but very few books have been published where a number of persons with a visual impairment tell their stories and paint a picture of their lives.

This book has been published in order to give visually impaired people their own voices in describing their own lives.

==Publication==
Shared Visions is edited by John Heilbrunn, Vice-President of Danish Association of the Blind, [[Denmark]], as a tribute to persons within the blindness movement around the World and a celebration of the centennial of the Danish organization of the blind.

'''''Showtime at the Apollo''''' (formerly '''''It's Showtime at the Apollo''''' and '''''Apollo Live''''') is a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] music television show, first broadcast on September 12, 1987 to May 24, 2008 with 1093 episodes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/show/4104/summary.html Premiered: September 12, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wistelevision.com/apollo.html It's Showtime at the Apollo began its successful 15-year run in 1987, but the show's beginnings reach all the way back to 1913.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is produced by the Apollo Theater. In 2018, the series returned on Fox with Steve Harvey hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=Deadline Hollywood|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/showtime-at-the-apollo-fox-weekly-series-steve-harvey-host-1202071010/|website=‘Showtime At The Apollo’: Fox Orders Weekly Series For Next Season; Steve Harvey Hosts|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show features live performances from both professional and up-and-coming artists, and also features the Amateur Night competition made popular at the famous [[Apollo Theater]] in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, where the show is recorded. The series was rebooted as ''Apollo Live'' and hosted by [[comedian]] [[Tony Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bet.com/shows/apollo-live/cast/tony-rock.html |title=Apollo Live|last= |first= |date= |website=[[BET.com]]|access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cities such as New York (where it aired on [[WNBC]]), it often aired after ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on early Sunday mornings, and was often paired with the similarly-syndicated ''[[Soul Train]]''.

A live non-televised version of the show takes place every Wednesday (which is the original Apollo Amateur Night competition that has been running for over 70 years), with the taped version of the show for television being recorded in advance on other nights for later airing.

==Hosts==
Many famous [[R&amp;B]], soul, and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] performers have appeared on the show, which has had a number of hosts, including [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Rick Aviles]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]], [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]], [[Steve Harvey]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Christopher "Kid" Reid]], and [[Anthony Anderson]]. [[Kiki Shepard]] served as co-host from 1987 until 2002.

From 1989 to 1991, Sinbad served as the permanent host. After Sinbad left, the show reverted to a series of special guest hosts. In 1993, [[Steve Harvey]] began a seven-year stint as the permanent host. At the start of the 1998–99 season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/showtime-at-the-apollo/show/4104/episode_listings.html?season=12&amp;tag=nav_bar;12 Season 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118182834/http://www.tv.com/showtime-at-the-apollo/show/4104/episode_listings.html?season=12 |date=January 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Kiki Sheppard hosted a series of ''"Best of..."'' episodes until late October because production was delayed due to a labor dispute. After Harvey left in 2000, he was replaced by [[Rudy Rush]]. Rush was joined by new comedic dancer C.P. Lacey, who replaced [[Howard Sims|Howard "Sandman" Sims]], who had died. Harvey returned to host the Fox revival of ''Showtime at the Apollo'', beginning on March 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macke|first1=Johnni|title=Steve Harvey Announces The Return Of A Classic Series On FOX|url=http://peopleschoice.com/2018/02/08/steve-harvey-announces-the-return-of-a-classic-series-on-fox/|website=People's Choice|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stitching the Standard''''' is a painting by British artist [[Edmund Leighton]]. It depicts a nameless damsel on the [[battlement]]s of a medieval castle making the finishing touches to a standard or pennant with a black eagle on a gold background. In a time of peace the woman has taken her needlework into the daylight away from the bustle of the castle.

The painting represents late [[Pre-Raphaelitism]], when life was untarnished by [[World War I]]. ''Stitching the Standard'' is probably listed as ''The Device'' by Leighton's biographer Alfred Yockney among the pictures from 1911.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L11133.html/f/51/L11133-51.pdf| title =Victorian &amp; Edwardian Art|publisher =[[Sotheby's]]|date=15 November 2011| accessdate = 28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 1928 the painting appeared at [[Christie's]] under the title '''''Preparing the Flag''''' and was bought by W. W.

'''''The Awakening Conscience''''' (1853) is an [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by the English artist [[William Holman Hunt]], one of the founders of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], which depicts a young woman rising from her position in the lap of a man and gazing transfixed out of the window of a room.

The painting is in the collection of the [[Tate Britain]] in London.

==Subject matter==
Initially, the painting appears to depict a momentary disagreement between husband and wife, but the title and a host of symbols within the painting make it clear that this is a mistress and her lover. The woman's clasped hands provide a focal point and the position of her left hand emphasizes the absence of a wedding ring. Around the room are dotted reminders of her "kept" status and her wasted life: the cat beneath the table toying with a bird; the clock concealed under glass; a tapestry which hangs unfinished on the piano; the threads which lie unravelled on the floor; the print of [[Frank Stone (painter)|Frank Stone]]'s ''Cross Purposes'' on the wall; [[Edward Lear]]'s musical arrangement of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem "[[Tears, Idle Tears]]" which lies discarded on the floor, and the music on the piano, [[Thomas Moore]]'s "Oft in the Stilly Night", the words of which speak of missed opportunities and sad memories of a happier past. The discarded glove and top hat thrown on the table top suggest a hurried assignation.

The room is too cluttered and gaudy to be in a Victorian family home; the bright colours, unscuffed carpet, and pristine, highly polished furniture speak of a room recently furnished for a mistress. Art historian [[Elizabeth Prettejohn]] notes that although the interior is now viewed as "Victorian" it still exudes the "'nouveau-riche' vulgarity" that would have made the setting distasteful to contemporary viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn 2000, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting's frame is decorated with further symbols: bells (for warning), marigolds (for sorrow), and a star above the girl's head (a sign of spiritual revelation). It also bears a verse from the [[Book of Proverbs]] (25:20): "As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=6996&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10 Tate], Short Text.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mirror on the rear wall provides a tantalizing glimpse out of the scene. The window — opening out onto a spring garden, in direct contrast to the images of entrapment within the room — is flooded with sunlight. The woman's face does not display a look of shock that she has been surprised with her lover; whatever attracts her is outside of both the room and her relationship. The ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' commented in 1854:

{{quote|The author of "The Bridge of Sighs" could not have conceived a more painful-looking face. The details of the picture, the reflection of the spring trees in the mirror, the piano, the bronze under the lamp, are wonderfully true, but the dull indigoes and reds of the picture make it melancholy and appropriate, and not pleasing in tone. The sentiment is of the Ernest Maltravers School: to those who have an affinity for it, painful; to those who have not, repulsive.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt vol.1 p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]" was a poem by [[Thomas Hood]] about a prostitute who commits suicide by jumping into the Thames from a bridge. ''Ernest Maltravers'' was a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] about a love affair between an aristocrat and a poor girl.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Hunt Light of the World.jpg|right|thumb|''The Light of the World'']]
In some ways this painting is a companion to Hunt's Christian painting ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]'', a picture of Christ holding a lantern as he knocks on an overgrown handleless door which Hunt said represented "the obstinately shut mind".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt vol.1 p.350&lt;/ref&gt; The young woman here could be responding to that image, her conscience pricked by something outside of herself. Hunt intended this image to be ''The Light of the World'''s "material counterpart in a picture representing in actual life the manner in which the appeal of the spirit of heavenly love calls a soul to abandon a lower life."&lt;ref name="H429"&gt;Hunt p.429&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'' Hunt wrote that Peggotty's search for Emily in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' had given him the idea for the composition and he began to visit "different haunts of [[fallen woman|fallen girls]]" looking for a suitable setting. He did not plan to recreate any particular scene from ''David Copperfield''; he initially wanted to capture something more general: "the loving seeker of the fallen girl coming upon the object of his search",&lt;ref name="H429" /&gt; but he reconsidered, deciding that such a meeting would engender different emotions in the girl than the repentance he wanted to show. He eventually settled on the idea that the girl's companion could be singing a song that suddenly reminded her of her former life and thereby act as the unknowing catalyst for her epiphany.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt p.430&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the girl was [[Annie Miller]], who sat for many of the Pre-Raphaelites and to whom Hunt was engaged until 1859. The male figure may be based on [[Thomas Seddon]] or [[Augustus Egg]], both painter friends of Hunt.

==Repainting==
The look on the girl's face in the modern painting is not the look of pain and horror that viewers saw when the painting was first exhibited, and which shocked and repulsed many of the contemporary critics. The painting was commissioned by [[Thomas Fairbairn]], a Manchester industrialist and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, after Egg discussed Hunt's ideas and possibly showed him some of the initial sketches.&lt;ref name="TIC"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=6996&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=8 Tate], Illustrated Companion.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbairn paid Hunt 350 guineas. The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1854, along with ''The Light of the World''.  Fairbairn found himself unable to bear looking on the woman's expression day-to-day, so persuaded Hunt to soften it.  Hunt started work but fell ill and allowed the painting to be returned to Fairbairn for display at the Birmingham Society of Artists exhibition in 1856 before he was completely happy with the result. Later he was able to work on it again and confided to [[Edward Lear]] that he thought he had "materially bettered it".&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|In a footnote Gissing claims that Hunt regretted agreeing to Fairbairn's request change the girl's expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gissing p.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} As noted in the [[spandrel]]s, Hunt retouched the painting in 1864 and again in 1886 when he repaired some work that had been carried out by a restorer in the interim.&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;

==Views of John Ruskin==
The Victorian art theorist [[John Ruskin]] praised ''The Awakening Conscience'' as an example  of a new direction in British art in which the narrative was created from the artist's imagination rather than chronicling an event. Ruskin's reading of the painting was also to a moral end.  In an 1854 letter to ''[[The Times]]'' defending the work, he claimed that there is "not a single object in all that room...but it becomes tragical if read rightly".&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;Ruskin in Barringer, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; He was struck by both the stark realism of the room — Hunt had hired a room in a "maison de convenance" (where lovers would take their mistresses) in order to capture the feeling — and the symbolic overtones and compared the revelation of the subjects' characters through the interiors favourably with that of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]''.&lt;ref name="RB" /&gt; 
The "common, modern, vulgar" interior is overwhelmed by lustrous, unworn objects that will never be part of a home. To Ruskin, the exquisite detail of the painting only called attention to the inevitable ruin of the couple: "The very hem of the poor girl's dress, at which the painter has laboured so closely, thread by thread, has story in it, if we think how soon its pure whiteness may be soiled with dust and rain, her outcast feet failing in the street".&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin in Prettejohn 2005, p.111–113&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of a visual [[morality tale]], based on a single moment, influenced [[Augustus Egg]]'s 1858 series of three paintings, ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]''.

==In Literature==
In Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'', an allusion to the painting reflects the unraveling of the affair between Julia Flyte and artist Charles Ryder. 

==Provenance==
The painting was inherited by Fairbairn's son, Sir Arthur Henderson Fairbairn, 3rd Baronet. It was sold anonymously at [[Christie's]] in January 1946 and had been bought by Colin Anderson by 1947. It was donated to the [[Tate Gallery]] by Sir Colin and Lady Anderson in 1976.&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;

'''''The Farmers' Lunch''''' (''Almuerzo de campesinos'') is one of the earliest paintings by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Diego Velázquez]]. Painted in oil on canvas in 1618, it combines a [[still life]] of food and drink with a depiction of three comic farmers, whose [[physiognomy]] the artist studies closely. The composition shows a younger man gesturing with his right hand to reinforce the story coming from his half-open lips, and an older man listening attentively while holding his cup up to a woman so she can refill it with wine. The still life includes fish, bread, a carrot, a lemon, and a copper vessel.

''The Farmers' Lunch'' is nearly identical to  another painting by Velázquez, ''[[The Lunch (Velázquez)|The Lunch]]'' (ca. 1617).

==Synopsis==
A merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe, he raises the boy with her until he takes the boy on a trip and sells him into [[slavery]].

The '''Cathedral of St. Lawrence''' ({{lang-hr|Katedrala Sv. Lovre}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] triple-naved [[basilica]] constructed in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in [[Trogir]], [[Croatia]]. Since its construction lasted several centuries, it illustrates all the styles that succeeded one another in [[Dalmatia]]. It serves now as the most imposing monument in the city of Trogir.

==History==
It was built on the foundations of an [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] cathedral destroyed in the 12th century during the sack of the town by the [[Saracens]] in 1123. The building of the cathedral began in 1213 and finished during the 17th century. Like the older one, it is also dedicated to St. Lawrence (Sveti Lovro) but it is better known as St. John's Cathedral (Sveti Ivan) after [[John of Trogir|bishop John]], who died in 1111 and stood out for his saintly lifestyle at a time when the Hungarian King Koloman had taken over Dalmatia and Croatia. Most of the work in the construction of the cathedral took place in the 13th century, being largely completed in 1251. That means the building is mainly in Romanesque style, whilst the vault inside is gothic as it was built during the 15th century, in [[Mannerist]] style.

Work on the bell tower began at the end of the 14th century, but it was not completed until the end of the 16th century. The first floor is in Gothic style and was built by Masters Stejpan and Matej. After it had been demolished by the Venetians in 1420, it was restored by Matija Gojković.&lt;ref&gt;Naklada Naprijed, ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pg. 224, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-178-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor is in low Gothic style and was probably the work of Venetian masters, as it is reminiscent of the windows of the famous Venetian [[Ca' d'Oro|Palazzo Ca d'Oro]]. The final floor was built by Trifun Bokanić (1575–1609). On top of the bell tower there  are four statues, the work of Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria (1525–1608). In the centre of the facade, within a small round opening, there is the carved coat of arms of the most powerful King, Ludvic of Angevin dynasty.

==Description==
Trogir cathedral is the most archaic example in the construction of interior arcades in Dalmatia with heavy elongated piers separating the two Gothic-ribbed aisles from the nave, vaulted later also in Gothic style in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="Delalle"&gt;Ivo Delalle, Mirko Slade – Šilovič, Stanko Geič, ''Trogir: Small Touristic Monograph'', pg. 27, Studio HRG, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-97699-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; three semi-circular apses and a vaulted interior above which rises the Campanile. Unfortunately, only one of the two planned towers (the southern), was raised. The cross vaults and the earlier terraces above the aisles are of Apulian influence. 

A large '''vestibule''' was added in the 15th century and the artistically well-executed Gothic [[Rosette (window)|rosette]] on the western facade is from the same period. At the far end of the entrance hall there is a Gothic and Romanesque '''baptistery''' which was added to the cathedral in about 1467 by Andrija Aleši (1430–1504), a sculptor of Albanian origins and a pupil of Juraj Dalmatinac. The Gothic '''sacristy''' was added to the cathedral in the 15th century. The outside thick wall is divided by pilasters and pierced with arched opens.

===Romanesque portal===
The local architect and sculptor Master [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]] worked on the cathedral's gateway (main west portal) early in its construction. Most of the portal was carved by the master himself but some other hands are distinguishable, those of his pupils and followers. Finished and signed in 1240, it is a monumental and perhaps unique work of this great Croatian artist, of whom the inscription on the base of the lunette says: ''"the best of all in this artisanship"''.&lt;ref name="Delalle"/&gt; 

In terms of its thematic concept, the portal is divided into two parts: upper and lower. The upper part shows scenes from the Gospels, that is, the life of Christ. On the lunette there is the scene of the Nativity, and inside the arch above the lunette there are angels looking adoringly at the scene. The lunette and this arch are the work of Master Radovan. Over them there is another arch which also shows scenes from the life of Christ. On the interior of the doorposts there are pictures showing the various works done during the different seasons of the year. Radovan also worked on the two small columns covered in reliefs. On the exterior doorpost the saints and apostles are represented; the interior of the same posts are decorated with figures of exotic animals and fantastic creatures like centaurs and mermaids. Human forms dominate the portal. Both the internal and external doorposts rest on the back of bearers bent over, who are also the work of Radovan himself. Beside the portal, standing on the backs of two lions, stand the figures of Adam and Eve.

Other significant artisans who worked on the building were Matija Gojković, [[Ivan Budislavić]], Grgur Vidov, and Petar Pozdanić in the 15th century.

The cathedral is part of the historic core of Trogir, which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/810/ UNESCO World Heritage Site: Trogir]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''WomaNews''''' was a [[radical feminist]] [[newspaper]] that began in [[Gainesville, Florida]] in the 1970s before moving production to New York, New York. 

==Purposes==
Mainstream American newspapers addressed majority concerns and so different minority papers emerged in response to the need for a more comprehensive and multivocal approach to news. Women's sections in mainstream newspapers and women's newspapers provided a needed avenue for the dissemination of information and discussion of current concerns from and for women. The same is true for other minority newspapers, like the many [[African-American newspapers]] that covered human rights violations, oppression, and the beginnings of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], before mainstream newspapers offered regular or even-handed coverage.

[[File:Zangezi.gif|thumb|[[Velimir Khlebnikov|Khlebnikov's]] book ''Zangezi'' (1922).]]
'''Zaum''' ({{lang-ru|зáумь}}) are the linguistic experiments in [[sound symbolism]] and [[artistic language|language creation]] of [[Russian Futurism|Russian-empire Futurist poets]] such as [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksei Kruchenykh]].

Coined by Kruchenykh in 1913,{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=2}} the word ''zaum'' is made up of the Russian prefix [[:wikt:за|за]] "beyond, behind" and noun [[:wikt:ум|ум]] "the mind, ''[[nous]]''" and has been translated as '''"transreason"''', '''"transration"''' or '''"beyonsense"''' ([[Paul Schmidt (translator)|Paul Schmidt]]).{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=1}} According to scholar Gerald Janecek, ''zaum'' can be defined as experimental poetic language characterized by indeterminacy in meaning.{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=1}}

Kruchenykh, in “Declaration of the Word as Such (1913),” declares zaum “a language which does not have any definite meaning, a transrational language” that “allows for fuller expression” whereas, he maintains, the common language of everyday speech “binds.”{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=78}} He further maintained, in “Declaration of Transrational Language (1921),” that zaum “can provide a universal poetic language, born organically, and not artificially, like [[Esperanto]]."{{sfn|Kruchenykh|2005|p=183}}

Examples of zaum include Kruchenykh's poem "[[Dyr bul shchyl]]",{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=49}} Kruchenykh's libretto for the Futurist opera ''[[Victory over the Sun]]'' with music by [[Mikhail Matyushin]] and stage design by [[Kazimir Malevich]],{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=111}} and Khlebnikov's so-called "[[language of the birds]]", "[[language of the gods]]" and "language of the stars".{{sfn|Janecek|1996|pp=137–138}} The poetic output is perhaps comparable to that of the contemporary [[Dadaism]] but the linguistic theory or metaphysics behind zaum was entirely devoid of the gentle self-irony of that movement and in all seriousness intended to recover the [[sound symbolism]] of a lost [[glottogony|aboriginal tongue]].{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=79}} Exhibiting traits of a Slavic [[national mysticism]], Kruchenykh aimed at recovering the primeval Slavic mother-tongue in particular.

In modern times, since 1962 [[Serge Segay]] was creating zaum poetry.&lt;ref name="У Голубой Лагуны"&gt;''[[Кузьминский, Константин Константинович|Кузьминский К.]], Ковалёв Г.'' [http://www.kkk-bluelagoon.ru/tom5b/transpoety.htm Антология новейшей русской поэзии у Голубой Лагуны]. — Т. 5Б.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ry Nikonova|Rea Nikonova]] started creating zaum verses probably a bit later, around 1964.&lt;ref name="Zhumati"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Жумати
| first = Т. П.
| title = «Уктусская школа» (1965-1974) : К истории уральского андеграунда
| journal = Известия Уральского государственного университета
| date = 1999
| volume = 13
| pages = 125–127
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their zaum poetry can be seen e.g. in issues of famous "Transponans" samizdat magazine.&lt;ref name="Transponans"&gt;[http://samizdatcollections.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/samizdat%3Atransponans Transponans, made available online by Toronto University]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, contemporary [[avant-garde]] poet Sergei Biriukov has founded an association of poets called the "Academy of Zaum" in [[Tambov]].

The use of Zaum peaked from 1916 to 1920 during [[World War I]]. At this time, Zaumism took root as a movement primarily involved in [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]es, [[art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]],{{sfn|Janecek|1984|pp=149–206}} and concentrated its [[anti war]] politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Zaum activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publications. The movement influenced later styles, [[Avant-garde]] and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[surrealism]], [[nouveau réalisme]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Fluxus]].{{sfn|Knowlson|1996|p=217}}
